Breaking down 'too good to be true' Defi rates – where's the money from, is it sustainable, and what's the catch?

Money doesn't just grow on ~~trees~~ blockchains, not even *magic internet money*. And yet some defi applications are offering astronomical rates. For this post, I'll break down three common types of protocols and answer the following questions: *where's the money from? Is it sustainable? And what's the catch?*

# Lending and Borrowing

Examples; Aave, Anchor, Geist, Solend

Typical rates: Less than 10% net

**Where's the money from?** Similar to a bank, users deposit money into the protocol, which is then used by borrowers. To borrow money, users have to pay an interest rate and also deposit collateral into the protocol. The main source of revenue is sourced from the interest borrowers have to pay. Some protocols also stake the collateral that users deposit and earn extra income from that.

**Is it sustainable?** Most lending rates aren't actually that high (2% to 20%) since they are usually balanced out by the borrowing rates at an equivalent rate. So the main question here is, *why are people lending/borrowing?*

Beyond earning deposit fees, people lend because the majority of defi requires users to hold assets that they would otherwise not want to hold.  If a user wanted to use defi while holding the assets that they prefer to hold like BTC and ETH, they would deposit their assets as collateral and borrow against it.

People borrow because they can earn a yield higher than the rate they're paying to borrow. You could for example, borrow a stablecoin at a 10% borrow rate and then deposit the borrowed funds into a stablecoin liquidity pool that earns you 20%. You keep the extra 10%.

**What's the catch?** If you're not borrowing, the rates are oftentimes very low and you're likely better off staking an asset than lending or even using Cefi. For example, the largest lending/borrowing dapps are Aave, Compound, or Cream and they only offer **&lt;3%** for ETH whereas ETH Cefi rates are **\~6%**.

If you are borrowing, there's no bank to hold your hand and no bailouts. If your collateral falls below a certain amount, the protocols deems you ineligible to pay off your loan and you get liquidated. This can happen if the market falls and you're not watching your funds. However, there are protocols that now allow for liquidity-free lending/borrow.

# Liquidity Pools (LPs)

Examples: Uniswap, Curve, Serum, Raydium, TraderJoe, SpookySwap, Quickswap

Typical rates: 20% to 40% net (for stablecoins, BTC, and ETH)

**Where's the money from?** When you use decentralize exchanges (dexes), there are liquidity provider fees that typically charge 0.25% of trades. The trading fee is the main source of income for LPs.

**Is it sustainable?** At its current state, most LPs are not sustainable. While the demand for LPs like ETH-DAI is pretty straightforward, demand for LPs with, sometimes obscure, protocol or farm tokens are not as clear. Oftentimes, they rely on circular dependencies, ie *finance for the sake of finance.*

As an example, let's take a look at how degen yield farming typically happens:

1. Protocols offer a 1,000% rate for FARM-DAI LP providers
2. Higher rates mean higher inflation, which means the value of the FARM token tend to decrease
3. But the high rate creates demand for the FARM token as users have to buy FARM to join the LP
4. The high demand pumps the price of the FARM token and offsets the high inflation
5. But as the LP participants grow, the rates decrease
6. Lower rates cause lower demand, which means prices are no longer getting pumped
7. At some point, the farm reaches a stage where both prices and rates are going down
8. And when that happens, degens who are merely looking for quick money, tend to leave
9. More and more people leaving and selling the token causes the price to drop

For most farms, specifically ""degen farms"", prices spike early making the LP seem more profitable than it actually is and then high inflation does its thing to prices slowly but surely fall. Most users enter and leave farms within 3 days to capture the parabolic price action and high rewards.

Protocols can avoid this by providing a legitimate use case for the FARM token beyond just earning a high yield. For pure LP protocols, the use cases are typically governance, which is not very appealing for retail who couldn't care any less about how some protocols are governed.

**What's the catch?** Even if the LP rates are very high, a drastic enough drop in price can offset the gains earned from the reward rate. This is especially true for users who were late and were not able to accumulate the rewards. This is why it's often recommended to look into the price action and avoid making decisions based off of rates alone.

LPs, specifically low liquidity ones, are also especially vulnerable to whales who can often cause spikes–both in the upside, when buying, and the downside, when selling. And large spikes can cause a domino effect of mass selling and whoever is left holding the bag gets rekt.

Beyond this, impermanent loss (IP) is the most obvious catch. Participating in LPs typically requires you to split your assets meaning you may be exposed to undesired price action. But there are several ways to avoid or mitigate IP such as participating in stablecoin LPs or LPs with relatively low volatility, ie BTC or ETH. In addition, there's a lot of work going into new protocols to limit the impact of impermanent loss.

# Reserve Currencies

Examples: Olympus DAO, Wonderland, KlimaDAO

Typical rates: 6,000% to 8,000% (current)

**Where's the money from?** Reserve currencies are brought at a premium that's worth several magnitudes (8-10x) more than the intrinsic value of the token. New tokens are minted at an extremely high rate and then distributed as a reward to stakers. A combination of selling at a high premium and minting at a high rate leads to the high APYs.

But, similar to how LPs work, high distribution –&gt; high inflation –&gt; lower prices. At the same time, high rates –&gt; high participation –&gt; lower rates. The expectation is for both rewards to slowly decrease to a target rate of 1,000%. The goal is to accumulate long-term participants because long time horizons would ensure that staking rewards eventually offsets price action.

**Is it sustainable?** Under the hood, the economics are designed similar to LPs. But LPs are often subject to the notion of *finance for the sake of finance* because the only product is often the high yields offered. Reserve currencies have a secondary revenue generating product: bonds, which are means for protocols to accumulate their own liquidity. So the question to be asked here is *why is there a demand for bonds?*

Bonds allow for protocol-owned liquidity, seeking to address the aforementioned issues that often make LPs unsustainable. Instead of protocols renting liquidity to mercenary users who come and go looking for the highest yields, bonding allows protocols to own their own liquidity and provide a sense of stability. This reduces the need for protocols to constantly offer unsustainably high rates in order to incentivize users to participate in their LP. In addition, it allows protocols to earn their own LP fees, which can give them another source of revenue.

**What's the catch?** LP protocols actually incur some costs in exchange for partnering with the bonding program of a reserve currency protocol. And while reserve protocols offer users with more incentives to become long-term participants, they can still always exit and sell the LPs. This may the case during volatile swings.

On the user end, buying bonds usually isn't worth it primarily because reserve protocols typically requires users to wait a certain interval (3-7 days, etc.) while holding the LPs. This presents some risks because the LPs can drop in value and, thus, offset the discounts. Additionally, if users buy the reserve currency token directly, they can immediately maximize the staking yields, which are also often higher than the discounts.

Overall, the long-term utility of the reserve protocol hinges on the demand for bonds. Most reserve currencies are still very new so only time will tell moving forward. Beyond questioning the bonds, reserve currencies are still vulnerable to bank runs, however these risks are designed to be mitigated with how the protocol works.

moon-worshiper,"Discovery was a Cable channel. WarnerMedia was movie theater productions, with HBO for Cable Subscription productions. Discovery depends on cable advertisements for their productions.

daksh60500,"I can sort of answer this since I’m doing CFA and CS. I’d say these are v different obviously but your motivation matters more in tech, which makes it harder. For example, if money is your primary motivator, then understanding financial statements are hell of a lot easier than doing computer systems or DS&amp;A, simply because the former relates directly to money, and gives a more fundamental understanding of it.

The fields also evolve very differently. In finance, the field is very slow to evolve, but tech is extremely fast (comparing on a macro scale). This means the learning curve in finance is a less steep with age as compared to tech.

In the end though, I’d say your experience in CS is highly dependent on the quality of your teacher, especially since there’s quite a bit to learn.

MajorasButtplug,"I actually believe stablecoin staking is one of the best advantages of DeFi for FIRE people, and use it a good bit. The reason I was interested in this sub actually was because of how many times the main FI sub shit on me just for trying to explain how these work to people. I do think the ridiculously high returns are temporary, but in the sense of there's a limited number of years (so still quite a bit of time) before rates come in line with other options

Compound Finance is a decent example of this. It started out averaging ~10% on USDC/Dai for the first 2ish years for me. Now the protocol has grown, expanded borrowing options and proved itself, and you hardly ever see rates above ~5%. If you were to snoop long enough in my post history you'd find me claiming I believe eventually stablecoin lending will likely end up somewhere around mortgage rates in the long run.

&amp;nbsp;

There are still great options now though, depending on what you're comfortable with. 

* Aave/CF are still decent interest and pretty well proven at this point. 

* Anchor should have a nice rate for a good while since being subsidized by TFL. 

* If you're willing to take a relatively small liquidation risk, you can get ~56% on UST through Abracadabra where you're only liquidated if UST drops to $0.80... During the May dip it de-pegged temporarily to ~$0.93, so $0.80 is pretty safe imo. 

* Curve pools can get you ~15%, at the cost of exposure to USDT

&amp;nbsp;

Personally I keep a good bit of my assets in stablecoin lending protocols. So if you have any questions, I *might* be able to answer them.",2021-12-02 04:53:25

Local-Seat-4730,"You didn't say that so how would anyone know lol? What have been my vehicles over last 10 years? Applying your logic if you don't know then that makes you ""slow"".

Hinting that I am ""slow"" when you are trading in Rams after 3 years is pretty bold considering average depreciation for Rams are about 43% per 5 years which isn't the worst ever but I'd say that depreciation curve is probably a lot steeper at 3 years than at 5. So you are trading in each truck for a tremendous loss, especially if you are selling back to the dealer. I've noticed that people who trade in like this never actually own a vehicle, it's always financed so the bank owns it. People that buy cars with funds in hand never trade in to dealerships because you get robbed and it's really clear when you are talking dollars and not monthly payments which all dealerships hate.

No dealer will give you as much as privately selling your vehicles. I'm sure you don't consider this at the time because they roll it up into a big finance ""package"" and typically only talk about monthly payments ""hey we can keep your payment in the ballpark just give us that old one and look at this shiny plastic wow it's so badass"" and unfortunately most Americans are fooled that easily.

However in a way It's a good thing you trade in after 3 years because those vehicles fall apart at about 5 years and that's when they make a lot of money on the replacement parts.",2021-12-02 07:46:19

drsikes,"I can’t speak to the public health side of the degree but usually the biggest learning curve I’ve seen with MBAs without a business background is the quantitative side of the MBA, specifically in accounting, economics, and finance. 

At my previous university, if a student didn’t have a business undergrad degree, we would actually require them to take a few undergrad courses in economics and accounting. Not saying this is a universal requirement, but it goes to show the heavy dependence of any business degree, undergrad or masters, on these 2 subject areas. 

If you’re curious about the heavy dependence of accounting and economics, I’ll try to illustrate why. 

Accounting is the absolute language of business which I hate to admit but it’s true. We communicate info about a business through numbers, and accounting gives us a way to standardize that information. 

Economics is not even taught as a business course at some universities but instead as a social science course (which is honestly what it is). It’s a study of how individuals make decisions as either an individual (micro) or an entity (macro). It’s focus on decision making I think is what truly makes it more of a social science than necessarily a business course.

Finance (my specialty) relies on both accounting data and economic ideas to do one thing…make money ;) Of course not all of healthcare is about making money, but projects still need to be evaluated, capital still needs to be raised, and day-to-day operations still needs to be managed so finance is still relevant even for non-profits.

Consistent-Ad-5885,"Yes, the potential yield and low gas fees makes it well worth it. 

Like one of the other comments says, it’s smart to use exchange with polygon native withdrawals. Swap the BTC &amp; ETH to MATIC, and withdraw from the exchange directly to your MetaMask address (selecting MATIC network). Once the Matic is on MetaMask, you can use quickswap to convert the MATIC back to the respective amounts of wBTC and wETH. 

Assuming you want to just hold the coins for a while, you have some options on more ways to earn interest just for holding on the Matic network. You can store the BTC and ETH on Aave, where you’ll earn roughly 2% APY in Matic tokens. This also gives you access to lending and borrowing. 

To earn more APY, you can borrow USDC using the BTC and ETH as collateral, and use this USDC to become a liquidity provider on sites like curve, quickswap, or Mai Finance. Rates on Mai Finance are around 30%, paid out in Qi tokens that can be claimed at any time and used to slowly accumulate more BTC or ETH; whenever you want to exit, just withdraw your initial liquidity deposit and payoff the loan. Just be sure to maintain a good LTV on aave to avoid liquidation — I usually keep my borrow value around 45% my collateral value just to be safe.",2021-12-03 09:46:38

GringoAdvisor,"Biased, conflict-ridden answer: I am a (very unavailable, over capacity, please don't ask) planner. I find this and other finance subs wildly entertaining. Not because everyone here is incompetent (a lot of you are doing great!), but there is an enormous trade of unqualified information, so shit can get interesting.

I say that to intentionally highlight that it's not exactly different on the other side. There are competent and incompetent people everywhere, in every profession. I've had some minor medical issues the past few years, and it's been a reminder that as clients/patients/customers, we all need to do our due diligence on who we are speaking with and make our own judgement calls on who we can trust.

Qualifications and billing strategies aren't the litmus test people think they are. I spoke with a gentleman this week who is a CFP, who came to me for advice on growing his practice, and about 30 minutes into the conversation I realized that he wasn't aware of how distributions on retirement accounts are taxed. He looks great on paper, and has all the right intentions, but ... dumb as a brick. As for AUM vs hourly vs transactional: if someone wants to screw you, their invoicing strategy isn't going to make a lick of difference.

That's not the norm, though. Most of the other professionals I've become close with over the years are high achievers who really want to be the smartest person in the room and who absolutely care and want to help people. That's one end of the bell curve, and those people are worth their weight in gold. They know more than you do (and you, non-OP). The rest aren't necessarily bad actors (yes, those exist on the other end, as they do in *every single profession*), but you might have a harder time justifying the cost and might want to scrutinize that cost a bit further.

So no, they're not that bad, but don't be an idiot and blindly trust just anyone. Interview, ask fair questions (""are you a fiduciary,"" ""what is your process"", ""how much does it cost"", ""how do you keep abreast of changes"", ""based on what I've shared with you do you think this will be worth it *for both of us*"", etc.). Don't be a dick and think you're going in there smarter than everyone else; someone who is good can be as selective as you in who they take on, and no one wants to work with the know-it-all millennial. Make a judgement call. Everyone else's experience is likely either from Googling the question or an anecdotal one-off.",2021-12-03 20:18:16

ChickenSpawner,"I agree with you on pretty much all of your points.

 I know finance right now is a sketchy thing (like most jobs), which is why I'm going in a quantitative direction. All about programming algorithms and comprising huge statistical analyses of data, the programming language we use is somewhat similar to Python. Also very easily transferrable to other fields of Data science. I know it is sort of the culprit behind a lot of disruptive moments going on, but I figure getting ahead of the curve is the best thing I can do as of now. 

I am also 100% with you from the philosophical standpoint - the materialistic world view is a world moot of purpose and from that point of view we really are meat machines. If dead matter is what produces our conscience then we really have no point in living! I find it deeply saddening how that paradigm is actually the dominating worldview at least in our part of the world. The only reason I'm going in the quantitative finance direction is to be able to put myself in a position of full economic independence as fast as possible and because I have a very analytic mind in general, and I believe I can excel in these mathematical fields compared to most of my classmates. However, I truly believe living in the moment and expressing our existence through movement and meditation is the true key to experiencing the joys of life. 

I do a range of stuff from weightlifting to climbing to surfing and martial arts, yoga and meditation and I spend a lot of time just experiencing life, trying to express whatever the conscious drive of our souls are in whatever form I can.

Some people feel they need $1500 in excess cash monthly, others feel they can get by with $200. Commenters also ignore that each person's risk tolerance is different. Not everyone needs to have a large emergency savings fund on the front end of the risk curve, particularly if they're very young in life. Further, you've grounded your housing costs into fixed costs, while your career and income are on an upward trajectory. Most people who purchase a property - particularly their first - have tight finances for the first year or two and it all gets much easier thereafter.

boneywankenobi,"Love this response!  Some notes on it from my perspective:

1) Hadn't seen the Pelican release, it is something that could bring a lot of consistency to certain sectors.  They say operational in 2023, but is that the full fleet or just the first satellites?  I'd say this won't really change their revenue forecast meaningfully until at least 2024-5.  Also, one big thing is most people and companies don't understand SAR.  It's not super intuitive so there will have to be reliance on vendors or the fusion product.  I imagine this will slow revenue growth because the users will need the derivative product rather than the raw more often than not.  I worked with SAR data for about 6 years and while there is power in that data - it does take specific expertise.  TLDR: Overall love to see them doing that, just going to take a while for it to really pay off.

2) Specifically, my work was years before that post and the company has some strong IP in that area.  The reason Planet cared was because we started working with them relatively early (~2016) and they were very invested in finding use cases for their data.  So since we went across sectors (finance, energy, ag, and commodities) it was an opportunity for them to expand their customer base.  Hell, Planet Money even did a podcast series and we were featured (my own part did not air, though I did all the technical research).  The reason it mattered though is because we were trying to do as close to real time measurements of the oil tanks as possible, so one time imagery didn't matter - it was new imagery we needed.  If Planet had done the analytics though, it wouldn't have been nearly as useful since our moat would be greatly reduced.  

Of note from that TDS piece - this is one instance where blind machine learning is kinda dumb.  We know the locations of all the oil tanks, so having an AI find them is pointless (especially with geotagged sat imagery).  And training an AI to get the roof measurements still isn't as good as what I built years ago (&gt;97% accurate) using a more bespoke method that was still quicker than having to label thousands of images.

3) Spatial resolution will be a bigger problem than temporal, and that is legally limited to 25cm right now.... so there isn't a good way around it.  Still room for improvement with Planet however!  The issue though falls into what use cases need frequent, current, and medium resolution imagery.  Tons of use cases can use data from MODIS for instance for free!  For instance, since ag is often done in such large areas, the low resolution imagery is just fine and has been around for a long time.  It will take years to collect enough ground truth data to monitor patterns with the higher resolution data.  Google gives plenty of access to high resolution data that may be a bit stale but not so stale that it's not useful for tons of those applications.  For Planet, one issue is if you need to look at a large scale (say country) the data is very prohibitively expensive for widespread or non-profit use.  Most use cases they have are very small and relatively cheap - but they also don't produce a ton of value for the end user.  We tried to work with customers to enable them to get ahead of the curve.... but there just weren't many opportunities out there to do so.  And that is the heart of my bear thesis.  Sure you can think of 100 possibilities, but I haven't seen the actual prospective users be interested in any meaningful scale.

4) So this depends on how large of swaths of land you want to analyze.  MODIS is better for the very large areas since it has much better spectral resolution and... well it's free with lots of historical data.  Drones aren't for everything, but I can guarantee you almost no company will want to monitor their own construction
with satellites - resolution just isn't good enough.  For ag sure, NVDI is trivial and has been for decades.  But again - free data for large areas.  The ag companies just weren't interested when we talked with them a few years ago.  

5) So Google maps is a great example of why there isn't huge demand actually - it's free.  If you are okay with 6 months of lag (which for pretty much any exploratory project is fine) then there is no reason to buy Planet imagery.  Could other mapping companies enter the space?  Sure, but Google Maps is so dominant with open source tools and free.... how would they thrive?  

6) Hadn't actually seen that to be honest - so that's cool!  There have been other tasking companies out there for a while (Maxar, Airbus being the biggies) so curious how they stack up on pricing.  Likely cheaper but worse resolution (since the others have 30cm now) - though that is not necessarily bad.  

7) And this is why I hope my bearish thesis doesn't work out :)  I'm not anti-Planet, more want to inject some sanity back into the market after the DMY leadership calling it 'Google in 2001' - they are hyping the company so much and my concern is not that it's a *bad* company, rather their projections and hype are quite over the top.  So I legit hope I'm wrong because a lot of good can come from this imagery.  While I have a bear thesis - I don't have any positions in the stock.  May take out some small short swing positions before earnings (just can't see how they'll meet their projections) but that's about all I plan on doing. 

It all comes from having a first hand perspective of the market demand, being deep in the tech, and not how they will suddenly increase CAGR after merger.  But best of luck!  Hope I'm wrong!",2021-12-05 06:24:45

evildata,"It might not be what you’re looking for, but I’ve been where you are in terms of depression, living in my head, and just wanting this fresh start. 

Here’s some practical steps that can help:

1. Figure out your Myers-Briggs type, you can try a free test from 16personalities, truity, mindtools
The reason - it’s for general guidance on your strengths, motivations, weaknesses. Don’t take it literally though. It’s nice though because it provides more than just a number on a bell curve like an IQ test. Also, don’t sign up for anything, just make note of your four letters then check out the profile of that type on the websites then the subreddit.

2. Take the mynextmove career test: https://www.mynextmove.org/explore/ip
It is the BEST test I’ve ever taken that ends up matching exactly what folks were doing. The cool thing is that it splits the careers by education and preparation needed. So you get a full range of careers depending on your own level of effort, no matter your IQ

3. Use both to decide on some things that interest you. The more specialized, the better. If you’re an expert in a specific tool for example, it doesn’t matter what your IQ is, you’ll feel pretty smart when you fix someone else’s problem or have to explain something to a person with no idea. At the end of the day, that’s what you really want from a high IQ, to feel smart. Everything else is based on targeted effort. Don’t try to learn everything, learn one or two things really really well. 

4. There are 3 sources of happiness:

Pleasure - this is fleeting but also the easiest to obtain, examples include having your favorite meal, playing a game with friends, watching a movie that makes you laugh

Mastery - lasts longer as it is related to the feeling of getting better at things. It’s the idea of “flow” where you are so into whatever you’re doing that you forget about time

Purpose - this is the most sustainable source of happiness. If the work you were doing directly reflects your values and the things you care about, no matter how hard your day to day is, you’ll feel this deep sense of contentment since you’ll be proud of yourself and the work you do. So if you love animals and you work at an animal shelter, or you care about the environment so you become a wind turbine tech, or you care about the homeless so you work for habitat for humanity. 


5. Get your finances in order, if you’re living paycheck to paycheck or in debt, you’ll always feel like you’re on the back foot. Check out the leanfire, personal finance, and povertyfinance to give you some good ideas for your situation

I hope this helps and validates your experience as a real thing that happens to people of all IQs. It has way more to do with resources than true inherent intelligence (I’m sure some rich kid with private tutoring would get a higher IQ that doesn’t reflect their true standing)",2021-12-06 04:11:43
Revanchist1,"**The Curve Wars**


**The Battle For High TVL**

DeFi protocols live and die by their Total Value Locked (TVL). The first great war for TVL was the battle of Uniswap and Sushiswap. DeFi summer saw the a plethora of DeFi protocols being launched.  When ChefNomi forked Uniswap to create Sushiswap - they had to incentivize users to deposit their funds on a new platform. After all, an AMM with low TVL will be inefficient for large volume traders trying to swap between coins without high slippage. Sushiswap - which aimed to be a community governed Automatic Market Maker - first incentivized users to stake LP positions from Uniswap on the platform to earn Sushi Tokens. This was done via Liquidity Mining. First used by IDEX (2017) in a very primitive form, then refined in DeFi summer with Synthetix and Compound (2020). After Sushiswap gained enough liquidity, history was made. This was the first time in DeFi History (and in finance history) where a vampire attack was carried to such a large degree. In the space of a week **$1 Billion** was siphoned from Uniswap and into SushiSwap. The Uniswap team could do nothing but watch as Sushiswap took users, liquidity, and trading volume away from their platform. This inevitably led to Uniswap launching their own governance token - UNI.

**Rules Of The Game**

Players in DeFi win by attracting liquidity via offering better yields for users

**Stability In The Curve**

Curve is an AMM for Stablecoins and helps maintain the 1:1 Peg. It is a major building block underpinning all of DeFi. 

*Side note: Curve v2 is aiming to compete with Uniswap and other AMMs.* 

Launched on August 13, 2020 - Curve incentives users depositing stablecoins via liquidity mining of CRV tokens. 

**CRV** can be locked to received **vote escrowed Curve** **(veCRV)** tokens.

veCRV is used to vote in the CurveDAO in return they get boosted rewards from LPing into pools, trading fees from pools, and other things. The important one is having a say in the gauge weight - or how much of the newly minted CRV is distributed to each pool.

Because of how important Curve is to the ecosystem, owning Curve is extremely important for DAOs. 



Curve Docs - 
https://resources.curve.fi/

**Key takeaway: Owning veCRV boosts your yield.**

If a new project is launching a stablecoin, having a say where Curve rewards go will help bootstrap your projects TVL/Liquidity.


**Yearn and the Andre's Foresight**

Yearn Finance was an early user of CRV and player in the Curve War. Yearn launched the backscratcher vault in November of 2020 - a one way vault allowing users to lock curve in exchange for yearn vote escrowed Curve (**yveCRV**). yveCRV gave better yields for users compared to the the regular veCRV so it naturally began accumulating a higher value of locked CRV tokens.


Yearn would then use the veCRV gained to vote in the CurveDAO to boost the incentives given to Yearn's Pools. A positive feedback loop giving Yearn better incentives for users and more Curve tokens.**The Yearn Backscrather vault resulted in a higher TVL**


**In Comes Convex**

As always read the docs for better understanding:

https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/why-convex

Convex allows users to receive the boosted rewards of staking in Curve without locking up/owning any CRV tokens. It accumuklated so much CRV that it overtook Yearns position in just 14 days.

Convex also allows users to instead stake their CRV tokens and recieve a liquid version of veCRV - the Convex Curve Token (**cvxCRV**). 

Since Convex is also a DAO, they also have a voting locked token, vote locked Convex (**vlCVX**) which allows holders to dictate which way the DAO uses its veCRV to vote.


**Bribing**

August of 2021 - After seeing how successful curve rewards were for getting liquidity, Andre Cronje released a platform to bribe veCRV holders to vote certain ways. For example, veCRV owners who vote for Abracadabra will receive a bonus paid out in Spell.

But it gets deeper.

Similar to Bribes, Convex has Votium.

Votium Docs - 
https://docs.votium.app/

Which allows Governance Tokens/DAOs to bribe vlCVX holders to vote a certain way.


**How It Works In Practice**

Look no further than Frax and their fractional-algorithmic stablecoin pools and Abracadabra's MIM. Without increasing their budgets they were able to increase their liquidity compared to the simple direct liquidity mining incentives.


https://twitter.com/crypto_condom/status/1463589085486923778?s=20

&gt;fraxfinance has allocated $839M to the $CRV ecosystem. 
The $2m bribe $FRAX paid to Votium gets paid to voters who vote for their pool. Since FRAX uses their own vlCVX to vote for the FRAX pool, they earn their bribe back + $5 of CRV/CVX rewards for every $1 of bribe spent.



*Sidenote:[ MakerDao has actually started implementing certain aspects of Frax for DAI.](https://twitter.com/samkazemian/status/1455616788050296833?s=20)* It's interesting to see how the builders of DeFi work together to create a better ecosystem. 

**Future of The Curve Wars**

It's not really a Curve War anymore. Yearn and its competitor, StakeDAO, have since conceded to Convex. Yearn recently began delegating its veCRV to convex to achieve higher yields.

However since the DeFi 2.0 system has emerged this year. Tokemak uses a similar mechanism to Curve. Owners of Tokemak token are able to direct liquidity to different pools. 

TOKE may play a big part in getting Liquidity for new Tokens.

[Here is an interesting post from the Tokemak Team regarding the future of DAOs](https://medium.com/tokemak/the-evolution-of-daos-1692509bbb41)


The Idea of ""Protocol Owned Liquidity"" is a massive leap forward in Dao Tokenomics and was pioneered by OlympusDAO. They have already entered the Curve War battlefield by accepting CVX in exchange for OHM Bonds and are launching a new Branch - Redacted Cartel - in order to get a larger CRV ownership.

[A podcast with 0xSami concerning a new branch of OlympusDao - RedactedCartel.](https://rss.com/podcasts/agorapod/333233/)



**Value of Liquidity Directing Tokens**

CRV, CVX, and TOKE, are all important in the DeFi ecosystem. It's obvious that DAOs owning these tokens will be important in the future. And DeFi 2.0, for the most part, seems to be concerned with the interactions between DAOs as opposed to regular folks. 

I just thought it would be interesting to give a little post about the developments of **The Curve War** and who the future players may be.",2021-12-06 06:43:58

RossLedehrman,"Hi, 

Not sure if you are from a US or UK background but ESG financing (or anything around it, risk, modelling) is in its baby steps. And jobs (all areas) are widely acceptable and hiring. 

My first two thoughts are the following;

1) regulators will impose ESG related risk on banks who impose systemic risk to the economy. This is a fact, i'm not pulling this out of my ass. 

You can already fully read up on all this information regulators are thinking/imposing on banks such as the following;

[https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/climate-change](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/climate-change)

2) in the meantime - banks are aware that 'new environmental metrics' will be imposed - and they are currently modelling potential metrics that could assist the regulator for a more homogenous approach when they compare ESG like-for-like comparing. For example - I am working on a machine learning algorithm that predicts c02 emissions per country on a daily basis - to ensure that liquidity management (funding/financing) remains 'as green' as possible - as long term structured finance (the government bonds) from X country are nothing else but a 'loan' to a country who perhaps might not be so good with the environment than country Y. If so - a metric can be imposed and as bank you can switch your bond from X to Y. This to ensure that you as firm/bank/whatever 'remain as green' as possible - while ensuring that 'risk' is not impaired. 

A lot of this information is already anticipated in #2022, especially for ICAAP related roles. 

So tl;dr

1) regulators

2) banks

have plenty of ESG related roles (from risk, modelling, financing, etc) 

there is plenty of neutral, unbiased information on these websites (ignore the wide internet, go to the source, the bank or the regulators) and read about this

and start applying. You'll be ahead of the curve.

I've been in banking (on and off0 for over 20 years, and ESG is literally in its infancy. 

Good luck!!!",2021-12-06 23:56:28
chuck_portis,"Bro, they're not ""giving"" anyone anything.  The only way to participate is to invest in EGLD and/or MEX.  If they didn't provide the boosted rewards for liquidity, they would have nobody using the Maiar DEX.  It's not a useful product on its own.  There's tons of DEX'es out there with hundreds of coins, working Bridges, high APR's, on more proven and established networks.

They aren't providing the Boost out of charity.  They are trying to remain competitive with other similar products which are superior in functionality and longevity.  They are showing up with an incomplete product (with bugs to boot) and they managed to attract $2B in TVL.  That's entirely from the Boost.  

It's not like anyone is getting in on the ground floor of $MEX.  It's valued at $2B market cap, which is more than Curve Finance / 1Inch / Compound.  These are all extremely established projects with huge TVL and longevity.  No sane person would invest in the MEX token at these prices.  That's why people were selling so heavily, because the team was inflating the value of MEX to make the rewards appear higher.

Now you have LKMEX and it's showing you 1000% APR, 3% a day, whatever.  Truth is, these APR's are nonsense if you can't sell the token.",2021-12-07 04:36:48
AZComrade420,"I can't find a job because I have no references from the past 5 years.  I was fired from my last two jobs during the pandemic and before that I broke contract as an educator by leaving mid-school-year due to my health after having been in the profession about 3 and a half years.

I left public education because I couldn't handle the pressure of being evaluated as an effective teacher when my classroom was dangerously underfunded (no fire extinguisher in the science lab with students with school records of starting fires!). My students were facing poverty at best and homelessness at worst and I was making less money as a certified teacher than I did as a long term substitute in another school district. My health declined and I left the profession.  I found work as a math instructor and eventually became the center director of the tutoring center.  I was in the job for roughly a year and a half. Then COVID-19 hit.

I started wearing a mask and gloves and implemented sanitization procedures without previous direction and anxiously awaited the shutdown and the ""13 Days to Flatten the Curve.""  As someone who taught children the importance of the ability to read a graph I was sincerely hoping we were going to take this seriously.

Somehow we were deemed ""essential workers"" despite all other educational facilities being closed at the time. We tried transitioning to online tutoring but the internet was too unstable at my location (even though I had been complaining about spotty internet since I had accepted the promotion the year before).  I was asked to integrate with another tutoring center on the other side of town so I was no longer able to walk to work. The tutoring center was crowded with more employees than the CDC was allowing at a time and my boss and the other center directors were not only not wearing masks but were telling our tutors not to wear masks ""as it makes it difficult to hear and the children can't see you smiling."" The panic attacks came back.

On my day off they told me to go wait for the Cox guy who was going to fix the internet at my center.  They showed up and fired me for my job performance.  A year and a half of work experience gone because the uneducated small business tyrant who owned the math center didn't want to follow CDC guidelines.  
I left education during the pandemic and headed for the ""green rush"" at new shop was opening and was biking distance from my home.  As we were an alternative health facility serving immunocompromised patients I felt comfortable with the procedures and precautions and we were reassured that the COVID-19 protections would be implemented ""until the end of the pandemic."" These company policies lasted through the end of the year.  They also stated they would notify employees if someone on your shift was exposed to COVID-19 for the purposes of contact tracing and testing.  This wasn't the only thing they lied about.

We were promised performance pay and evaluations by the CEO during orientation for our $1M/90day goal which we never received despite earning roughly $1.6M in the first three months. When we were acquired by a new company for roughly $85M and we started receiving company emails from our new corporate offices located on the 27th floor of the IBM building on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, I made a remark to my coworkers about I felt like a worthless idiot working for a bunch of MadMen who all think they're so smart and successful because they get away with lying about sales goals and paying their workers minimum wage (despite the majority of us having college degrees!!).  Despite gaining roughly a year of experience in customer service, cash handling, sales, inventory management, as well as state compliance at a job that requires you to be ""highly proficient"" in math (pun intended), my $500,000 in sales in 10 months counts for nothing.

I figured with my customer service, cash handling, and compliance experience I could start working in banking or finance (I know, I know, I'm philosophically dead, please don't hurt me) but because of my employment record I cannot find a work that will cover my house payment.

I was thinking of going back to graduate school for yet another worthless degree that I will once again fail to monetize and will provide me absolutely zero return on investment, but jokes on me because I don't even have three professional references at this point.",2021-12-07 06:06:23
slumberpartysis1,"Pros:
Mental health
Freedom to work a lot or not at all
No shitty co-workers or bosses
Making your own schedule
Everyday is technically different so it's not repetitive per se
You can spend time learning things while driving and in between orders.


Cons
Sitting for long periods of time
More likely to get in to an accident and die
Pay fluctuates even if you work a lot
?wear and tear?


Tips for anyone looking at this for full time work. 

Treat it like it's a company. Not like a job. You have no job security. If your company stops getting orders or you are a bad business. You will go out of business. 

Test out your area for at least two weeks to make sure it's worth it before quitting your job. I suggest a month

You need to save constantly. Just because you can have your pay any day you want doesn't mean you need to spend it. 

DO NOT. Finance or do this seriously in a financed vehicle. If you don't have a junk car and only have a financed vehicle save until you can afford a junker. There is 0 reason to have a nice car for delivering food.better gas mileage is a perk but people don't understand it plateaus at a certain point. If you finance a great car. your gas savings WILL NOT out perform the amount of money depreciation is going to make you lose. I put ? Around wear and tear because it does matter as a con but not nearly as much when you can fix a junker with YouTube and the car is at the end of its depreciation curve.

Learn how to make simple repairs. Brakes and rotors. Spark plugs. Coils. Valve cover gasket. Just simple things. 

If you struggle in normal work environments like I do. Delivering food might be a good alternative. It's helped immensely with my mental health. 

Sign up for all the apps (ue GH DD). Never just rely on one. If something happens to your DD account you always have a back up GH or something

RLutz,"There's already so many replies here that I think I'm probably wasting my time, but I did want to give my two cents as someone who has an extensive background in traditional software engineering but has recently moved into the Blockchain space. Some background on me, professionally, I've spent the last decade or so working for a bunch of different Fortune top 50 companies, I started my own consulting business, primarily solving interesting problems with what is now considered more traditional distributed microservices. Not to brag, but most of the times I would go join a new team, or consult at a new company, it was immediately clear that I was one of, if not the strongest engineer on the team. Granted, these weren't FAANG companies, but I did work for multiple top 50 companies in the US.

Today, I work for a Blockchain company filled with former FAANG engineers. For the first time in my career of 13+ years, I feel maybe slightly above average at best. I went into this place thinking crypto was an interesting novelty; one that I've dabbled in over the past 6 years or so doing a bit of mining, bit of investing, but mostly I thought it was just that, an interesting novelty. My thoughts on the currency aspect of Blockchain are actually largely unchanged. A deflationary currency is a bad currency, though it is possible that it makes a decent store of wealth for folks in places where it's difficult to accrue wealth.

That said, it is now my opinion, and the opinion of a lot of the former Google/Amazon engineers I work with, that although the currency aspect is what is currently keeping the lights on, that Blockchain itself is about to change the world. The folks who *really* understand Blockchain don't care that much about the currency aspect of the game but are entirely convinced that things like DeFi are about to completely change the world, and after two months or so working here, I am convinced as well--and I'm not some insufferable crypto bro, I'm a dude that just wrote business software.

Imagine a world where you don't need banks to give loans. A world where you don't need Wall St to engage in stock trade. A world where the traditional mortgage industry is made largely irrelevant. [This is the world that DeFi promises.](https://defieducation.substack.com/p/decentralized-finance-the-high-level)

If I had to summarize my Blockchain journey so far it would be like this. Originally, I thought cryptocurrency was a novel pseudo-Ponzi scheme and that Blockchain had a few very niche applications where it might actually be useful. Today, my view is that the currency aspect of Blockchain is largely a ""who cares?"" sort of thing. I liken Blockchain to the creation of ARPANET. Bitcoin was just the first step, essentially laying the foundation, similar to ARPANET, and now the things being built on top of it are akin to Amazon.com--you couldn't have hoped to build something like Amazon without the invention of the foundational Internet technology, and similarly, you couldn't have built up DeFi platforms that allow for loans without banks, stock trades without Wall St, and easy IPO's for everyone without Blockchain. There is a real power in being able to run code on a decentralized Blockchain where no one can alter your code and everyone agrees on what has happened and what the outcome should be (smart contracts).

I guess I'll leave you with this. There were folks when I was a kid saying the Internet was a stupid novelty. Those people, in retrospect, should have invested, or at the least, should have learned more about the Internet, because **eventually they had no choice but to utilize it.** I now fully believe Web 3 is the same. You might as well learn about it and get ahead of the curve because at some point in the near to distant future you will have no choice but to interact with it. NFT's are a meme, cryptocurrency is currently at best a way to store wealth, but DeFi and smart contracts will fundamentally change the world.",2021-12-07 22:05:08

hakapes,"Encouraging, thanks for the info and the time. I am happy to follow up with the linked guides, good homework for the rest of the week.

I staked coins both in the CDC App for the card (180 days), Earn (90 days), in the DeFi Wallet (28 days unbonding) and in the Exchange to optimise a bit the fees (180 days).

In all fairness, for a newcomer like me, the journey is quite a steep learning curve.

I started with the CDC Visa Card.

Learning the app was a stretch. I remember when I googled Fiat, and started to understand what is going on and how.

Then I learned the CDC Exchange, look into fees, convert to USDC first in the app and then buy CRO in the exchange. Now I make limit orders to optimise the cost.

After 3-4 months, finally I started to use the CDC Defi Wallet. 

Then in the Defi Wallet, using dApps was again a stretch. I got as far as the VVS vaults.

Because Beefy is there, after a week or two, I decided to look into Beefy.

Now, Crystl Finance is another hop.

no-nonsense-crypto,"This isn't the first time a project has tried basically this method, and I'm not convinced it actually is all that great. There are a few problems with it:

1. People holding $PNG are just hangers-on providing no value to this system. I guess that's great if you're a $PNG holder, but if you're a user of the Pangolin trading platform, you've gotta ask yourself, why am I paying a fee to these random people who aren't giving me anything? As a trader, paying a fee to the liquidity provider makes sense, but paying a fee to the $PNG stakers? Why?
2. Okay, so let's say I decide to be a $PNG holder. Why should I have to stake to receive benefits? Does anyone actually benefit if I stake, rather than just holding $PNG? What's the purpose? You can argue that staking makes the implementation of the distribution easier, but there's an even easier way: just burn the coins you bought back. It works like this: Let's say there are 1million of a coin (let's call it CCC) with a market cap of $1 million, so each coin is worth one dollar, and you have 100,000 of that coin you want to distribute to holders. A holder with 200,000CCC will receive 22,222CCC from the 100,000CCC you're distributing, so their total value is now 222,222CCC, which is worth $222,222. If, instead, you just burn the 100,000CCC, the market cap stays the same, so the value of the coin goes up: the person with 200,000CCC now has 200,000/900,000 of the market cap insteead of 200,000/1million of the market cap, so their coins are now worth $1.1111111 each, so their total value is now $222,222. The point is, burning is a much simpler mechanism, that distributes to all holders. Of course, if you want to incentivize staking, distributing the coins to stakers and excluding holders who don't stake is different from burning. But... why do we want to do that? Stakers aren't contributing anything more than other holders, so why do they deserve more?
3. Buying back and distributing profits creates buy pressure, but there's a good chance that it just creates just as much sell pressure. If I have 100 $PNG staked, and I get 10 $PNG in staking rewards each month, what's stopping me from just treating those rewards as income and selling them immediately? Some percentage of users will always do this. Of course, if you burn instead of distributing buybacks, users can effectively do the same thing by calculating out a dollar-cost-average sell each month, but that's harder to calculate and fewer users will do it, in theory.

This isn't hypothetical at this point: [Sushi](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sushi) and [QuickSwap](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/quickswap) has exactly the same mechanism for staking SUSHI as xSUSHI and QUICK as dQUICK, and if you calculate it out, both coins' price have deteriorated enough that you've lost money since the ATH, even if you include staking rewards. [Beefy](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/beefy-finance) has a similar mechanism, with the same result. I think at this point we can conclusively say that this mechanism doesn't work.

More fundamentally for exchanges like Sushi, QuickSwap and Pangolin, there's a basic catch-22 that needs to be solved:

1. On the one hand, if you don't give competitive rewards for providing liquidity to important pairs, liquidity providers will go elsewhere, and traders will follow since they need the liquidity.
2. On the other hand, if the only means you have of giving competitive rewards for providing liquidity is continuously minting a coin and giving it out to farmers, your coin will be diluted, and lose value. Ultimately this will result in you not being able to give competitive rewards.

Ultimately, this is a sustainability issue: none of the major AMMs have figured out a way to break this cycle. Curve might seem like an exception because the 4-year lock on CRV as veCRV is demonstrably causing people to lock up CRV, but this is only really a delay tactic. Without giving away too much information, I think that DFYN does have a solution which they haven't shared publicly yet (and I'm not going to share it either).",2021-12-08 01:12:31
deong,"Here's the thing you're missing. At a large company, jobs don't get posted by having the hiring manager write up a description and post in on the web site.

When I want to hire someone, my first step is to fill out a requisition form for our Talent Acquisition group. That form has several standard canned text options that could basically describe anything between ""janitor"" and ""chief marketing officer"". Think of how many jobs you've seen that say you might need to occasionally lift up to 10 pounds.

That form also contains a set of titles and corresponding pay grades that I can choose from. Am I hiring a Data Engineer or a Software Engineer? Is it a Senior Data Engineer or a Lead Data Engineer? Each of those titles has a document that describes the typical skills and experience needed as well as what the responsibilities of the job are. Those descriptions have been written by 40 people over the course of a year in meeting after meeting after meeting with the goal that HR can look across other companies of similar sizes, in similar industries, in your geographical area, etc., to calibrate salary ranges so that they know they're paying competitive wages in accordance with their hiring goals. 

I, as a director, care very little about any of that. I have a team that is down a person, and I want to find the best person I can to make my team as strong as possible. I do have a P&amp;L to manage, so I don't want to pay twice the going rate, but otherwise, I simply don't care if the candidate has 4 years experience in Python or 6. I care that they look like they're a good Python programmer that I can hire within my budget. But I'm just operating within that system. I have $X of dollars I can spend, and that lets me hire a Senior Software Engineer, so that's what I aim for. If I get a great candidate who is way off the experience requirements, I might hire them anyway at a junior level and save some of the money. If I find an amazing candidate who wants more than I can pay, I might go back to my finance team and see if I can find enough extra money to convert my open position to a Lead and offer them that instead.

That's the way everyone should treat job postings. They're a standardized form that is supposed to cover the fat part of the curve. I've never known anyone who used them as a completely prescriptive filter, as in, ""this candidate looks great, but they only have 3 years experience and we want 4"".",2021-12-08 01:58:45
WhatnotSoforth,"I'm currently working on a trading platform for RobinHood using R. Still stuck on the data wrangling stuff, handling tapes has so far been the biggest struggle. I'm writing the method to preferentially pull from a SQLite database, and if the tape does not exist there it will pull from RobinHood and/or from Yahoo with quantmod. This way I can use a generic function with a local cache as speedup, with the added benefit of seamless data pull for things that have not hit the cache yet. Once I finish that I can start on analysis tools, which will help me trade manually. Backtesting comes next, then orders. That pretty much wraps it up, and then I get to write a shiny app for it!

I chose R because it feels much more robust than python, imo. Very much a *""what you expect to happen usually happens the way you think it should""* in such a way that is great for rapid prototyping and first-shot success. Python isn't bad for QF, I just personally don't like it. A skilled python programmer would be miles ahead of me by now.

The learning curve for R is somewhat steep, but it's an insanely powerful language, and it's worth learning how to code in it well because it writes out so generic that you just become a better programmer in general as a side benefit. The best part is that boilerplate code tends to be minimal and the resulting code is therefore very readable and concise. Statements tend to be very ""meaningful.""

M0n0Zer0,"Generally, most, if not all people argue not from a place of logic but from their moral intuitions. Logic and reason can be employed to reinforce moral intuitions and prop up a false sense of legitimacy, because the intuitions are their premises. The danger becomes when you are so convinced your moral intutions are based in reality that you are unable to entertain the idea that you might be wrong.  


The reason why people fail to convince others is because they don't really listen to their opponents or entertain the idea that their own ideas about the world may be incomplete.   


Very few people have actual, factual conversations about topics in which they are well versed to the level of expertise. They take the word of people they trust because they articulate their own intuitions about how the world works.   


Often, people from different political perspectives will have areas in which their sight is clearer than others, even if the rhetoric is allegorical or not literally true - it's possible, for example, that the conspiracy rhetoric of anti-vaxers or QAnon types or David Icke loons can reveal greater truths about the general operation of power if taken not as facts, but as metaphors.   


It's easy to see parallels between some of the conspiracies and some of the observations by (Economist and Ex-Greece Finance Minister) Varoufakis about how we've already moved to Techno Feudalism - and how the conspiracists anxieties and fears are ahead of the curve when it comes to seeing how this new paradigm is affecting us. 

This doesn't mean accepting what a conspiracist (or a right wing ideologue or a class-first socialist or anyone who thinks differently to you) says, but it does mean interrogating it to see if it's a symptom of something that you haven't yet considered.

If your primed to reject everything they say then your own view of reality may be stymied.   


We're living through a time of widespread mistrust of political institutions and our knowledge generating systems. The political tribes are symptoms of the breakdown of economic, social and political systems. We need to rebuild that trust - and that will never come from monstering. The more social trust we have with each other the less space there is for extremism and hate.  


We have to have conversations, not with the primary motive of changing other people's minds (although this can happen), but challenging our own beliefs and testing where we're right and where we're wrong.",2021-12-08 06:27:55

&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;  The astounding yet true rags-to-riches saga of a homeless father who raised and cared for his son on the mean streets of San Francisco and went on to become a crown prince of Wall Street
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;At the age of twenty, Milwaukee native Chris Gardner, just out of the Navy, arrived in San Francisco to pursue a promising career in medicine. Considered a prodigy in scientific research, he surprised everyone and himself by setting his sights on the competitive world of high finance. Yet no sooner had he landed an entry-level position at a prestigious firm than Gardner found himself caught in a web of incredibly challenging circumstances that left him as part of the city's working homeless and with a toddler son. Motivated by the promise he made to himself as a fatherless child to never abandon his own children, the two spent almost a year moving among shelters, ""HO-tels,"" soup lines, and even sleeping in the public restroom of a subway station.
&gt;
&gt;Never giving in to despair, Gardner made an astonishing transformation from being part of the city's invisible poor to being a powerful player in its financial district.
&gt;
&gt;More than a memoir of Gardner's financial success, this is the story of a man who breaks his own family's cycle of men abandoning their children. Mythic, triumphant, and unstintingly honest, The Pursuit of Happyness conjures heroes like Horatio Alger and Antwone Fisher, and appeals to the very essence of the American Dream.

^(By: Will Smith, Mark Manson | 418 pages | Published: 2021 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, biography, memoir, nonfiction, audiobooks | )[^(Search ""will by WILL smith"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=will by WILL smith&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;One of the most dynamic and globally recognized entertainment forces of our time opens up fully about his life, in a brave and inspiring book that traces his learning curve to a place where outer success, inner happiness, and human connection are aligned. Along the way, Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had.
&gt;
&gt;Will Smith’s transformation from a fearful child in a tense West Philadelphia home to one of the biggest rap stars of his era and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, with a string of box office successes that will likely never be broken, is an epic tale of inner transformation and outer triumph, and Will tells it astonishingly well. But it's only half the story. 
&gt; 
&gt;Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over. 
&gt; 
&gt;This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one person mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home. The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life story that is preposterously entertaining, even astonishing, puts Will the book, like its author, in a category by itself.
&gt; 
&gt;“It’s easy to maneuver the material world once you have conquered your own mind. I believe that. Once you've learned the terrain of your own mind, every experience, every emotion, every circumstance, whether positive or negative, simply propels you forward, to greater growth and greater experience. That is true will. To move forward in spite of anything. And to move forward in a way that brings others with you, rather than leave them behind.” —Will Smith

DukenottheDuke,"Honestly a CFA wouldn't help you much when you are fresh off the university because this certificate requires finance working experience to obtain, not just passing 3 exams. If you ask me, I would say don't let CFA outweigh your opportunities to get work experience while still at the university. In finance industry your previous job experience always prevails.

However, CFA starts to matter once you have 3-4 years of work experience because that's when you're actually qualified as a CFA given you have passed the 3 exams. I haven't reached there but I know from where I come from, this is the fact. But don't let the fact that you won't be a CFA until 3-4 years later disappoint you, because in my country many companies specifically write in their recruitment descriptions that students who passed level 1 CFA exam are preferred (for internship opportunities).

Regarding business management or finance, trust me this is totally up to your personal preference. The reason I take it this way is because in finance, although some jobs look really really really fancy, you'd literally neck yourself if you're not up to the long hours and heavy stress. However, do notice that the finance industry is so broad and jobs included can be anywhere from big 4 to blackstone, you need to figure out which specific role you'd like to play. An auditor? An investment banker? Or a fund manager? These are all finance jobs but they require very different skills/qualifications. To be honest, from my personal understanding, a CPA could be more helpful than you'd think. I'm not saying CFA is bad and you should contribute your every effort to get a CFA, but don't underestimate the role of a CPA and it's not just for big 4 jobs. I was applying for jobs as an analyst in investment banks, and apparently they have an appetite to CPA holders/exam takers, which surprised me because I thought CFA is the only certificate they're after.

All that said, if I were you I would find a piece of paper and write down what I would want out of a job, for instance good reputation? The ability to afford high end suits? Steep learning curve? Work-life balance? Or capability to use what you have at job for your dad's family business? After that research on different jobs in finance and try to match your perspective job outcome to these job descriptions. However, if you are genuinely interested in investment, don't let CPA slip off from your eyesight, sometimes it's more helpful than you think.",2021-12-09 15:26:13

yaboynib,"To preface: the risk is that this is DeFi. Human error means that you can lose almost everything if you are not careful. I would highly recommend a hardware wallet and get yourself familiar with it. That will be your safest option in the long run.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, you have options! I would suggest splitting up your 'eggs' so they're not all in one basket. As others have suggested , you could put a portion of your networth into Terras Anchor protocol for \~20% on stable coins. 

You could also try out the [aTriCrypto3 pool on Curve Finance](https://polygon.curve.fi/atricrypto3) \[on the polygon network\], which is a liquidity pool consisting of 33% stable coins (10.9% DAI, 16.14% USDC, USDT 6.39%), BTC 33.31%, and ETH 33.26%. This could be a good option to mitigate risk of volatility, while still getting exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is currently netting 4.56 variable APR, and 18.44% rewards in curve. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another option is [OlympusDAO](https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/stake) \[Ethereum mainnet, but also you can get gOHM\]. They are aiming to become the decentralized reserve currency of DeFi (across all chains). In the long run purchasing OHM and staking it (This is called (3,3) and is based on Game Theory) is meant to make your income grow over time. If the price drops, the high APY and daily rebasing is meant to offset any sort of price loss. In theory, by participating in (3,3) , and being there for the long run - you are meant to only be in the Green. I highly suggest reading through their site (here you go! [https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/)) , and seeing what they have to offer. The passive compounding strategy might be what you're looking for. There's so much more to say, but I dont want to slam you with a huge wall of text. 

There's so much more in the world of DeFi. Good luck!",2021-12-09 22:13:09

Revanchist1,"A major part of Yield Farming is Governance tokens. For the most part, High Yield in DeFi is achieved through the farming of these governance tokens and the hope that they increase in value. The tokens are given out as incentives for using the platform and providing liquidity. 


The 'safest' farms are Curve Finance, Convex, or Yearn. They all rely on farming the CRV and CVX tokens. You can read about the [Curve Wars here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/r991sy/daily_general_discussion_-_december_5_2021/hnduxae?context=3) for a basic understanding of it. But to summarize owning more CRV and CVX = higher yield for users and more liquidity for stablecoins, so DAOs are trying to own as much as possible.


For an you, individual user, it's real simple. Visit convexfinance or yearn finance and look for a token or LP position you own that you want to earn yield on. And approve the token deposit and then deposit. It's two transactions and because of this you have to do the calculations to figure out if it's worth farming with the amount you want to farm with. More $$$ deposited = Faster you will break even. If you have to spend $300 on tx fees to deposit $1,000 earn an estimated 10% a year ($100) it's not worth it.  


Now we return to the first part of my post. You won't be rewarded in your native currency. The yield is paid out in the platforms governance tokens. And these token prices can go up or down. So the yield is variable and not set in stone.",2021-12-12 07:07:43

Hikingwhiledrinking,"&gt;Blockchain s get hacked, and if they don't, smart contracts do, and if they don't, individual wallets do.  Cold storage is very secure, but currency is meant to move, not stay stagnant.

Billions in fiat is hacked, stolen, extorted every year as well. 

I agree that security has certainly been an issue in crypto from the beginning, but these financial woes can largely be ascribed to the novelty of the technology and a steeper learning curve than traditional financial services. 

1. Blockchains are becoming increasingly resilient to attack. Yes 51% attacks do still happen on occasion, but mostly small Proof-of-Work chains with low hashrates. Verge's attack earlier this year resulted in no funds lost. This is not a problem for most established chains these days.
2. Smart contract audits are way more commonplace, and coding best practices more well-established. This problem may not be fully soluble due to the immutability feature of blockchains, but things are improving substantially.
3. Most wallet breaches are due to phishing scams and owner carelessness. This is the steeper learning curve. Most of us have not been conditioned to have full custodial control over our funds, and most don't fully understand that there's often no centralized authority to whom you can complain to recoup losses. 

Crypto has been a kind of wild west of finance over the last decade, but there's *always* growing pains with new, revolutionary technology.",2021-12-12 10:14:37

unfair_bastard,"To describe such a sea change in views on LGBT issues in the anglophone countries, and throughout parts of Europe as a ""mindset"" is far too simple and seems both protean and monolithic. It is a nuanced issue, the details of which are still being worked out and integrated into that legal tradition I mentioned above. These questions turn primarily, in the US at least, on questions having to do with interpretations of several constitutional amendments as well as the Civil Rights laws of the 1960s, while going into the details in the UK, Canada, etc is beyond the scope of this post, yet relate to similar issues of individual rights, dignity, etc. Generally changes in these views across sections of society in the anglophone countries happen piecemeal and are not viewed as a national mindset, but rather as a mix of individual viewpoints which often prioritize different things. It is more of a patchwork, or a mosaic of often dissonant viewpoints, so viewing it as one mindset would result in a rather schizophrenic mindset if one wants to use that framing. 

It makes even less sense to think of crime this way, especially in a diverse society. There is no ""mindset on crime"", there are many interacting mindsets on crime which produce various emergent effects. A better way to get a sense of something akin to ""mindset"" might be via opinion polling

The US is not #1 in rape, various African countries take the top slots with South Africa usually #1, where in the world are you getting this? Same with murder. You do mean per capita, right? Again, estimates certainly exist, and that is good. Why do you keep dodging the point that China doesn't even give official #s and considers the matter a state secret? When ""quarreling and provoking trouble"" is a crime punishable by years in prison, not knowing how many are in prison for that is troubling. Yes, we can estimate. That is decidedly not the point

""The US government only bails out banks"". Wow. Please do some more history reading. The US government basically bails out every sector of the economy besides consumers fairly regularly. Look up ""airline bailouts"" as just one example. The federal government will write off student debt to save the universities, whom the debt financed educations primarily benefit, as almost all of the debt is owed by students (in the end) to the US dept of education. Barely any private loans are a part of the system. The US govt can trivially forgive the debt, as they are the party owed the money. It is more a political issue, as many (but not all) in the US who paid their tuition would demand some sort of similar payment of equal value as someone having their loans forgiven. Look at the response Elizabeth Warren often gets from parents who paid for their children's university. I find their animosity towards debt forgiveness puzzling, but it is laid out quite clearly. Writing it off would be relatively trivial economically compared to the political difficulty

As for how the economy is not failing, where to begin? Do you have an econ or finance background? You seem to know at least enough to look up frightening looking charts, but I can't tell if this is because you understand the genuine risk that exists there, or because you're simply repeating what someone has shown you or taught to you. I don't mean this to be rude, but merely as to what level to tailor my response. Do let me know what might be best. I'm not going to go through each of your questions in depth because it would take too long, but in short:

M2 has grown terrifically in the last 2 years, mainly in response to the ""liferafting"" of the real economy into the financial system during covid. This is temporary and it is ending. A lot of credit was created, and a lot will have to be destroyed

Inflation is at a multi decade high because of what is in my opinion a major policy error by the Fed, which ended up in quite a difficult situation between fiscal policy errors and foreign policy errors. However, it's nowhere near the worst of the 70s, and not an intractable problem. Wait for the rate hikes. My guess is that you think they'll result in collapse. I do not

So before I go into answering any of your questions on RRP I need to ask if you understand IOER, FFR, their history, changes since the 1980s and 1990s, etc. You're asking a question that requires knowledge of the history of the banking system, and I need to know where to begin in answering your question, as well as how much you understand of how the banking system works (e.g. discount window, time deposits, net margin). You're basically asking, whether you know it or not, how we get out of the negative interest rate trap (that is to say, the Fed, ECB, and BoJ primarily, as the three largest and most leveraged central banks). I think the likeliest way to do this is to goose ECB out of negative rates with a joint and several issuance red bond/blue bond setup as proposed in 2012, combined with swaps of current negative yielding German bonds held by e.g. German insurance companies, for newly issued positive yielding German red bonds along with ECB rate hikes. This would unhook the 30yrBund/Bond arb holding down the long end of the UST curve, allowing for curve re-inversion and for pressure to come off the short end (this is part of what's driving new M2 issuance)

^this is the short answer. The long answer depends on if you understand what Volcker shock did, as well as what Greenspan began in the 1990s",2021-12-13 06:23:29
isheep225,"If I have only one advice to give, it would be to educate yourself before doing anything with this crazy amount of MATIC. But I'll answer your question anyway. 

You got to understand that when people say they are staking MATIC, everybody is not always refering to the same thing. When people say ""stake"", they all think of ""depositing MATIC in order to get a reward"", which can be done by many ways. 

(I will put the links here for people to click if they are interested and if they want to confirm, but, as other have said, I SUGGEST YOU TO NOT CLICK ON ANY LINK ON HERE, EVEN MINE, AS YOU OWN A F\*&amp;?&amp;\* LOT OF MATIC, STAY  SAFE) (I suggest you to make Google Search of everything and click only on the first results you get to reach the above links)

&amp;#x200B;

1. Delegation to a validator

**What it is:** This one is the only ""staking"" you can get with your MATICs. Every other way is a way to get rewards, but not properly staking.

Official staking on Polygon is when you delegate your MATIC to a validator. Validators are people who, well, validate transactions on Polygon. These people accumulate a lot of MATIC from everybody through a smart contract, and then the Polygon protocol gives them randomly the right to validate transaction blocks in exchange of a reward. The randomness of this process is proportional to how many MATIC a validator has staked. To get more chances to be the chosen one and to receive rewards, validator welcome anybody who wants to stake his MATIC to his own pool. Generally, they will take a small fee in exchange of the right they give you to stake with them. As you know, Polygon is an L2 chain. 

**How to**: The validation and staking processes are happening on the Ethereum chain, through a smart contract on Ethereum. What you have to do is put your MATIC onto an Ethereum wallet ([Metamask](https://metamask.io/faqs)'s FAQ is very good to guide you, try it with small amount first to make sure you understand the process. [Coinbase Wallet](https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/sending-and-receiving/how-do-i-move-assets-between-my-coinbase-wallet-and-my-coinbase) may be another option if you want to keep it easy). Make sure to withdraw on the Ethereum chain if asked (Not Polygon chain actually OTHERWISE YOU MAY LOOSE YOUR MATICs). You will also need some ETH (100$ worth maybe), as you will need to pay for the gas fees on Ethereum to make the whole process. You then have to make your wallet interact with a [validation smart contract](https://wallet.polygon.technology/staking) on the official Polygon delegation tool. Then, your token will be transfered and you will get rewards every few minutes. APR is a little over 11% for now, it varies according to the number of MATIC staked, which is 14k MATIC per year.

**PROS:** 

* It is a good APY
* It is pretty transparent
* You really participate to the project itself

**CONS:**

* It happens on the Ethereum blockchain. You got to understand that 11% is the reward you'll get for a year. But you can actually gain a little more if you COMPOUND the reward to get. Compounding means you put the MATIC you get as a reward back into your staking with the smart contract. Which makes your bag bigger and gain more. But as you are on the Ethereum blockchain, and that gas fees are crazy high to access the chain, you will have to pay EVERYTIME you compound, which makes you loose a lot of the interest of compound frequently. It could eat a good chunk of this 14k MATIC reward
* Steep learning curve. Must know what you do at every step so your money remain safe

2. CeFi lending

**What it is**: Many businesses are now proposing to kend them your MATIC in order to receive a reward. It is very much like lending to your bank to get interests on your money. What they do with it varies a lot (they can lend it back to someone else, stake, short MATIC, make DeFi, etc.) and you don't really care in the end. You just lend to a company and they have a contract with you to give you some MATIC at various rates. [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) offers 12%, [Celcius](https://celsius.network/earn-rewards-on-your-crypto) offer 8,99%, [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/1e95e0d5bcf149458ede730dbba7eb75) offers great rate, but with a bonding period (you can't withdraw nomatter what for a fixed period of time), [Nexo](https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-arrives-on-nexo-with-up-to-20-apr-for-matic-holders/) offers 20% and there are probably others I'm not awared of. CeFi means Centralized Finance, as yuo make finance through an actual business.

**How to**: You have first to open an account onto the platform you want to use. Next, you will have to transfer you MATIC tokens to this exchange. When transfering , make sure you use the same chain (either transfering MATIC token from Ethereum chain to Ethereum chain OR from Polygon chain to Polygon chain), OTHERWISE YOU MAY LOOSE YOUR MATICs. From there, the process is straight forward within the app of the platform.

**PROS:** 

* Easier to use
* Easier to understand
* Compounding is usually within the app, no gas fees
* You have some sort of safety because you have client support and legal recourses for many things that could happen

**CONS:** 

* You are supporting centralized exchange, which for many is against the philosophy of crypto
* You don't know what the company is doing with your money (it may be fraud, they may loose it all)
* Your money depends on the their will. If they refuse to let you have your money or if they close without giving your fund back, well, it sucks a lot (pretty much like a normal bank could fail)

isheep225,"3. DeFi lending  
What it is: the whole original idea of crypto is to get rid of bank. DeFi means Decentralized Finance, which is the process of making all sort of financial operation without intermediaries, using on chain technology. The main thing you financial operation you can do to gain some rewards is to lend your tokens on chain. This way, random people will borrow your MATICs in exchange of fees. Aave is the most popular lending platform on Polygon. There you can interact with a smart contract and to lend your coins and earn rewards. Actually, you can even use Aave to lend your MATICs, then borrow more MATICs using your lent MATICs as a collateral in case you can refund what you borrowed, then stake back the lent one to get more rewards. Usually, this process is not profitable, but because Polygon collaborated with Aave to give some more MATICs so it can become more attractive for the users to borrow, you are actually paid to borrow. Without doing the lend/borrow loop, you can earn 4%, which varies from day to day according to demand. With the loop, you can get probably close to 10%There are probably other platforms where you can lend on chain on Polygon, but I am not up to date on this matter. (If you lend on Aave, make sure you keep some MATIC aside to pay for gas fees on the Polygon chain. For instance, Stake 129 999k and keep 1 MATIC to pay when you'll withdraw your tokens)  
How to: First, you will need to get your MATICs on the Polygon chain. First step will be to get a wallet as in step one. From what I know, Coinbase doesn't allow you to withdraw your MATIC on the Polygon chain (only Ethereum chain), and so will need to transfer it either by transfering your tokens to another exchange that support MATICs to Polygon withdrawals (Binance and Crypto.com do). Which would be the cheapest way. Or you withdraw your tokens to Ethereum chain using an Ethereum wallet, then use the official Polygon bridge to transfer from Ethereum to Polygon. Which is way more expensive. Then, you continue on Aave and follow instructinos.   
PROS:  
You have full control on your coins  
Very transparent  
Very liquid. If an Aave alternative appears, you can switch in a matter of minutes with almost no fees  
Very fun to enter the Defi world  
CONS:   
The learning curve of this as steep as the first option  
Rewards are less predictable  
There are other ways of earning rewards. I am thinking of pooling your tokens, leveraging on exchanges, putting into vaults on DeFi services, lending your MATIC on something like QiDAO to use stablecoins to farm, etc. The one I provided are the simplest option and great opportunities to learn. But, please, educate yourself before doing any move; read, watch videos, try with small amounts.",2021-12-13 07:36:45
Haydn31,"Renting an instrument is always a loser. You pay list price plus a whopping finance charge. The entire business is predicated on the idea that the kid’s going to quit so the parents will be able to return it. (How the parents are then motivated to encourage the student during the initial slow learning curve is a mystery.) It’s much better to buy the instrument, pay for it on a credit card which will have a lower interest rate and allow you to pay it off more quickly and pay even less interest. If the student does drop it you can easily sell it on eBay or Craiglist. Used instruments typically sell for about one half to two thirds of the new price.

Same thing with step up or pro horns. Buy from a reputable dealer and finance with a credit card. FYI Trumpets are almost always discounted.

*Disclosure - I currently hold several DEX governance tokens, ~5% of my current portfolio value*

##What are decentralized exchanges and automated market makers?

* (1) Intro: https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-decentralized-exchange-dex

* (2) Vitalik's original Reddit post: https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/55m04x/lets_run_onchain_decentralized_exchanges_the_way/

##DEX caveats

 I'm extremely bullish on [DeFi](https://decrypt.co/resources/defi-ultimate-beginners-guide-decentralized-finance) and believe DEXs specifically hold great promise in terms of: reducing counterparty risk, preserving anonymity and removing barriers to entry for users looking to trade and earn yield. 

That being said, there are some tradeoffs and limitations of interacting with DEXs to be aware of: 

##Yo dawg, I heard you like decentralization    

- Decentralization can refer [to the protocol itself or to the governance and development of the protocol/platform](https://miro.medium.com/max/1304/0*epCTOVyxEmQq-AiU).

- [Decentralization is a spectrum](https://nopara73.medium.com/few-words-on-decentralization-and-anonymous-payments-160782d30b9e) rather than a binary distinction. So a DEX may be [decentralized in some ways but centralized in others](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/07/23/decentralized-exchanges-arent-living-up-to-their-name-and-data-proves-it/). Governance and developer control of a platform, for example, can vary wildly:

    &gt;“Some have large control over their direction, others are governed by venture capital investors, and others have broader communities that vote in changes like an open source project.”
\- [Lex Sokolin, CMO and Global Fintech Co-Head, ConsenSys](https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/why-defi-isn-t-always-as-decentralized-as-you-might-think-7695.htm)

    - Users in the [Uniswap Con Cointest thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og2r4t/rcryptocurrency_cointest_top_10_category_uniswap/) have articulated many of their concerns about whales and VC interests dominating UNI governance politics.

    - But I'll repeat the example of [Uniswap's unilateral decision to delist tokens](https://decrypt.co/76793/ethrereum-dex-uniswap-drops-tokenized-stocks-as-regulators-close-in) after facing regulatory scrutiny from the SEC. Even if a certain protocol is decentralized, the team can take actions to limit access.

    - Similarly, the DeFi community was not too pleased when Compound CEO Robert Leshner [threatened to doxx users](https://decrypt.co/82387/defi-community-blasts-compound-ceo-for-doxxed-comment) who didn't return COMP tokens after a protocol bug.

        - ""Code is law. Unless we fuck up. Then we call the IRS on you."" said [Blockstream CSO Samson Mow](https://nitter.com/Excellion/status/1443875126982840330). 

- Another concern would be seemingly decentralized platforms like Bancor having backdoors and the ability to freeze user funds ([which they did after a hack](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/10/bancor-loses-23-5m/)).

    - [As LTC founder Charlie Lee stated](https://nitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1016499756158234624):

     &gt;""An exchange is not decentralized if it can lose customer funds OR if it can freeze customer funds. Bancor can do BOTH. It's a false sense of decentralization.""

    - [Or, as DOGE founder Jackson Palmer commented](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/the-lessons-learned-from-a-false-sense-of-decentralization-875b8c2731a6):

     &gt;“The key thing here is not the hack itself — it’s the fact the Bancor team had the ability to freeze funds. How many other “decentralized” DApps have a built-in kill switch that’s centrally controlled?”

- In removing gatekeepers and intermediaries, DEXs and AMMs promise a more level financial playing field than the permissioned, opaque system of centralized finance. 

    - However, even when governance of an open source platform is 'fair' and decentralized, DEX users are exposed to some of the same financial fuckery inherent to CeFi, [such as front running](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest/).

    - There is no need for practices like [Robinhood's payment for order flow](https://web.archive.org/web/20210729220645/https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhoods-debut-is-clouded-by-sec-scrutiny-of-payment-for-order-flow-11625655600) when trades are publicly broadcasted for the world to see:

        - ""[Decentralized exchanges make it easier for anyone to exploit temporary market inefficiencies for a profit. In other words, it’s easier to front-run the market](https://blog.gnosis.pm/decentralized-exchanges-have-a-problem-7e6d81d91ba1).""


        - ""[Trades on decentralized exchanges \(DEX\) are sitting ducks while they remain idle in the processing queue. A small cohort of developers can and do take advantage of this lag time between hitting the trade button and the trade executing on-chain by front-running, back-running or 'sandwiching' a transaction.](https://www.yahoo.com/now/bad-sandwich-defi-trader-poisons-153336603.html)""


##With mediocre UX comes great responsibility

- DEXs are often not newbie friendly 

    - There is a learning curve to self-custodying and creating a web wallet

    - Because of the immutability of blockchain transactions, it can be [easy for even savvy traders to learn an expensive lesson about human error](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/jo7lj2/help_needed_i_payed_235172_eth_9500_for_120/)

    - The process can be further intimidating when attempting to[ bridge assets on sidechains and L2s](https://ethhole.link/layer2) (and it is precisely smaller, newer traders who benefit most from[ lower fees](https://l2fees.info/))

- So it's not surprising that [many users - especially new market participants - would prefer to accept the counterparty risk of a custodial exchange](https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-regains-1-position-on-apple-app-store-as-crypto-com-jumps-to-third) in return for a consumer oriented and streamlined user experience:

    - Given lack of KYC/AML, the majority of DEXs do not allow for onboarding/offboarding fiat and require users to touch a centralized exchange at some point if they want to get money in or out of 'the system'.

        - To go back to the Compound bug, Leshner clarified that his 'doxx' comment was in reference to DeFi users' interactions with centralized exchanges:

         &gt; ""[He said that anyone could identify the public Ethereum addresses that interact with the Compound protocol, and whether they engaged with popular exchanges like Coinbase that collect information about users.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/business/dealbook/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen.html)""

    - Few DEXs natively offer the same level of trading functionality as centralized exchanges (e.g. limit orders, stop losses).

    - While centralized exchange users are primarily concerned with fees and spread, DEX users must also familiarize themselves with concepts like [slippage](https://academy.shrimpy.io/post/what-is-slippage-how-to-avoid-slippage-on-defi-exchanges) and [impermanent loss](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained)

- As the market becomes more saturated with DEX platforms and aggregators, it can be difficult for a lay user to evaluate competing promises of trustlessness and decentralization - or recognize when they're being exploited.

    - [Exit scams and rugpulls are prolific](https://decrypt.co/55787/defi-rug-pulls-were-cryptos-top-fraud-scheme-in-2020-ciphertrace) - newbies may find it challenging to verify if a DEX is legitimate, especially when dev teams are anonymous and many users lack technical proficiency to audit the protocol/smart contracts themselves.

- While hacks and phishing risks aren't limited to DEXs, they expose [users to additional attack vectors](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-identify-and-avoid-uniswap-scams):


    - Given [the ease of creating \(copy/pasting\) and listing a token](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/business/hype-coins-cryptocurrency.html), it's no surprise that scamcoins abound on DEXs, many of which [spoof legitimacy](https://twitter.com/uniwhalesio/status/1357785710896545792).

        - E.g., [researchers identified over 10K scam tokens and scam liquidity pools on Uniswap V2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00229).

        - Or check out [this recent attack which shows how Uniswap v3 liquidity pools can be manipulated](https://twitter.com/Mudit__Gupta/status/1455627465678749696).

    - More sinister is when [developers tweak the token contract to take your assets](https://twitter.com/r0bster97/status/1338182571558055937) or [remove a token's approval function](https://cryptot3ddybear.github.io/posts/scam-explained-bsc-noapproval/), preventing you from dumping the scamcoin you just bought.

    - Lastly, a DEX often requires users to approve or allow access to a given token before trading. [The default 'unlimited allowance' is convenient, but if exploited it allows bad actors to sweep your funds](https://learn.zapper.fi/articles/how-to-revoke-token-allowances).",2021-12-14 04:49:28

Kaiju_Rad,"First of all, don't be stubborn ass(pardon my French) about what job you want to do. Take whatever opportunity comes. Keep your learning curve good. Be open for feedback and suggestions. Don't give in or give up, remember what you are working for. 

Make friends with every kind of people. You may never know, when you might need them.

Help others as much as possible, it does not matter if they help you back or not. Either way, you will get learning or some good friends.

Get as much as experience possible, go for interviews where you have no chance. You will get free knowledge and best part, if you go for MNC that are super rich, like Google or Vmware or JPMC or any such top 5, you will get free food and beverage.

Never be ashamed of people mocking you or even humiliating you. Trust me, you will have the last laugh. I come from a family that will put you down or make you feel that you are not good enough. Heard from my own parents that, you better give up as you are not good enough.

 Try to sell yourself even if no one is asking for it. Trust me, they will remember you first, when they need something. But not like insta influencers. When I say sell yourself, I mean, make others understand how much value you can add or what new you can bring to the table. Trust me, you can use this to meet someone interesting.

Never worry about finance or getting stuck. Always remember if you want it that badly, you will figure a way out.

Finally, remember that your current situation is not permanent, it will pass. Even if you don't do anything also, things will change. Giving up will only make you feel bad. Never miss an opportunity. Even if it means losing money or having to put a pause to a relationship or getting to hear the worst from people around you. 

All of the above mentioned things are not something that I am preaching. I was in those situations and I gained from them. 

Also I choose this for me. I was that child who had no idea about what he wants to do or can get easily brainwashed by a movie and daydream about situation that will never happen in my life. 

Now I take care of my family, got married to a good girl. Travelled half of the world. Bought a car and a home in Bangalore.

Now, i'm not defending the blind hate, it makes me very sad that people are having such a negative sentiment over something that is beneficial towards them. The potential exists, I am very confident that this will not just be a bubble and will seriously change how finance works when all the problems start getting solved and the technology is innovated.

newtosh,"[Someone described](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/rdt3xc/daily_general_discussion_december_11_2021/ho5epw0/) LP positions in ETH/USDC as ""one of the highest possible risk adjusted returns of anything"". Please help me understand.

If I do stablecoin farming, I can get around 15-30% APY, e.g. in [this](https://app.beefy.finance/#/polygon/vault/curve-poly-eurt) EURt/DAI/USDC/USDT on Polygon/Beefy finance. Risks: Tether-collapse, Polygon-collapse, smart contract risks on curve and beefy.

If I want to LP, how would I even go about it? [This](https://app.beefy.finance/#/polygon/vault/quick-dai-eth) beefy DAI-ETH vault is based on QuickSwap and claims 25% APY. It's hard to find other APY estimates for QuickSwap/SushiSwap/UniSwap, especially with liquidity ranges in UniSwap v3. But I imagine 25% is typical?

To me, the main point seems to be that with LPs, I keep price exposure to ETH, which can be both negative or positive. Using an [IL calculator](https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/), an in initial $1000 LP position would be worth $1400 if ETH price doubles, and ~$700 if ETH price halves. Not sure what to make of that.

chopchopbeargrrr,"Few differences to call out here:

* Finance attorneys will likely work less in the aggregate but the spikes are far worse.  If you're an M&amp;A attorney, you're likely to have greater visibility into the process for an acquisition.  Finance won't be brought under the tent until things are actually shaping up to move forward in a meaningful way.  Even if you're a partner, your acquisition partner will let you know things are rumbling but the client won't want to rope you in until it's looking like the acquisition is moving forward.  
* Further to the above bullet, lender side is typically worse for the spikes - borrower's counsel will find out Monday or Tuesday that they need to have a document out to lenders, so they'll prepare in 48 hours, distribute to their client, spend another couple hours revising after a call with their client, and then fire it off early Friday or Saturday, while lender's counsel gets to spend their weekend working on the papers for a 48-60 hour turnaround.
* The difficulty curves are different - finance is closer to tax in intellectual demand than M&amp;A, M&amp;A has a fairly normal curve towards building a skillset, while a strong finance associate will be expected to pick up difficult and foreign concepts (often revolving around actual finance/accounting) in the background and then be proficient in them around year 5.

ToeTiddler,"I've shown you the math like 5 fucking times already, but your IQ skews so far to the left of the IQ distribution curve that you can't even follow basic arithmetic.

Here it is again (use the one where he doesn't have a depreciating asset I.e. car because he shouldn't fucking have one at that income level anyways, again, it's called sacrificing):


$26,141 take home pay

$2,180 monthly take home (rounded)

**Less:**

$725 for rent 

$133 for utilities 

$278.50 for groceries (median single person grocery bill in MD is $3,342 annually) 

$60 broadband internet

$60 cell phone 

$72 monthly transit pass (let's use a car instead so we won't deduct this amount, though it would be far more financially savvy for Johnny to not use a car if he can do so)

$151 auto loan payment ($2,000 car, $500 down, 36 mo. term at 4.99%). We'll also assume this is a constant payment I.e. it goes out beyond the 36 mo. term after he paid it off to account for maintenance and purchasing a new car years later.

$120 car insurance (probably a reasonable amount considering his car is only worth $2,000 but I didn't look into this very much)

$300 for spending cash

= monthly savings of $352.50

Annual savings of $4,230.

Let's assume Johnny's initial investment is $3,500, and he invests 80% of his monthly savings every month (I.e. $282).

At 8% interest the balance of his investment after 10 years = $58,351.28 + savings of $8,460 = $66,811.28.

At 10% interest the balance of his investment after 10 years = $65,439.71 + savings of $8,460 = $73,899.71.

He's pretty close but will take him a few more years to get to $100k.

Alternatively, if he took public transit all those years and used those car payments and insurance premiums to invest instead he would end up with $107,164.96 at the end of 10 years (at 8% annual interest), so he could make his goal if he cuts the car ownership out entirely.

The other consideration is that John/Jack/whoever the hell probably doesn't need $100k liquid cash to open a coffee shop. I bet he could get a loan for $50k and finance the other $50k himself rather than put all $100k in at once. Hell, he could probably get away with investing only $20k of his own capital. If he is smart he will borrow some, though, if he was smart he wouldn't be opening a coffee shop at all lol.

If you ask me, Johnny should focus on getting a higher paying job instead first, then he can live a little better and make even bigger investing gains down the line.

Side note, I have a very good friend (blue collar guy) makes $60k (Canadian dollars, so $46.5k USD) a year now (started at $45k I think - about $35k USD) and through prudent RE investments and sacrificing his standard of living by driving beater cars and living very cheaply (think he was investing close to 80% of his income) has amassed a RE portfolio worth a few million dollars (Canadian dollars) in about 7 years. Never had a six figure salary but has a fantastic net worth now because he made sacrifices and started investing early. Definitely helped that RE has appreciated in a major way in parts of Canada.

I think central exchanges are for those who are comfortable with it. In my opinion, for lots of people are safer than DeFi. Don’t get me wrong, i am %80 in DeFi. But i think, CEXs are fundamental for crypto adaption.

CEX are far more suitable for day trading and buying coins. At the end they are just services. Whenever I try to buy crypto through DeFi, there are huge fees. (For Atom withdrawals i use a CEX without any problem this week, but Binance usually suspends some blockchains (like polygon, matic). TBH, i never had problems withdrawing xlm or trc20 (hah never used erc20 that some exchanges still insisting to use it for exclusively). Banks seem to be a bigger problems in this equation. But in my opinion, we are way too early to take out intermediaries for crypto. 

I don’t even recommend anyone to use Metamask, if they are just entering crypto currency space. Few days ago, i saw a fake curve finance site, so fucking well made to take your seed phrase.

The efficacy of the virus has to be propped up as the world is dedollarizing.  Countries are having to take USD loans, putting up sovereign assets as collateral, to get these vaccines.  It's a playbook from the ""Confessions of an Economic Hitman"".  I get the sense there's a 1970s style dedollarization with Opec, particularly Saudi Arabia, attempting to turn away from the USD after the 2008 GFC created by our banksters.

Grim Finance didn't even hit 100m TVL (total value locked), Curve is 20b+ tvl... As well as being a much older contract, curve is clearly infinitely safer. Defi is a dangerous place and if you're not careful you will get baited by scammers and shit devs who pull you in with high apy's. Stick to the top protocols. Providing liquidity for a dex is about as safe as you can get. Yield aggregators (especially new ones) are where the exploits generally happen",2021-12-19 18:21:25

While the learning curve is steeper then python's, you may find it feels more like an application like SAS. I believe R is now widely used in academia for stats, finance, econometrics, and the like.

schmelf,Is this specifically about pensions? Because anything that’s mandated to hold lower risk assets right now is gonna be in pretty rough shape. I’m not necessarily advocating for increased risk but in order to break even against inflation right now the general public is being pushed out the risk curve. Bonds are at negative real yields right now so they are in fact return free risk. I personally think the risk climate in debt assets is worse than normal right now and yields are lower than ever (relatively speaking on a long term basis). I don’t think bonds are as low risk right now as conventional finance would lead you to believe. Debt to income levels are getting out of control and at some point people are going to have to start paying down their debt. Debt to income levels can’t just keep rising indefinitely.,2021-12-20 22:25:52
pvd255,"Doesn’t really matter, you’ll get most of your qualifications from actual work experience. That being said, think about the skills you want to bring to a program. Economics can be helpful if you want to work on monitoring and evaluation or baseline studies, etc. but you’d want to take more econometrics classes. Hard skills go a long way — engineering, public health, or finance can all be useful if you are capable of preparing financial models, review schematics for a proposed construction activity, or designing an evidence-based health intervention. On the flip side, overly project management based degrees are not useful (you will learn on the job and your experience will vary based on which donor you work for) and at no point ever will you need to know what an S-shaped curve look like to succeed in your career (so don’t major in development studies).",2021-12-20 23:08:25

sharaq,"I should unsub.  When Standard was the main driver of sales, between being fast between event coverage and eBay and predicting shifts in the meta, you'd have long quiet periods punctuated by intense price motion ripe for smart speculation.  When Archangel Avacyn was clearly positioned to dominate standard, for example, I went in DEEP on 3 dollar Ishkanahs just because it had 5 toughness and reach, which I unloaded a month later for 20 each.  

Now, it's pretty standard; buy limited run products and hold for 5 years to see what the price action is like.  EDH driving the market just isn't enjoyable from a speculation perspective.  You might see occasional corrections but never the feeling of beating the curve on a card that becomes a 4-of in a top tier deck next week.  You may as well just buy bonds.

LogrisTheBard,"A few brief predictions for 2022.

1) Incremental improvements to capital efficiency, especially in AMMs. Exchanges like Balancer are deploying their inactive liquidity to yield farms. Bancor v3 is targeting the same niche. Curve is branching out beyond like-kind assets and will compete with Sushi for the incentivized liquidity game.

2) Better Liquidity automation and management tools on top of Uniswap v3. XToken is going more heavily in that direction. We have Visor, Tokemak is coming online, Impermax is slowly gaining TVL.

3) We'll see the rise of more liquidity direction right (LDR) tokens in the style of Curve, Pickle, etc. Scheduled regular votes that direct emissions. YFI seems to already be going there. I see no reason Impermax, XToken, Alchemix, etc won't follow. If you have emissions, granting governance control over those emissions adds value to the governance token. This will lead to escalated CRV wars. More bribe platforms like Convex, Votemak, and Badger. Someone might even generalize the concept (feel free to steal Concave finance).

4) More tools for DAOs like Coordinape, Snapshot, and KPIs. Bonds will continue to gain traction. Liquidity Direction protocols like Tokemak will come online and slowly replace direct emissions to Pool-2's. Defi is going to revolutionize liquidity farming as you know it.

5) More protocols will use staking funds as an insurance backstop for protocol failure. Some day we're going to see a more successful insurance model than Nexus Mutual, Umbrella, weird prediction markets, etc. In the short term though staking pools are the likely answer.

6) We'll start to see more protocols directly incentivize voter participation. Eventually we'll see the rise of some type of standardized vote delegation system but it may not be this year. Also we'll eventually see some bonded voting mechanisms appear such as UMA KPIs but probably not in mass this year.

7) Mass migrations of liquidity to Ethereum L2's. L2 Summer was a dud but this is style coming in a big way.

8) Stable coin growth to $1T. Might not all be on Ethereum and the distribution will hopefully continue to shift away from Tether but we did more than 10x last year and its only like 6-7x to $1T. That will put stablecoins at about 1% of all fiat supply. The US can't ignore this.

9) More 'badge' style NFTs such as POAPs that can only be unlocked based your history. These will become increasingly gamified and woven into more complex systems.

10) Institutional staking. We saw Ether capital start staking. Maybe we'll see ETHE start staking. Eventually someone big is going to stake through Rocketpool and keep the extra Node fees as their profit. The fuse is already lit on this.",2021-12-21 08:04:19

KGrahnn,"This is only true if you are a potato. For example I have no trouble gaining credits up to tier 10 while playing with no boosters and no premium time. If you are a good enough player, you can choose what to play, you dont need premium accout necessarily. You need it only if you are a potato.

 Normal curve is somewhat like that a potato can still play upto tier 8 and not go bankrupt, but higher tiers will most often drain the credits. Thus it forces most players to play lower tiers. It has an effect which spreads players wider across the tiers. This way everyone are not playing only the tier 10. It also has an effect that some players pay real money for premium time, which allows then to play more higher tiers, than without premium time. And real money allows WG to finance this game for people who are playing it for free.

The balance is quite intricate. Its quite possible to play all tiers, but its intentionally designed as such, that its more easier and enjoyable, as well less stressful to play, if you have premium time. I have premium time for example just because it makes my life easier. Most often I got no time to play try hard, and I want to casually enjoy some of my non meta tanks. Those tanks have certain weaknesses which can be overcome or make less weak by for example shooting premium ammo and using premium consumables. 

This doesnt mean I would have full load of gold, but if I empty one clip of amx 13 57 gold rounds into is3 side in one gmame, it wont bankrupt me. With premium account I can do this more often, and I dont have to even think about it. And it allows me to not think about it, I can just casually throw it, if I see an opportunity in a game. Without premium time I would probably think the cost of using the premium rounds, and the opportunity would go past and most often cost the game as well. One decisive flanking fight might affect the match so, that you win it in that moment for your team. You kill that tank which was crucial for enemy flank, and the potato teammates of yours finally have courage to advance, when that evil is3 is dead.

Thus few premium rounds  can make a difference and win more games for you.

But wot being unplayable? This is not true. Even if you are a potato, it only forces you to play lower tiers more often, to finance few higher tier games, until you again need to grind credits again at lower tiers. And if you climb up from the pile of shit and shine like a star, instead being just turd, you can choose to play what ever tier you want to.",2021-12-22 11:06:16
Adam_The_Millennial,"A majority of welfare programs don’t allow people to get on unless they work. Minus programs for people with kids because it isn’t about taking care of the parents in that case. The only reason why a lot of those single mothers don’t work is because we have very garbage child care programs. 

Politicians set it up to where most of these single mothers have to choose between not working and focusing on their kids or to work a job and not have money or time for their kids. 

A majority of the people on welfare are not fraudsters. Data shows maybe 1/10 applications are fraudulent. 
- www.lexingtonlaw.com/blog/finance/welfare-statistics.html/amp

If you are against those who defraud the system, I implore you to campaign against them rather than our welfare as a whole. We are the richest country in the world we should have no one starving. 

Even if we had every single person housed and fed on tax dollars, it’s not like these people are guaranteed to have enough money for everything they want. Honestly? That system would show even more who is willing to work because then people will be free to work for the things they want. They will be able to work for the economic positions they want. 

Everyone is too busy drowning and trying to survive instead of focusing on improving themselves or society. This won’t be something that can be fixed in one presidential term. This is going to take a generation or several to improve even if we start it right now full throttle. 

You’re right that not every single person in poverty will be able to be the next einstein. But some of them will. I was born into poverty. My family never had welfare growing up. I joined the military because being a physicist and mathematician isn’t economically viable.  

I served honorably and meritoriously for my entire adult life up until I was injured in service and was medically separated right before the pandemic. 

Now I have been studying computer science, AI, and how to improve our educational systems with game engines and VR. I don’t have to stress to survive because my disability payments are enough to have my basic necessities. 

Now I am free to put my brain to advancing our country. I always scored in the top percentile of the ASVAB and any other training program I went into during service. I got multiple meritorious promotions and trained hundreds of marines. But all that was stuff I was not passionate about. I still did it because I was capable and liked teaching others. 

But now? Thanks to VA disability, I am doing stuff I am passionate about. I can’t run or bend down anymore, but I can work at a computer. I know I am not the typical case, but these social safety nets turned a disabled body who can’t work anymore into someone who can help thousands in the future. If one in ten are fraudsters, maybe one in ten are like me as well. And I am sure I will be able to add more value to the US with my efforts than the few thousand dollars that fraudster drains. 

Yes. There are lazy people who have no aspirations, but a majority of people aren’t like that. 

Yes. There are a lot of unintelligent people in poverty, but literally half of them are above average. There are just as many intelligent people per capita in every single population. The bell curve will show up in every population for every metric. 

If we throw out the programs that help the disadvantaged just because 1/10th of the people are fraudulent, that means that all the people who legitimately benefit get left in the dust too. 

We should be empowering the population and then going after the fraudsters instead of generalizing the fraudsters to the majority because it is objectively not true that a majority of them are fraudulent or unintelligent. 



—- one more caveat. I used intelligence, not education in this entire argument. Poor people will almost always be less educated due to lack of opportunity. But there will be just as many intelligent people in that group as any other group. Intelligence is your ability to learn, not how much you know. 

What happens when we ensure a majority of our intelligent people can focus on advancing society?",2021-12-22 11:53:53

The learning curve for me has been extremely steep and it's hard. I'm an SDE in an IB but work as a big data engineer so I had to learn Java, many tools of CI/CD, spring, spring boot, Hadoop, hive, hbase, spark, Kafka, flume, AKS and docker.

There were finance topics and basic stuff like jira which everyone has to learn so not counting here and many others which I definitely have forgotten.

According-Object-502,"&gt;You’re getting downvoted and maybe it’s because of how you said it, but I think you are bang on.

I'm suprised I'm not getting down voted more. The truth hurts and people don't like hearing it. A tube driver in London earns £100k a year. That's just a tube driver and people are talking about £50k as if that makes them a highly qualifed high earner. 

If you take a random person earning 50k a year, say a recruitment consultant, they'll talk about the world as if they're Alan Sugar.  They think YOU should listen to them because they're sucessful and know things. The only thing they know is how to talk shit on the telephone and how to live pay cheque to cheque.

People are downvoting what I've said because it's them who I'm describing. Deep down inside they know they don't earn loads of money. They know they're no one important, they know no one gives a fuck about their instagram photos. No one cares when they see a photo of the one time you ate a starter in The Ivy. People rather just ignore their own reality because ignorance is bliss.

I live in a central London borough in a 2 bedroom flat. I know how much I earn and how much I've paid to live in a FLAT.  I don't regard myself as ""rich"". The house for sale on the next road is £25 million, and people are still pretending £50k a year makes them a high earner?! The year isn't 1982. 

If you think £50k a year is a lot a money, that just shows how far behind the information curve you really are. You're no where near the category of ""high earner"". That's why it seems like I'm talking about silly numbers. Being a high earner is not your reality. It's something you can't comprehend because that's not YOU. Get over over yourself and realise there's more to the world than your own little bubble where £50k a year is lot. 

Even somewhere in the north like Manchester, £500k isn't buying you a mansion. It's buying a NORMAL 3/4 bedroom detached house out the very outskirtks of the city. £250k is going to buy a studio flat/bedsit in the city center. All of this assumes the average person has a spare £50k in cash laying out to put down a deposit/cover other costs. Yet people think their £50k a year makes them an important high earner? They can't even buy a normal sized home on their own. They've got to get shacked up with someone they don't really love just so they can get a mortgage. That's not a ""high earner""

On top of this, the Government is artifically propping up the property market. The cut in stamp duty didn't benefited the average person. The guy on £50k a year didn't just buy a second home in Cornwall to work remotely from. He bought a trampoline or a hot tub on finance to put in his rented garden. That's the best it's going to get for them.

It might be blunt to say this stuff, but it doesn't mean I'm wrong. The average person is so full of their own bullshit, opinions and shit they've read on the internet. They're completely blind to the reality that they're not earning ""loads of money"". 

Everyday, the future standard of living for the average person is slipping further down the toliet. They're blissfully ignorant to the fact while sleep walking from pay cheque to cheque. They only pause for a moment so they can talk to someone like shit, post a staged photo on instagram, or to act outraged that their ""expert opinion"" isn't being taken seriously.

marcuscontagius,"You seem to be implying that the treasury’s sole purpose is to sustain a high APY for the entirety of the runway? The minting/binding is what determines/sustains the APY, not the treasury…it’s why when minting rates are diminished so are rebase rates..

Glad you mentioned utility because that is the purpose of the treasury in the cases I mentioned.

If you’re at all familiar with the dynamics of the curve protocol and the role that the dao voting token plays in guiding pool reward rates, and by extension, pool liquidity then you would understand why the convex token (each of which controls ~6-7 crv voting tokens at the moment) is super important to terms of utility (google the curve wars). Add in the fact that convex has a capped supply and it’s pinwheel dynamics dictate it’s relative crv voting power per CVX token can only increase with time, and you have a pretty strong case for utility. Seems like a pretty smart capital allocation doesn’t it?

Pair this power to control, in effect, where people will put liquidity in curve (the largest protocol in defi) and you have a way to enhance whatever project you’ve invested in/seeded. You have a really effective way to provide lots of liquidity for your protocol. (Abracadabra/MIM was a classic example of this, and not surprisingly they are the same team behind wonderland finance). 

So now you’ve got the treasury full of cash to seed ideas and protocols or investments that you like and you control a mechanism to help protocols lock value and drive adoption to improve the odds of success and therefore a high ROI. 

The other example of deploying capital to drive revenue for stakers I mentioned was a position that returns 54 million/year on a 100 million stable coin investment. I’m not sure who you are but that isn’t really something many folks would sneeze at the way you did. Maybe you’re some investment whiz kid or something idk..if you do the math that’s a return of $7 on every $100 worth of TIME per year that someone holds and that’s only utilizing ~15% of the treasury for reference, Intel’s dividend is a return of $2.74 on every $100 held per year on 100% of the capital Intel deploys.

Capitalism is inherently exploitative and nothing else. As for a deeper look into the mechanisms that maintain capitalism and all other unjust economic models, I'll say it's these three things: corruption, propaganda, and warfare.

* Corruption to keep the tyrants' whims above the masses' needs.

* Propaganda to manufacture consent and acceptance from the oppressed.

* Warfare to expand its brand of exploitation and plunder on the tyrants' behalves.

You may have intended this question to be rhetorical, but I think it's a fun one to discuss for two reasons particularly because of the example you used: clothes.

1. They have an [inelastic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/inelastic.asp) demand curve. The profit motive of capitalism *easily* abuses this as Eccentric Rants describes in [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI_qDCguCXM)

2. Clothes in of themselves tend to have a very small [marginal utility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginalutility.asp) rate. This means that people don't need that many of them to be truly satisfied for long periods of time. 

Granted, all sectors of our economy should be unionized; but clothing and textiles should definitely be among the first 10 industries to be a public good sometime after food, water, healthcare, shelter, and banking/finance.",2021-12-24 09:14:15
ChottoTheFuck,"Not your keys not your coins.

When you lend your stables on Cefi options like hodlnaught, they are being used for more yields in defi applications such as those below.

Here are the defi alternatives if you wanna DIY and own everything.

1. Anchor protocol 19.5% on UST

2. AAVE on Polygon, deposit USDC, Borrow USDT, convert to USDC, redeposit that, rinse and repeat. Around 10-12% apy plus additional matic rewards, while hedging against USDT collapse.

3. Curve finance on Polygon. Liquidity mine USDC, DAI, USDT pair. 5% apy on fees, plus additional 2% in CRV and 3% in Matic.

4. Lending stables on Alpha Homora on Avalanche. Lend USDC, 9% APY on USDC, additional 4% in AVAX and 3% in Alpha.

5. Balancer on Polygon, liquidity provide on USDC/DAI/USDT/TUSD. 17% APR

6. Degenbox UST, this is absoulutely degenerate what else can I say. 100%+ apy on stables",2021-12-24 15:41:57
ChottoTheFuck,"I am currently ""risk on"" at the moment, so I don't do any stablecoin strategies right now but I am well aware of what I could do with stables as well and I am ready to switch to them if markets look choppy. So right now I run variations of the above strategies using crypto tokens instead of stables.

I currently use 2 of the above strategies and I am also using others that I have not described in the above.

Let me give you an example of what I am doing on AAVE right now, I deposit my Ethereum into AAVE, borrow USDT which has the most favorable borrow rates, convert that into DAI which has the most favorable deposit rates, redeposit that, and repeat once more to further increase yields while keeping a safe leverage ratio.

I would say the easiest if you want stablecoins yield is Anchor Protocol, just deposit it, easy 19.5% APY, no management, no farm tokens, no strategies whatsoever needed. However, Anchor is on the Terra blockchain so you would either have to use UST, or you would have to use a third party Ethereum aggregate like Orion Money if you still wish to stick with USDC. However, you will have to give them a cut and have it reduced to 16% APY. I have written a guide on how to use Anchor, but if thats not your thing you can use Alpha Homora as well, thats pretty nice and easy.

If you are just dealing with stablecoins, your risk is considerably less however you still have to watch out for depegging, and smart contract risk. For instance, 4 days ago, the auto compounder Grim Finance had a bug in it's code and someone exploited it to drain the protocol of all of its funds. $30 Million worth of Fantom tokens were stolen, all who used Grim Finance lost it all. Grim finance was apparently also an audited protocol so this was a shock to many.

Smart contract risk is unavoidable but it can be mitigated by using battle tested protocols.

Reputable protocols who have multi chain adoption like AAVE &amp; Curve is way safer than newer protocols such as Alpha Homora (although this one is pretty safe too). You want to use protocols which have higher TVLs as it would have more financial backing and be able to have a more robust development team and audit companies.

kola401,"I missed this message. Let's dissect your argument

&gt;Pair this power to control, in effect, where people will put liquidity in curve (the largest protocol in defi) 

Isn't curve for stablecoins? Wonderland TIME isn't a stablecoin.

&gt;and you have a way to enhance whatever project you’ve invested in/seeded.

I don't get this argument. Why would curve be used to fund liquidity for Wonderland? It's a stablecoin DEX. 

&gt;So now you’ve got the treasury full of cash to seed ideas and protocols or investments that you like and you control a mechanism to help protocols lock value and drive adoption to improve the odds of success and therefore a high ROI.

That's just a bloated argument. Is the ROI better than the value taken away from liquidity? $1B stolen from the marketcap and they are using a % of that to invest against fiat inflation rate.

And your argument doesn't mention the risk of DEFI so the risk of a complete loss is although unlikely, still possible. Not only they have to beat the inflation rate of their stablecoin treasury, they can't invest the entirety of their treasury, only in small amounts.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;returns 54 million/year on a 100 million stable coin investment

Except the treasury isn't $100M isn't it. It's close to $1B. What's the inflation rate per year of $1B? Im guessing minimum around $10M per year

These returns are insignificant to investors.

&gt;If you do the math that’s a return of $7 on every $100 worth of TIME per year that someone holds and that’s only utilizing \~15% of the treasury for reference,

Except you forgot to mention they can't invest 100% of their treasury. It's too high risk. If they invest in smaller amounts, the returns will always be less than the value taken away from the liquidity of the coin.

In traditional finance, you can easily invest billions because there's enough protection in place with unlimited printing.

In DEFI, a protocol mistake, high fees or congestion means you can easily lose much if not all your investments. Your argument is flawed because Wonderland can't utilize the majority of their treasury enough to cover for the massive bubble they created by taking the liquidity away from the open market.",2021-12-25 07:04:59

As for advice, really hard to give knowing nothing about you. Accounting pays very well, even in government. It is an easy path to a middle to upper middle class life if you survive the grind and don’t settle on the entry level clerk, AP, AR, etc. jobs for life.

You learn a lot regarding finance, which can benefit you in your personal life. You won’t be the typical uneducated person talking about taxes, you’ll learn how to read financials for investing, and how to legally avoid taxes and defer them.

Personally I’ve found what I’ve learned to be extremely beneficial outside of work.

But accounting isn’t for the faint of heart, the grind of long hours to succeed is real, but career advancement is almost guaranteed if you don’t give up. The career path is very set in stone and you’ll know where you should be, which is fairly nice.

I suggest you look at Mint, Personal Capital or Quicken's ""online only"" product SimpliFi.  The first two are free products.  SimpliFi has a free trial period, but is a subscription product that is browser and app based.

tradegreek,"I think the key is really more about how well you can signal your understanding of the role in regards to your actual duties and day-to-day work. The only two hesitancies a firm would have as far as I can see are inter-firm dynamics in that it could be weird to hire a 42-year-old in the same role as a 21-year-old. In theory, it doesn't matter, however, in reality, you can only expect that the 42-year-old would have different wants and needs to the 21-year-old. I don't think it's unreasonable to assume the 42-year-old would desire a faster career trajectory as well as salary. Therefore I think it's important you are aware that this isn't feasible and so you probably need to work on getting it across that you are looking for the same sort of career trajectory as the 21-year-old. This isn't to say that you emphasize that you are just looking to learn and grow your skillset etc. I feel like this would be a mistake as let's face it anyone who has done grad schemes knows that at first the learning curve can feel exponentially but it does slow down dramatically after a while depending on how technical the role is etc. Therefore I think it's important that you can also get across that you are also just willing to grind hard and really understand what the sort of day-to-day work is whether that's writing endless pitchbooks or finishing models etc. 

I personally think that if you are older and looking to break in you really need to focus on smaller shops (depending on what area of finance you want to break into, you haven't really implied where so I am being generic). I think the smaller offices will allow you (if you have the ability / competence) to thrive and have faster career progression than if you apply to a larger / more hierarchical instituion. Ultimately I think that for the most part grad schemes/entry jobs aren't that enjoyable after that initial learning curve starts to flatten as they are more boring/repetitive (my experience was 5 years in Investment Banking in London at an elite bank). Therefore my worry in hiring someone older is that they would be less willing to just do the grind and get it over with. At a smaller shop, you will get a lot more responsibility and earlier on as well as probably have to work more dynamically across multiple workstreams, etc. where the grind will take longer to sink in.",2021-12-29 02:20:48

For some reason this subreddit hates crypto. I think it's just that Ireland is generally a bit behind the curve on upcoming tech. Whether people like it or not though, web3 is happening and it will become more mainstream over time. You could look at some web3 crypto projects with potential. Personally I like the Algorand protocol which is being used for applications like Central Bank Digital Currencies. Algorand also pays out (I think roughly) 14% APY in rewards, along with any money gained from its growth.",2021-12-30 00:47:59
RonMexico2005,"Responding to: ""Could someone make a bearish case for digital assets \[for 2022\]?""

Personally I am bullish, but here are my bear notes:

A - there are two recurring (for several years) crypto mainstream media stories: (1) Bitcoin is volatile, and (2) Shitcoin of the week was a fraud, and sympathetic victims lost a lot of money. This news cycle has forestalled and likely will continue to forestall faster digital asset adoption.

B - new for 2021 is recurring mainstream news story (3) artist lights a painting on fire (or similar), records it as an NFT, someone pays a fortune for it.  This story is working to instill in the mind of the general public that ""NFT = joke"" much like the general public ""doesn't get"" art in general, or associates fancy restaurants with tiny portions; and more broadly makes the NFT an acronym for ""Not For Them."" So this skewed perception by the general public is likely to forestall digital asset adoption.

C - whenever asked about it in the news, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon says he thinks Bitcoin is worthless. The general public knows that in America, you don't get to be CEO of a company as large as JP Morgan by being stupid or by being related to someone in the ruling political party, you get there by being among the best at what you do and outcompeting tons of smart, motivated people. And while people expect CEO's to talk their own book of business (i.e. traditional finance in this case) and take what they hear with a grain of salt, they're still taking it in. What the CEO of one of the largest American banks thinks about the future of finance is relevant to the future of finance whether you think he is wrong (and whether he is in actual fact wrong) or not.

So the mainstream media has for years had a multi-headed anti-digital assets campaign, with new additions as technology advances (e.g. NFT's in 2021). And while digital assets have been marching up in spite of this, at some point, it will really need buy-in from the general public.  On the well-known technology adoption curve, we are probably in the early stages of ""early adopters,"" and the real take-off comes when the ""early majority"" shows up.  Which may or may not happen, and can be heavily influenced by propaganda, including what is being fed to the general public.

Why is the media against digital assets?  They are not so much against them as they are strongly for protecting the incumbent rich people and social order. Once the incumbents like Visa (who pay for media advertising heavily) figure out how to squash the upstarts like Flexa, the media will embrace digital assets with open arms.  Until then it is a threat.  The way for Flexa to overcome the threat, survive, and prosper, is to partner with other incumbents like the big banks, to supplant the payment processing incumbents like Visa.  You have a fair chance to win an incumbent vs. incumbent fight in a regulated industry.  You don't really have a fair chance in a startup vs. incumbent fight. Not to say you can't win, but the deck is stacked against you.",2021-12-30 01:15:37
AbysmalScepter,"Easy, safe and sustainable - you could probably get about $25 per month with $3,000.

A bit further out the risk curve, you could probably check out products like Anchor Protocol or Ribbon Finance that give you $50-$60/month.

complexsystems,"With your profile, I'd advise against pursuing graduate school in economics, given what you've posted here &amp; elsewhere. First, you're likely not competitive at a \~US top 30 programs, nor at top 4 Canadian. For perspective, going to \*econ\* graduate school for \~6 years will likely lead to an expected salary less than $150k if you stay in or adjacent to academia (think tanks, central banks, professor at a school), and strictly cost you salary subject to the $30-40k/yr stipend students typically get.

That stated, with a background in EE, you likely have the requisite math at some point, and you'll just want to credibly signal you've kept up competencies in those areas (multivariate calculus, linear algebra). Your MBA experience will be highly discounted, but as long as you can show you have an interest in economics (and phds in marketing/finance pay off even better than econ, and perhaps reconnecting with the prof suggesting the phd in analytics is a way to go) you still might get in. If your school is known to curve harshly, you can assume admissions committees are vaguely aware of it, and upwards trajectory in grades is good, particularly if you did well in capstone math courses. While I haven't done admissions, the further away from school the less people care about it, and showing you're interested and knowledgeable about what it takes to succeed as a research economist is the biggest hurdle you'll face.

nv42o,"poker vs roulette. nice idea, that‘s an analogy i can get behind. 
Unfortunately from an academic perspective there is no way to consistently beat the market. Markets have been proven information efficent for over a hundred years. Not only is every information priced in, you have to think bigger, every expectation, every small event, every possible scenario is accumulated into the price you see.

However, to come back to your roulette wheel. the stock market can be viewed as a roulette wheel where there are 19 red and 18 black fields (no zero). Would this be gambling from your POV? Because this is actually how markets function. you have daily returns on a bell curve but if you transform it into a dummy variable you‘d get something like the skewed roulette board. 
if you bet on red maybe you will lose sometime but due to the rule of large numbers, in the end you will have made a profit. The red fields in Finance would be going long as we can observe a positive mean return. if it were different, going short would be also viable.",2021-12-30 22:12:36
