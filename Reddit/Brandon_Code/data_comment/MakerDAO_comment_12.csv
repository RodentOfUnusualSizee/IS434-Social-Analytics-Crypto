nikola_j,"Thanks for the tag as always, kwadrax!

Good point on highlighting the layers of risk in this case. In general, if you're only running a MakerDAO Vault, for example, there's no way for you to be affected by issues in Aave/Liquity/Reflexer/Compound, but there is a layer of DFS smart contracts to be considered, and there are other integrations too, namely exchanges, or rather exchange aggregators.",2021-12-01 02:18:02

Leza89,"&gt;Is it the lack of FDIC insurance,

You ONLY need this, if you do your business with centralized parties. You don't need insurance if you actually move into the Crypto space.

&gt;the constant pump and dumping of coins

Don't buy shitcoins. And if you tell me that Bitcoin is also pumping and dumping, then you should never go to the stock market or heck.. the gas station. Even Bluechips are manipulated.

&gt; the fact that exchanges are often criminal enterprises (Mt Gox, Bitfinex), the best US exchange locking its customers out routinely

Aaaaaand centralized exchanges have exactly what to do with Crypto? They could sell wheat, oil, hamsters or camels and the problems you're describing would be exactly the same. HOWEVER: Crypto creates Decentralized exchanges that do not suffer these problems.

&gt; the fact that Tether is admittedly backed by blank check chinese commercial paper

Tether just uses Blockchain technology. Tether is still centralized, as is Ripple, IOATA, Stellar Lumens and many, many other shitcoins. You can't compare decentralized projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Litecoin, ... with the likes of centralized shitshows.

Btw: there are even decentralized stablecoins, if you (rightfully) don't trust Tether; For example DAI (MakerDao).

&gt;the fact that whales own a larger percentage of the crypto pie as you

See above.. that is the 80/20 rule in action and could be, again, sad about wheat, oil, hamsters or camels.. (or dollars, for that matter)

&gt;or is it the maturity level of the youtubers shilling the next beanie babie coin with no perspective on historical asset bubbles that makes you trust in the crypto space so much?

The same can be said about:

- gold, silver, other precious metals
- real estate
- stocks (EV-market, any1?)

see my 2nd point: Don't buy shitcoins.",2021-12-01 23:11:57

FaceDeer,"I suspect the votes with the biggest ""weight"" are the exchanges and the big dapp teams like MakerDAO. Those are the votes that determine which tokens actually have *value* and which are penny trash.

So as EIP-1559's fork came up and the miners had to decide whether to go with the EIP-1559 fork or stick with the old fork they looked at which one would actually *pay* them to mine.

DaddySkates,"# DAI: A Systematically Sustainable Stablecoin

&amp;#x200B;

Some who aren't yet familiar with the concept of stablecoins may ask themselves..what exactly that magical coin that is going up even in bear market?

Stablecoins are a group of cryptocurrencies where the price is pegged to (usually) a FIAT money such as dollar, yen, euro;  a cryptocurrency, or simply to exchange-traded commodities. These are cryptocurrencies that try to minimize the volatility in crypto market.  Stable coins provides us secure transactions, instant transfers without borders, low fees and quick settlements.

**What about DAI stablecoin?**

DAI is a stable coin that is issued by MakerDAO. It's an Ethereum-based protocol, which maintains an exact ratio of one-to-one with the USD. DAI as a stable coin is used for lending or borrowing crypto without any need for 3rd party making it a permissionless, transparent system with minimal restrictions.

**What makes DAI so special when we already have so many stablecoins?**

We have Tether, USDC, PAX, BUSD and others that are already providing all that stablecoins need.

DAI  keeps price in check with advanced smart contract system that is fully automated. If When price of DAI starts going too far from USD, Maker (abbrevated MKR) tokens are burned or created in order to stabilize the price of DAI.

The system manages the price of without the need of 3rd party which could pose as potential fraudulent activity on chain or simply middleman taking its cut. If the system works as intended and DAI keeps the constant value to US dollar, the holders of MAKER coins get benefits because the total supply of MKR is burned and through that the value increases with supply and demand.

**Can you just create DAI?**

Not as one would think. DAI isn't printed like FIAT in unlimited quantities but is instead created when a user takes a loan on Maker DAO. When that loan is paid the DAI is burned.

**That's all great and everything but surely it has some downsides right?**

Even though it's almost hard to be sceptical about it, there definitely are downsides to DAI

&amp;#x200B;

* Since it's rather advanced that can be a barrier which some people, mainly newcomers to crypto and DeFi aren't willing to overcome and they will simply choose the easiest and most user friendly option.
* Currently collateral in MakerDAO is rather limited.    Basic Attention Token (BAT), USDC, WBTC, TUSD, KNC, ZRX, MANA, ETH are the only one's available. Unless that list becomes far larger, it isn't the best option out there.
* Creating DAI vault is rather complicated and can pose a security risk.  In order to generate DAI one must transfer ownership of their assets to a smart contract that can sell your assets in the event of a market recession. It is a common practice among users to maintain a high collateral ratio to protect themselves from market risks and therefore liquidation, which makes this feel like leverage trading.
* A smart contract may be transparent and immutable, but lately there have been a lot of security holes unfamously the hack of DAO. Nothing is unhackable, at least not at present time.

A nice fact that not many know is that DAI actually ""started"" here on Reddit with eDollar.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ok, you convinced me but I need some TLDR PROs because I don't want to read this wall of text!**

Alright. To sum it up why DAI is one of the best stablecoins out there:

* \- The marketing from MakerDAO is starting to really get insane momentum and they are branding the DAI as the worlds first unbiased currency.
* \- DAI doesn't need real US dollar in order to back it. It works on completely different level and unlike Tether it's a much more reliable and secure way to run a stablecoin.
* \- DAI competitors USDT and USDC are controlled by the governing companies, which makes it hard to define such cryptocurrencies as decentralised. DAI is independent.
* \- You can't print DAI like you can print FIAT. Issuing DAI is governed by smart contracts which are immutable. Noone has ability to interfere with DAI.
* \- DAI isn't backed by FIAT but instead it's macked by cryptocurrency.
* \- Interaction between DAI and smartcontracts gives it a good support in DeFi. There are already over 400 DeFi apps that integrated DAI.
* \- Another very important point is that they have a really kickass logo

FaceDeer,"I haven't actually used Tornado.cash myself, but I read up on it a while back and as I recall it's got some features that make this more difficult.

A Tornado pool has a pre-defined chunk size that all deposits and withdrawals must be equal to, so if for example you had 100 ETH you wanted to process and you were using a Tornado pool with 1 ETH chunk size you'd have to make 100 1-ETH deposits into it. Later you could make up to 100 1-ETH withdrawals. Everyone else using that pool would also be putting in and taking out 1-ETH amounts.

Tokens can be left sitting in a Tornado pool for as long as you want. If the hacker puts 100 ETH in, he can leave it in there for years as other people continue adding and removing Ether over that time. Or he could be withdrawing it piecemeal over that period. There's no way to tell.

And finally, Ether itself is completely fungible. So if the authorities try to enforce some kind of ""contamination"" rule where everything that comes out of a Tornado pool is considered tainted, you can fire off a couple of withdrawals from your pool into some big exchange's hot wallet and there'd be no way to distinguish it from the tens of thousands of ""legitimate"" Ether that's in there. Or trade your Ether for other currencies through a decentralized exchange, or turn it into DAI using MakerDAO, there's any number of ways to do permissionless conversions that will further spread the taint around and make the whole blockchain a hopeless jumble of blacklistings spreading like an unstoppable virus. Soon the only parts of the blockchain that continue to function at all will be the parts that don't participate in blacklistings like that.",2021-12-05 17:31:47

The last stable coin standing will be DAI, but if the underlaying assets that back DAI decrease fast enough the MAKERDAO guys can vote (this vote will be extremely expensinve in terms of gas fees cause everybody is panicing making tx after tx) and hit the emergency button.

So DAI, it's peg might break but will also be the first to bounce back.

However every single stablecoin that does not have a mechanism that depends on math vs humans will lose it's peg.

These stablecoins have been 1 dollar because people believe they are one dollar. That faith will soon be gone and every stablecoin will have a peg break.

There are two type of stablecoin companies

- those that are willing to pay with their own money to keep their peg stable

- those that are not willing to pay with their own money to keep their peg stable.

And then there is a third category:

those that never had any money to begin with.

Under collateralized systems in crypto are **hard** due to identifying trustworthy actors. [Maple Finance](https://www.maple.finance/) is tackling this problem.

As for the use case of a decentralized stablecoin, platforms like xBacked or MakerDAO allow people to lock their collateral (e.g Algo) and mint a stablecoin to then go and get yield elsewhere in an ecosystem. For example, instead of selling Algo for USDC to invest in a new project, you could mint xUSD and invest using that instead. The other part of it is that, as others have mentioned, how do you know there is $1 backing 1 USDT? At least in open, decentralized protocols like xBacked, everything is transparent and 100% backed.

For the xBacked protocol specifically, you will be able to stake xUSD to participate in liquidations and receive Algo from liquidated vaults.",2021-12-06 05:57:55

Revanchist1,"**The Curve Wars**


**The Battle For High TVL**

DeFi protocols live and die by their Total Value Locked (TVL). The first great war for TVL was the battle of Uniswap and Sushiswap. DeFi summer saw the a plethora of DeFi protocols being launched.  When ChefNomi forked Uniswap to create Sushiswap - they had to incentivize users to deposit their funds on a new platform. After all, an AMM with low TVL will be inefficient for large volume traders trying to swap between coins without high slippage. Sushiswap - which aimed to be a community governed Automatic Market Maker - first incentivized users to stake LP positions from Uniswap on the platform to earn Sushi Tokens. This was done via Liquidity Mining. First used by IDEX (2017) in a very primitive form, then refined in DeFi summer with Synthetix and Compound (2020). After Sushiswap gained enough liquidity, history was made. This was the first time in DeFi History (and in finance history) where a vampire attack was carried to such a large degree. In the space of a week **$1 Billion** was siphoned from Uniswap and into SushiSwap. The Uniswap team could do nothing but watch as Sushiswap took users, liquidity, and trading volume away from their platform. This inevitably led to Uniswap launching their own governance token - UNI.

**Rules Of The Game**

Players in DeFi win by attracting liquidity via offering better yields for users

**Stability In The Curve**

Curve is an AMM for Stablecoins and helps maintain the 1:1 Peg. It is a major building block underpinning all of DeFi. 

*Side note: Curve v2 is aiming to compete with Uniswap and other AMMs.* 

Launched on August 13, 2020 - Curve incentives users depositing stablecoins via liquidity mining of CRV tokens. 

**CRV** can be locked to received **vote escrowed Curve** **(veCRV)** tokens.

veCRV is used to vote in the CurveDAO in return they get boosted rewards from LPing into pools, trading fees from pools, and other things. The important one is having a say in the gauge weight - or how much of the newly minted CRV is distributed to each pool.

Because of how important Curve is to the ecosystem, owning Curve is extremely important for DAOs. 



Curve Docs - 
https://resources.curve.fi/

**Key takeaway: Owning veCRV boosts your yield.**

If a new project is launching a stablecoin, having a say where Curve rewards go will help bootstrap your projects TVL/Liquidity.


**Yearn and the Andre's Foresight**

Yearn Finance was an early user of CRV and player in the Curve War. Yearn launched the backscratcher vault in November of 2020 - a one way vault allowing users to lock curve in exchange for yearn vote escrowed Curve (**yveCRV**). yveCRV gave better yields for users compared to the the regular veCRV so it naturally began accumulating a higher value of locked CRV tokens.


Yearn would then use the veCRV gained to vote in the CurveDAO to boost the incentives given to Yearn's Pools. A positive feedback loop giving Yearn better incentives for users and more Curve tokens.**The Yearn Backscrather vault resulted in a higher TVL**


**In Comes Convex**

As always read the docs for better understanding:

https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/why-convex

Convex allows users to receive the boosted rewards of staking in Curve without locking up/owning any CRV tokens. It accumuklated so much CRV that it overtook Yearns position in just 14 days.

Convex also allows users to instead stake their CRV tokens and recieve a liquid version of veCRV - the Convex Curve Token (**cvxCRV**). 

Since Convex is also a DAO, they also have a voting locked token, vote locked Convex (**vlCVX**) which allows holders to dictate which way the DAO uses its veCRV to vote.


**Bribing**

August of 2021 - After seeing how successful curve rewards were for getting liquidity, Andre Cronje released a platform to bribe veCRV holders to vote certain ways. For example, veCRV owners who vote for Abracadabra will receive a bonus paid out in Spell.

But it gets deeper.

Similar to Bribes, Convex has Votium.

Votium Docs - 
https://docs.votium.app/

Which allows Governance Tokens/DAOs to bribe vlCVX holders to vote a certain way.


**How It Works In Practice**

Look no further than Frax and their fractional-algorithmic stablecoin pools and Abracadabra's MIM. Without increasing their budgets they were able to increase their liquidity compared to the simple direct liquidity mining incentives.


https://twitter.com/crypto_condom/status/1463589085486923778?s=20

&gt;fraxfinance has allocated $839M to the $CRV ecosystem. 
The $2m bribe $FRAX paid to Votium gets paid to voters who vote for their pool. Since FRAX uses their own vlCVX to vote for the FRAX pool, they earn their bribe back + $5 of CRV/CVX rewards for every $1 of bribe spent.



*Sidenote:[ MakerDao has actually started implementing certain aspects of Frax for DAI.](https://twitter.com/samkazemian/status/1455616788050296833?s=20)* It's interesting to see how the builders of DeFi work together to create a better ecosystem. 

**Future of The Curve Wars**

It's not really a Curve War anymore. Yearn and its competitor, StakeDAO, have since conceded to Convex. Yearn recently began delegating its veCRV to convex to achieve higher yields.

However since the DeFi 2.0 system has emerged this year. Tokemak uses a similar mechanism to Curve. Owners of Tokemak token are able to direct liquidity to different pools. 

TOKE may play a big part in getting Liquidity for new Tokens.

[Here is an interesting post from the Tokemak Team regarding the future of DAOs](https://medium.com/tokemak/the-evolution-of-daos-1692509bbb41)


The Idea of ""Protocol Owned Liquidity"" is a massive leap forward in Dao Tokenomics and was pioneered by OlympusDAO. They have already entered the Curve War battlefield by accepting CVX in exchange for OHM Bonds and are launching a new Branch - Redacted Cartel - in order to get a larger CRV ownership.

[A podcast with 0xSami concerning a new branch of OlympusDao - RedactedCartel.](https://rss.com/podcasts/agorapod/333233/)



**Value of Liquidity Directing Tokens**

CRV, CVX, and TOKE, are all important in the DeFi ecosystem. It's obvious that DAOs owning these tokens will be important in the future. And DeFi 2.0, for the most part, seems to be concerned with the interactions between DAOs as opposed to regular folks. 

I just thought it would be interesting to give a little post about the developments of **The Curve War** and who the future players may be.",2021-12-06 06:43:58

ryuk_luvs_apples,"You got a point right here. Investing in a DAO would actually make the investment even more valuable. I believe that everyone would be willing to do that, and to participate in the decision making of the a project. 

Those are a few decent DAOs, the one you mentioned, MakerDAO, Bit DAO, and New Order have got some good potential. I'm personally planning to invest on the upcoming offering on New Order on MISO this Thursday.",2021-12-08 04:21:37
swap_catz,This doesn't have to do with MakerDAO at all. It's really for corporations who want to generate dollar tokens backed by treasury reserve assets. The term stablecoin is wildly misused these days.,2021-12-08 05:00:41
MinimalGravitas,"&gt; They would have to control the majority of the staking power (nearly impossible)

No it's really not 'nearly impossible'. I don't know how much Algorand is staked, but let's assume all of it, with ALGO's current marketcap of about $10 billion you would need roughly $5 billion to have a majority control. For context there are single dApps on Ethereum that could achieve that. MakerDAO has a total locked value of almost $20 billion, but even more ridiculously UniSwap has a treasury of $7.2 billion, meaning that someone could raise a proposal to take over Algorand and the UniSwap governance community would theoreticallt have enough money to do so without even emptying their reserves.

Obviously if less than 100% of ALGO is staked then the theoretical cost to attack is proportionally lower.

I'm not saying I think that's likely to happen, I don't see any reason why an Ethereum dApp's community would bother attacking Algorand, but my point is that it's not enough to just assume no one will attack you.",2021-12-08 07:04:28

Kassius84BSS,"Hey,
I find the idea quite interesting to bring so stronger dUSD to USD.
But I'm also a fan of looking at what other projects have already done to solve a similar problem.

What I would be interested in now is how are other projects doing with decentralized stable coins like DAI? I have read briefly into the whitepaper at MakerDAO. It only understood that there are ""automatisms"" that ensure that DAI stays at $1. Does anyone have more experience with DAI and MakerDAO?

do you know MakerDao and Dai? They also offering decentralized loans via a Vault and a own decentralized stable coin. Sure MakerDao is based on the Ethereum blockchain but maybe the working mechanism are adoptable for DeFiChain?

I guess the Vault mechanism is not so unique. Maybe more or less unique on non Ethereum or BSC.

Why do you think the price for stock tokens is per design much higher than the oracle prices? I guess the demand for dTokens is just to high and less people are willing to mint new dTokens especially dUSD because of the the risk not the get enough dUSD back for a fair price to close there loans.

Could you please explain why do you think, an more or less inflationary dUSD won't also solve the high prices of dTokens?

Kind regards 👍",2021-12-12 14:14:51
uzyn,"You are right. The lag is going to present at most early decentralized token systems. See the early crazy days of DAI/MakerDAO.

Their early days problems are that DAI were traded below $1. The early days of MakerDAO started with very low interest rates, and kept raising it a few times to no avail, until the DAO proposed a really drastic move that significantly inflate the interest rates that it would start to push DAI up to $1.

There's however a slight difference of this vs DeFiChain currently. Collateral for DAI back then was merely ETH, which has no opportunity cost – no liquidity mining with high returns, no staking. 

DeFiChain's DFI though has a massive opportunity cost to let it sit in a vault. Users who mint dTokens with DFI are losing out a massive LM/staking opportunity cost. The action right now is very evident on that – DUSD is traded higher than $1.

DeFiChain's situation is the other way round, the lost opportunity cost needs to be compensated.

====

On lag, yes this is true. Any DAO-based systems would be lagging behind market condition. It is however still workable. As on the pinkpaper, the ultimate goal is to move this entirely to consensus to have auto feedback, thereby eliminating the lag.",2021-12-13 01:40:12

Allahambra21,"&gt;Algorithmic stablecoins are doomed to implode. If they ever drop below par they will enter a negative spiral that will destroy them. And they have no way to recover from that spiral.

Agree. 

I'm mostly holding out hope that I and everyone else are wrong and some super genious will invent some novel way to make it work. Its completely a pipe dream but would be insanely cool. 

&gt;""Overcollateralised decentralised stablecoins"" will work, the main issue is that unlike banks, these entities can only hold crypto assets. So they will always inherently be at more systemic risk than dollar denominated normal banks.

MakerDAO (that emits Dai) actually already is partly collateralised with regular bonds and other traditional financial instruments.

g_squidman,"Exactly. The problem isn't that they don't have reserves. It's that the reserves aren't what's US dollars or ""dollar equivalents."" In traditional banking, there are regulations on how much a bank needs to hold in reserve dollars - this regulation is NOT 100% matching reserves still, but there is a legal requirement.

The reason for this is because when there is a run on the bank, if they don't have enough reserve dollars, they can't pay out withdrawals, which exacerbates a crisis.

But if Tether runs out of reserve dollars to back their stablecoin, that doesn't mean people are unable to get their money back. It only means Tether loses its dollar peg. That's still a bad thing, but it's something that happens regularly to other stablecoins like DAI and nobody whines about MakerDAO reinventing the federal reserve.",2021-12-15 03:14:29

Did you just dodge the fact anyone can freely compete? With all the consequences it has on the ecosystem? You seem to have a hard time understanding the meaning and consequences of free competition. Need any help, maybe? 

""Solana has 1300 profitable validators and that list is growing daily.. the amount of solana a validator needs staked to break even is dropping daily and many of the nft daos are now popping up as sucessfull non funded validators""

And you dodged the fact they're funded by the company money rather than by the network itself. Why didn't you answer about that? To be more accurate, it's for way more than 90% of their rewards. As I said, they're rewarded by the company itself and can't profitably participate into the network without these funds. Finite funds. Which means it's unsustainable.

""Wouldn't take much for bsc to add a few more validators either and may be in there future to further decentralise""

It's a permissioned chain, adding a few more validators won't magically change the status of the chain. That's ridiculous, now. Stop shaming yourself, please, you're showing too much you don't understand anything you're saying.

""And no even bsc with 21 validators is still orders of magnitudes better then a ""bank"" as you put it but even then a banks shareholders votes are more evenly distributed then your so called layer 2 daos lmfao""

Hum... no, it's literally the same thing as a bank. It's currently less regulated, but only because states don't yet want to get onto this too harshly. It's a centralized company running a chain. The second a state wants to coerce it, it gets coerced. Just like a bank. Or maybe you're meaning Binance offer more profitable deals? If so, yeah, I agree, it's the principle behind any new competitor trying to get market shares: they need to compete by offering better deals. But the market will settle down and find a middle ground, with each competitor finding its spot.

plurBUDDHA,"Sorry for getting back to you a bit later but nxte gave some quality answers and I will just be adding onto what they said.

1) So yeah at first it can be perceived as annoying or inconvenient, the main thing that needs to be communicated with new users is that these are deposits and at no time do you lose those tokens. The only time it really becomes an issue is if you needed to spend a few CKB but that put you under the 62 limit and therefore requires you to remove your cell from the network. I am not sure if DOT has this cost as a deposit or a real cost but CKB it will always be a deposit, so you never actually lose those coins. So there is nothing stopping a user currently from having to deposit a large amount of money should the price hit $1, the goal of the network is also to push devs to innovate ways so things cost less as time goes on. Someone may figure out a way to write a cell script that costs 5ckb it just simply has not happened yet.

2) 1 CKBytes = 100,000,000 Shannons and a basic 2 input 2 output transaction costs .00000464 shannons iirc. So transaction fees wont even cost $1 until Nervos is $10,000. The fees will be even lower on L2 and yes Crypto .com overcharges by a lot.

3) Nxte already gave a complete answer anything else I would refer you to the NexiDAO page to read more about TAI. The only thing I can add is that Nexis is a copy of MakerDAO so it functions almost identically.

4) I agree with nxte NFT's should be able to be ""destroyed"" to recieve the deposit back. I use quotations because I do not think the artwork itself gets destroyed but the cell used to hold the artwork on the network is removed. The artwork should be like a simple .jpg file and its data stored in the cell on the Common Knowledge base. Also as nxte pointed out L2 will become the common holding place for data as the network utilizes Godwoken more. So a lot of the deposits that we currently see will either be largely reduced on L2 or become non-existent. 

As the network develops and matures we should see L1 as more of a safehaven for data rather than the main storage layer. I think the best analogy is the Common Knowledge Base (CKB) will become a large library of scripts, both private and public. Wallets with large holdings will be safely secured in cells on L1, also things like NFT's may take up some space. L2 will be used for the majority of the networks functionality though so many of the risks with deposit costs will be minimalized as L2 becomes more commonplace for network activity.",2021-12-16 03:46:50

Martin1209,"Guilty - I've been into crypto far longer than I have been into silver, as I see the same appeal for both as a scarce commodity!

&gt;I only would bring apes to a discussion how such system could look like…and how we minimize some issues of crypto…..it could also be a new system (from apes for apes)

Agreed, I definitely see a use for it in collateralised lending on chain, the premise is already set of course, but there would be benefits to bringing it on chain assuming it is done properly.

&gt;One of my ideas would be to digitalize physical silver by QR Codes on every coin or bar

I worry that this would not 'bring it on chain' as such, and that the actual solution would be not much of a step ahead of what currently exists, ie audited vaults, just they would write this to a particular chain and be associated with a particular token as opposed to the existing auditing process. Counterparty risk is always an issue with such things, like we've seen with the current system where there are multiple owners for the same piece of silver, there would be nothing to stop this happening with a crypto token if not sufficiently audited. 

It is happening though as you say, and it is a step in the right direction/some would say inevitable. It would have to be done within a strict framework to ensure the current system isn't just replicated 'on chain'. See below from MakerDAO who are onboarding real world assets but bear in mind the caution of this approach, and this whole process has been ongoing for years with relatively little 'locked value' to show so far.

Well, no. DAI is the 4th largest stable and it's controlled by MakerDAO, backed mostly by ETH though admittedly it's too reliant on USDC as backing right now (but improving). Then there are about a million other DAO-based stables that aren't reliant on a central authority. MIM is one of my favorites right now. 

There are even stables that aren't pegged to any fiat currency like RAI so they're 100% decentralized.

MerkleChainsaw,"Nobody knows where Ethereum's market cap will top out, but generally market caps for cryptocurrencies and equities are incomparable.

Mastercard stock, for example, is worth the present value of future profit that Mastercard is expected to make, which is considerably less than the value of Mastercard's network. To see this, imagine that Mastercard permanently changed to a non-profit organization run by the ""Mastercard Foundation"" and charged fees to break even over time. It's stock would be worthless but the network itself would be even more valuable than it is today.

Or to think of it another way, imagine crypto was like the oil industry. ETH's market cap would be more like the earth's oil stock (worth over $100 trillion) and it would be inappropriate to compare it to the value of the earth's oil companies (with less than 3 trillion market cap).

Sylv__,"Les stablecoins, c'est très large ! Si je devais résumer avec ma connaissance (mais en cherchant ""stablecoin types"" on trouve beaucoup de détails), on a :
1. Les stablecoins émis par une entreprise (centralisé), supposément backé par exemple par USD, EUR, de l'or, etc. Ce sont par exemple USDT (émis par Tether), USDC (émis par Circle), BUSD et USDP (émis par Paxos). Parmi les stablecoins centralisés, certains sont plus transparents que d'autres.
2. Les stablecoins dits algorithmiques, backés par ""du vent"". Je connais mal le sujet, mais c'est je pense le cas d'UST qui est backé par LUNA. Ici, il n'y a pas de collatéral en jeu. Mais je connais mal donc je ne vais pas m'étendre.
3. Les stablecoins avec collatéral crypto, on retrouve par exemple DAI ou LUSD. Ici, le risque est moins de faire confiance à une entité tiers (Tether, Circle...), mais plutôt d'être confiant que les smart contracts sont fiables, et que le collatéral est sain. Par exemple, MakerDAO (émetteur de DAI) accepte l'USDC et le WBTC en collatéral pour l'émission de DAI, qui sont des tokens centralisés et de facto sujets à régulation. Liquity (émetteur de LUSD) n'accepte que ETH comme collatéral, est n'est donc pas directement sensible à des décisions du législateur.

Tout ça pour dire, quand on parle de stablecoin, c'est très large. Le fait que je veuille sortir d'USDT ne veut pas du tout dire que je veux sortir des stablecoins, au contraire je pense que certains d'entre eux sont un excellent hedge contre une chute du marché !",2021-12-21 21:48:02

TerraUSD (UST) is an algorithmic stablecoin, which means the cost of minting is equal to the face value of the minted stablecoins. It uses LUNA, Terra’s native cryptocurrency, as a reserve asset.

a_stonk_a_day,"Compreendo que sejas conservador como tal esta sugestão é focada nisso mesmo e não uma sugestão aleatória: cripto, nomeadamente stablecoins, moedas que seguem o valor do dólar e que removem o factor volatilidade que é habitualmente o maior entrave à utilização de crypto para quem não se move nesse mundo.

Juros de 5-10% ao ano em soluções de centralized finance (CeFi) como Nexo ou Celsius, para depósitos de stables como USDC e BUSD, ambas moedas emitidas por organizações centralizadas e com histórico de cooperação com os reguladores.

Juros de 10-20% ao ano em soluções de finanças descentralizadas (DeFi) como Curve, MakerDAO e Anchor Protocol, para depósitos de stablecoins completamente descentralizadas (Ex.: UST, DAI)  que também não são emitidas por entidades centrais como as mencionadas anteriormente. O nível de conhecimento para esta estratégia é um pouco mais elevado mas os retornos e a segurança também o são.

Chapo_Rouge,"Well, I have been in DeFi for some time I guess.  


USDT is kind of the black duck, backing of USDT has been discussed at lenth, it does seems backed 1:1 by dollars, maybe by other means but this carries risk.  


DAI carries smart contract risk from MakerDAO and USDC risk. That said, it's very established by now as a good stablecoin.  


USDC carries risk from its centralized issuers (Circle/Coinbase) meaning your USDC can in theory be frozen by Circle",2021-12-24 01:07:56
ironmagnesiumzinc,"What do you mean by ""Even though MakerDao claimed their code is open source, it is not accessible to the public. Their portfolio-backed assets are intransparent""?

steadyhandhide,"One regret was selling a bunch of random alts into BTC sometime in early 2021. I really don’t care about those projects, but in hindsight it would have been wiser to wait  longer than I did. My philosophy late 2020 was to buy random small lots of alts, e.g. Loopring, Chainlink, MakerDAO, Tezos, Compound, Uniswap, etc. in preparation for “alt season”. Some were dogs and still haven’t really done much, but others were doing pretty good when I sold them, and then proper exploded after I sold. 

Nothing wrong with putting some money in your pocket while looking for the next opportunity. Crypto does offer some crazy gains during a bull run, but there are thousands of other markets out there where someone can make money with some planning and discipline. Do not think that this was (or is) your “one shot” at living a decent life. That mindset is toxic. It prevents you from finding more practical ways of earning money and pushes you into high risk/low reward situations at the worst of times.

Good luck.",2021-12-24 03:04:49

Summum,"I try to have my fundamental positions in protocols that have high value capture without additional friction. I avoid protocols that are reliant on fees to be worth something. Theses will get forked and lose steam over time. Eg MakerDao vs Abracadabra/Spell.

Eg.

\- All layer 1 chains except some Cosmos chains seem to capture a lot of value from the token utility.

\- Tokens wich have high value accrual from their utility in the protocol. $luna burn &amp; mint mechanism, $rune use as bond security VS TVL

jawni,"I'm talking about MakerDAO (DAI) specifically but this could apply to any over-collaterallized lending protocol.

Bear market driving down the collateral value and driving up the price of DAI is what has caused the biggest liquidation events.

Page 9 and 10 of this report actually cover this quite extensively: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06389.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06389.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We find that all of the  
four lending platforms are sensitive to the price decline of ETH. For  
example, an immediate 43% decline of the ETH price (analogous to  
the ETH price decline on the 13th of March, 2020), would result in  
up to 1.07B USD collateral to become liquidatable on MakerDAO.  
To our surprise, although Aave V2 and Compound follow similar  
liquidation mechanisms and have similar TVL, Aave V2 is more  
stable to price declines in terms of liquidatable collateral. By manually inspecting, we find that this is because Aave V2 users prefer  
adopting a multiple-cryptocurreny collateral. Hence, the positions  
in Aave V2 are less likely to become liquidatable due to the price  
decline of a single cryptocurrency.",2021-12-27 01:54:55

nikola_j,"&gt;Defi will be back - but it will need a perfect storm

I believe you're only talking about DeFi tokens here, right? Because I haven't seen DeFi as a space slowing down in any way, it's just that the tokens are down bad. And I guess they'll recover at some point, though I also see the problem in most DeFi tokens being governance voting tokens with no other mechanisms or use cases.

&gt;\- We need one roll up with all dapps that are right now on ETH mainnet --&gt; one composable roll up that allows you to use all the applications you know. Right now, there are too many apps missing because they are spread over the different execution layers. 

This would be great, though not sure if it'll happen in the next year. L2s are just starting to compete for users, so don't think it's likely that we see a clear winner as soon as 2022, especially given that they all have a lot of development to handle first (e.g. Arbitrum and Optimism are still throttled afaik, while zk-rollups have just started with generalized dapps support).

&gt;I guess Maker / DAI issuance is also a must have, I think there was news/ rumours about AAVE also issuing DAI, if that happens, it could work as well, but I guess you get my point. Lending/ borrowing + yield farming / liquidity mining

Just adding info on your Maker and Aave points:

Aave wants to have Aave v3 on all the chains and they have a ""wormhole"" feature built into v3, that allows users moving positions between chains seamlessly. This will effectively enable quick wormholing for DAI, too. Though there are a number of other quick-bridging protocols that are picking up steam, too (e.g. Celer, Hop).

MakerDAO itself already has an [official Dai bridge to Arbitrum](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/official-dai-token-bridge-now-live-on-arbitrum-one/10438/11), for example. Moreover, they plan to introduce actual Maker Vaults and Dai minting on L2s in Q1 or Q2 from what I know.

&gt;Liquidity mining could also be sparked by RU-tokens. I guess we will need incentives to kick start liquidity on the different RU and of course a mix of application tokens and RU tokens would be huge.

I'm not personally sold on L2s having tokens, but I guess we'll see, not saying it's not likely or anything like that. Incentives are definitely needed in either case, especially given how much alternative L1s are pouring out in order to get users. And it may actually be the case we see a new round of [$UNI incentives](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xe377d2b8e245404c42a6892be4232e017bf44b7fcc2e72426aa95ea5a4e01783) as a big catalyst.

Maswasnos,"&gt; If a bunch of people start buying erc20 usdc, it won't. Why? Stablecoin has a special treatment on exchange??

A concept called arbitrage keeps stablecoin values in check. Theoretically, you can always redeem a stablecoin for $1 of value either in USD (USDC, USDT) or in crypto (DAI, LUSD, MIM). 

Because of this, it incentivizes arbitrage between large exchanges and the entities issuing stablecoins. Arbitrage is basically this:

1. Lots of people sell DAI on Coinbase for some other asset, and the price drops a bit because of supply/demand
2. A whale notices DAI is only $.995 on Coinbase and buys up a few million dollars-worth, bringing the price back to $1
3. That whale then takes the DAI back to MakerDAO and redeems it for slightly more crypto than he paid to acquire the DAI on coinbase, more than covering the transaction fees

The same applies in reverse when the price is over $1.

1. Lots of people buy DAI on an exchange, and the price goes to $1.01
2. A whale uses a ton of crypto to mint a few million DAI at MakerDAO
3. The whale takes his fresh DAI to that exchange and sells it all at $1.01, driving the price back down

Obviously you need a ton of money to make this worthwhile, but if you did this with $10million on a 1-cent difference, you'd get about $100k in one round of arbitrage. Then you automate this process with a bot and you make absurd sums of money. Repeat for every stablecoin out there and every exchange with decent volume.",2021-12-29 01:02:07

takethewealth,"Doesn't really make sense to look for advice from people who don't understand crypto.  Don't listen to friends who think crypto is a ponzi and who haven't made millions from crypto like you have.  They should be taking advice from you.  

 Also no one can tell you what's right for you.  Yoire I'm Canada so not sure if this applies, but in the US, if you borrow against your assets, thats not a taxable event.  That's one of the big ways the rich get rich, they borrow against they're appreciating assets without selling them and being able to use those borrowed funds for their life or other investments. Thats why real estate is very popular and a lot of very wealthy people created their wealth through RE.

 I'm not sure what digital assets you have, but you can use something like makerdao or liquity, or rari to put up your assets as collateral and borrow against them without realizing a taxable event.  This is assuming you're using the ethereum network and you understand how to use smart contracts/different protocols.  Make sure not to borrow to much and stay within a safe collateralization ratio so you don't get liquidated.  Do.Not.Get.Liquidated.",2021-12-29 05:28:02

frank__costello,"There's two main protocols for ETH-collateralized lending in Ethereum DeFi

* MakerDAO: Interest rates are pretty low, 0.5% for the ETH-C pool, but you need to keep a pretty healthy colateralization ratio. This is also a very old and low-risk protocol
* Liquity: Interesting thing is there's no interest fees: you incur a USD-denominated fee when you open your loan, and pay an ETH-denominated fee when closing your position.",2021-12-29 21:59:43

* **Permissionless:**  Jeder kann partizipieren. Es gibt keine Sanktionen gegen bestimmte Länder (siehe US&lt;-&gt;Iran) oder Ethnien. 
* **Open:** Als Entwickler kann ich selbst meine Bank programmieren und andere Entwickler haben offene Schnittstellen zu dieser Bank. So ist die Bank (siehe MakerDao, Yearn) als solches nur ein fundamentales Baustück auf das andere mit neuen Utilities (z.B. Lending/Borrowing a la Aave, Compound) aufbauen können. Nun ersetze ""Bank"" mit anderen Domänen wie Versicherung oder Logistik und du bekommst offene Zensure-Resistente Netzwerke mit Utilities.
* **Dezentral:** Hier gibt es viele Vorteile. Unter anderem: 
   * Es gibt keine Zensur. Man kann es höchstens mit viel Aufwand auf Staatenebene verbieten. Ob das Erfolg hat für das jeweilige Land wenn sich Blockchains durchsetzen bleibt fraglich. Man stelle sich die Frage was mit Ländern passierte die das Internet blockiert haben.
   * Transaktionen auf der Blockchain sind resistent gegen Korruption.
   * Eine zentrales Unternehmen (z.B. Facebook) hat keine Kontrolle über mich als Individuum.
