WeakEmu8,"All your questions have been answered a million times on hundreds of blogs, YouTube videos and here.

Keep researching. Lookup solar power calculators, power assessments, towing a toad, boondocking, RV maintenance, full timing, how generators work, how 12v systems work, how RV electrical works, etc - you have a big learning curve ahead of you.

One thing I'll point out, you're looking to finance a depreciating asset and live in it full time when it's designed to be used a few times a year. Maintenance will be required, so either learn to do it yourself, or be prepared to pay for it.

Financially full timing isn't necessarily any better than renting, it's just a different way to live, with different trade-offs. Being aware of those tradeoffs in advance will help.",2021-02-01 00:12:47

lostandfound1,"Hey mate, old timer here (I've got 8 years on you!).

I've been getting in to personal finance lately, so can share some broad guidelines that I've read or listened to on podcasts. Can't say I've been this disciplined myself, but I personally want to get better at this stuff so I can maximise my future opportunities. Don't take this as expert advice, I'm just some schmuck on a learning curve like you. 

Emergency fund: you have $12k saved. That's a great achievement. Make that your emergency fund. Needs to be enough to last you 4-6 months if you lose your job and can't find another quickly. Sounds like a very good amount.

Savings; most guides say aim for 20% of income (post tax). Your after tax pay is about $42500, meaning you might be able to target $8500/yr so $700/ month. You can do more if you go full-monk-style, but that's down to your priorities and needs. Could impact the low stress lifestyle, so keep it all in perspective. 

Investments. Well, that's the tricky part. It's not actually tricky, but it depends on you, your goals, what you're after. #thisisnotfinancialadvice If you want property, look into the 'first home super saver scheme'. It's a way of making extra contributions to super for a deposit, then taking them out when you are about to buy. It's apparently good for minimising tax on capital gains and making sure your savings are earning interest. Downside is the rules are complicated (because it involves government policy) but apparently it's a good way of getting that deposit. Haven't done it myself, but apparently it stacks up if you are keen on property and willing to deal with a bit of paperwork.

If you want to go for an investment portfolio, you could contribute more to super. It's good for tax, but you pointed out there is a massive downside in not being able to touch it until 67yo. For me personally, that rules it out until I hit late 50s-early60s. You could do the same outside super and it would be liquid (ie you can access the funds if you want to buy a house, start a family etc)

Better option is to get a low fee brokerage account and invest in indexed ETFs. To keep it simple, look at Vanguard and their passive ETF tracking the asx300. #notfinancialadvice

Look in to other options as well, but decision paralysis is your worse enemy here. If you find a low fee, passive, index tracking ETF and want to go down the 'invest money in shares' route, just start throwing that 20% of income in there. Look in to other ETFs, then maybe stocks as you learn, but if your index and fees are good and low, it's a great option. 

Google money smart compound interest calculator, put your deposit and regular contributions in and throw a 10% interest rate compounding monthly and see what your net wealth might do. That's a good approximation of the share market growth, #notingthatpastperformanceisnotanindicatoroffutureperformance

That sets up some good starts. Get that bubbling away in the background, then go figure out what you want out of all this. Career, retirement, financial independence, travel, whatever. The good financial setup should be there to support your goals.",2021-02-01 19:01:53

I had one job once where I never really ""got"" it. The training was inadequate, we were never shown how to use basic equipment, coworkers refused to help with things I could not physically do because I didn't even have access to the systems to complete them. The managers were happy with my work and wanted to give me a title promotion. When I asked about training they said, ""What do you mean?"" (as in, there was no training for this position that required a ton of knowledge I didn't have). That was definitely my most uncomfortable job and I quit shortly thereafter.

Sneaky_Jim,"Are you settled on going 20% down? You can also get a high ratio mortgage (a default insured mortgage) for 5 or 10% down. I think there's strong arguments for either way. High ratio is much more risky, but will get you a higher ROI on your downpayment over a few years. 

Regardless, I'm not sure that putting your entire savings into one piece of real estate co-owned by your dad is the best strategy. From a returns perspective you probably won't even beat equities, especially when considering compound growth, unless housing market goes up, which you can't really count on. Plus, all this equity is illiquid, locked into the property, and you could end up having to write a cheque to get out, should the real estate market tank. You definitely don't want that. 

I think it's best to stay liquid and in ETFs. Stock picking is a loser's game unless you have information or strategies unmatched by the rest of the market, which I bet you don't. You'll learn all the theory behind this if you take finance in uni. The ETFs you've mentioned above are pretty decent though for a young guy who's able to take lots of risk.

dazplot,"The short answer, as someone who was in your position but ended up working for Japanese companies, is that there probably isn't any way to reach true business level without throwing yourself into a sink-or-swim immersive environment. Some highly self-motivated and/or gifted people may be able to do it, but I think it pretty uncommon.

That said, ""business level"" can mean different things. My jobs have required meeting with clients and joining conference calls, taking minutes, writing reports, stuff like that. It was a brutally steep learning curve. If you're in engineering or IT, it may be enough just to communicate with your team and focus on a specific range of vocabulary. Both of these things are business level, but they are fairly different. Also, there are jobs out there that mix English and Japanese, which would be a more comfortable learning environment.

Again, though, if you're like me you won't learn how to talk about finance and contract law and shipping terms and budget meetings etc. if you're not repeatedly forced to, so just ask yourself if you really want to take that path. There's no harm in letting English be your business language and Japanese be your fun socializing language.",2021-02-03 20:28:25
investorinvestor,"In the world of Existing Monetary Theory (EMT), your thesis would probably hold some water. Unfortunately, since the 2008 crash we've been living in some sort of bizarro monetary environment, which I'll refer to as the world of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). Allow me to begin my rebuttal using your post as a jumping-off point: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And here lies the problem, interest rate cannot go into the negative because people and companies would rather withdraw money from the bank and hold them in the form of banknotes which would NOT carry the negative component. 

If you look at vast swaths of the Eurozone, many Euro member countries are not just at negative rates on the central bank rate, but some are even negative across the entire yield curve. The reason why 100-year govt bonds gained prominence (infamy?) was because everything else was already negative; so if you wanted that geographic exposure, 100-year govies were the best you were going to get. 

But I digress; back to the point. If you study the savings rates of the Euro member countries currently with negative nominal interest rates, their savings rate have actually gone UP since negative rates started. This flies completely in the face of EMT and in fact common sense itself, but that's in fact what has happened in our MMT world. The hindsight justification is that people are expecting things to get worse, therefore they are even more motivated to build their rainy day fund - in the expectation that they'll soon have to hunker down and hibernate. Of course, this may not be directly attributable to negative rates alone - LTRO and its descendants can potentially share a lot of that blame as well. But it doesn't change the fact that negative interest rates doesn't automatically = people won't save. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How will they avoid financial armageddon? The answer is by artificially manufacturing enough inflation to move away from the Zero area and thus have the Interest rate follow suit and move away from the Zero Lower Bound.

This is what the ECB has been trying to do for the past 8 years. Remember Draghi's ""Whatever It Takes""? That was 2012. It still hasn't caused the inflation we were hoping for yet, and 8 years is an eternity - both in markets and at the individual lifespan level. For reference, the Great Depression (by its longest definition) lasted 12 years, and was long enough to write a scar into history itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's not important because the goal is always the same: inundating consumers with cash in the hope that they feel rich enough to start consuming again (acting on the impulse of purchasing again) and stop saving/investing (being fearful of the future and behaving in a risk averse manner) 

Well, the counterpoint to that is: that's exactly what we've done for the past decade. It may not have been helicopter money (which actually happened in 2020, btw); but our central banks have gone to some gymnastic-level lengths with nothing much to show for so far - except the longest bull market in stocks in history. 

Why might this be the case? Because when entrepreneurs, the building block of the economy, are not confident enough that they will turn a profit on their investments, they won't borrow to invest. So all that extra money flows into either 1) non-productive ""expenses"" (vs ""assets"") (e.g. a second home, speculative stocks, pipe dreams) or 2) higher-yielding investments from a risk:reward perspective (i.e. justifying higher prices for lower-yielding investments). If the expected value from starting a business is negative, why would you bother? You'd just invest in something else that would yield a less-than-satisfactory return. 

As a result, GDP growth slows. With lower productivity output, companies have to reduce expenses. Salaries/jobs get cut, people spend less, and the cycle perpetuates. This is evident in the ever-declining velocity of money. The lynchpin of Keynesian countercyclical policy is animal spirits, and if you can't poke the bull hard enough to chase the bear away, the whole theory falls apart. 

Hence, the easy money policy of the last 10 years (around the world) have shown that simply inundating consumers with cash only raises prices in isolated pockets of the economy, while leaving the rest untouched. Hence the term ""K-shaped recovery"". We've actually seen this before btw, Japan has pretty much been like this since the early 2000s. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As said earlier G-20 governments/Central Banks will be forced to manufacture some inflation and that would carry the Treasury bonds rate upwards as well (because savers would not bid over each other anymore for the privilege of lending to the Government at 0.25% because that would not protect them against inflation anymore) 

First of all, governments/central banks do not feel at all obligated/compelled to manufacture inflation for the purpose of carrying the Treasury rate above the ZLB. It is simply not their top-of-mind concern. The fact that so many govts have already allowed negative rates shows that there are other concerns which take precedence over simply having a positive central bank rate. (still remember Trump insisting on negative rates?) 

Second, savers have in fact bid over each other for exactly the privilege of earning a pittance - because they think that rates might go further negative. Just take a look at the recent Aussie issue at negative rates - demand far outstripped supply. TSLA is another current example - at its current valuation, you'd be earning a pittance ROI even if you were right on the money; yet very intelligent people still champion it. The problem isn't inadequate absolute returns; the problem is even worse relative returns. 

&amp;#x200B;

I could actually write an entire essay on why in our world today the influence of MMT has probably superseded EMT, and how the dismal science has booked a holiday to Oz and doesn't intend to come back. 

It's a mistake to think that post-Covid was the start of the Great Monetary Experiment (coincidentally ""GME""); we've actually already been living in it since at least 2012. How else can you explain the joyless bull run (where every year is a calamity); ultra-low volatility (supported by telegraphed central bank expectations); the Central Bank put (markets being rescued by 2012's ""Whatever It Takes"", 2016's PBOC capital controls, 2018's Powell Calm, and 2020's ""Spend up to your limit, and then spend a bit more""). Markets in the last decade have been as far away from *laissez-faire* as you can define it, and if Hayek could see this he would be rolling in his grave so fast that you could hook him up to a generator. Keynes on the other hand would probably be rolling in reverse from victory. 

You should be commended on a great effort, there is no doubt about that. But unfortunately everyone at the highest level of finance has already thought about this at least once, and reality has proven that EMT no longer holds true. Welcome to the new world of MMT.",2021-02-03 23:21:53

&amp;#x200B;

You posted on a career advice sub and spent the entire post discussing your depression.  It's time to look after your mental health.  You have some of the same problems many of your peers have (Graduating 2 years later than you predicted isn't a bad thing. Progress isn't a straight line and you will take plenty of 2 year detours in various ways in your life).  You've got a mental health condition and we're in the middle of a pandemic that makes a lot of those issues worse. It would be a good idea to prioritize mental health (seeing a doctor and therapist immediately).  Your situation does not make me feel hopeless, so if it makes you feel hopeless, that's an indication your perception is worse than your reality. 

&amp;#x200B;

On to the career side of things:  You have a bachelor's degree in finance and some work experience. That's plenty enough to get hired for a decent-paying job.  You aren't trapped, you aren't behind the curve, and you aren't unqualified. You're good to go!  You can work in any of thousands of jobs that simply require a college degree, or you can get a job in your actual field. Sure, you'll need to play the numbers game by applying to lots of jobs and interviewing until you get hired, but that's what we all did.  

This isn't really a tough love post, despite how it sounds. If I had to sum up the advice, it would be this:  Your depression is making the situation seem worse than it is. If you address the depression, you'll find you're actually in pretty good shape to take a step back, breathe a little, apply for some jobs and see what you like doing. We have way more time than we think. Many of us think our careers are a big race where every month counts, but it's just not true. The company I built helps thousands of people find a job every year. I see this at every career level.  People rush out the gates after college, they compare themselves to everyone, then they eventually realize everyone around you is just focused on their own careers, their own doubts, their own stuff.  Your career is going to be fine.  Depression doesn't go away when you get a job.  Take care of yourself, and your career will be waiting for you!",2021-02-09 00:18:12

ImADaveYouKnow,"Partially yes. There's a lot more to it than just smooth transfers of crypto. Crypto currencies are only one small part of blockchain technology these days. Take DeFi coins for example.

The coins you see that are DeFi coins actually support an application. DeFi means ""Decentralized Finance"" so these kinds of blockchains do what a bank would do, but without a company behind it. So, lets say you want to take out a loan. You could fill out a ""smart contract"" on one of the DeFi platforms to take out a loan. Then, according to the parameters set on the contract, you pay it back or lose the asset you staked (usually in the form of a down payment). All of this happens without any human intervention.

The ""coins"" associated with these DeFi dapps are what power the transactions. The machines that process these transactions are ""paid"" in the currency of the platform. As the platform grows, the coins appreciate in value.

Polkadot provides an easy framework to build and host these kinds of applications. So instead of a developer having to design a blockchain from scratch, then program what the contracts should look like, then provide security protocols, etc. Polkadot handles all of that. Now developers only have to worry about their specific use case.

It's going to open a lot of doors for new and existing blockchain applications while also lowering the learning curve of entry.",2021-02-09 07:33:02

I am not a 100% familiar with the exact decks that existed in that meta. However, in the current meta, Rogues can use Lurrus for free, and it’s still a very good inclusion despite the nerf. Pre-nerf it’d have been absolutely broken, so I disagree that most aggro decks wouldn’t find use for it.

BeepBoop6765,"Hey there,

Thank you for sharing this with us.

I’m assuming you are UK based.

There are so many things I want to tell you, but it will take me an eternity to write, but here he go:

1) I’m actually having some therapy as well. NHS waiting times are indeed crazy so I’m paying for it myself, but it’s costing me £100 per session... how fucked up is that?

2) The times after study and before finding a career can be very daunting. I perfectly understand. I know you tired to get into uni twice already, but going from high school to industry is a huge step. I would strongly advise you try uni again, but this time you will hopefully have someone by your side (see following point).

3) Being bad at maths is relative. You might not be good enough for a high level technologic job, but in finance, there are some good entry jobs, and you don’t need to be super good at maths, particularly accounting.

4) I am a perfectionist at heart, and it affects my life significantly. I cannot get rid of it, but I can steer it to the positive spectrum, which actually makes me very proud of being one.

5) Automation will take over low wage jobs, and I am sorry to tell you that I currently work on automating something that people hire warehouses upon warehouses of poor Indian people to sit there 12 hours a day to do every day. I actually have quite the strong opinion on this, so I would prefer not to publicly state it :P but I invite anyone who is interested to have an interesting debate on this to let me know :)
But in summary OP, I want to tell you that by the time a machine takes over your job, you would have already progressed to the next stage of your career. Humans progress faster than machines, so you will always be ahead of the curve, specially you being very young.

6) don’t predict homelessness in 20 years, come on... the world is changing so fast everyday that any prediction over 1 month is almost pointless. You could be homeless tomorrow or never.

7) You are not a mistake, you are not a worthless  piece of shit! I know you feel like that, so I will just have to show you otherwise :)

If you need anyone to talk with, to listen to you and make you feel less lonely in these times, I am here any time any day! Don’t throw your life away for this! ❤️",2021-02-09 21:29:17

resilienceisfutile,"My reason for calling it overrated was because the company holds many more cards than you do in terms of protection cards.  You do not necessarily keep YOUR job, but you keep A job at the company -- HR will help you once you return from parental leave (in Canada it is either parent or as a combination of the two for leave).  In my wife's job (her job is specialized), it is up to your reporting manager to keep the spot open and covered (her spot wouldn't fit a contractor well because learning curve and security) until you return if you can keep that spot.  My wife knows coworkers who have been replaced by new workers and are never seen in the same role after their mat leave is done, so they outright quit (lose any chance of a package) or work on another account which hearing the conversations is like starting all over with new managers, new environment, and no feeling of seniority.  The worst my wife has seen was a DBA being laid off the day after she returned; she called my wife to see if she had any leads or a spot on her account team and my wife was gutted at hearing this.  HR gives you resources to find another job within the company, a desk at a hotelling location, a desktop computer, turn in your laptop and cell phone, and start the countdown because you got 2 months starting now.  It happens when the company has 35,000+ people worldwide. 

So this is where some of the bending of the rules happen and her industry is not a lonely island as we have heard it from her university IT friends, my friends that I left in banking and finance (it is bad there as your job is instantly replaceable in the back office), and research.  You will get calls to put out fires, they will pick your brain, they will ask you to help and what do you say?  ""No, I am on leave.""  Unless you manager (or in the case of my wife, the client team requested her return to the account) is going to be out there to protect you, your position could be jeopardized and you are at the mercy of the corporation.

Factory jobs like at Ford Canada, you can move up the chain a bit to a better spot on the line when you get back because unions will go to hell and back for you.  Pretty much any unionized job will keep you in your spot.  And teachers leave for a year the union is so strong and there are enough teachers in supply and as LTOs.  Smaller companies appreciate their workers more and you don't hear as many stories there.

If corporations like the types my wife and friends work for would guarantee a spot in the same role, then I would say, not overrated.  But laid off the day after you get back?  That is no protection at all and someone in each country maliciously complying with the rules.",2021-02-09 23:08:40

Although one of those degrees was general arts, I think it taught me more than my specialized finance one. It taught me to be rational and how to critically think. I feel that is why I am usually able to see the larger picture in most situations.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’ve been to a few continents, many bars, many festivals and shows, and many other adventures (I also definitely missed out on a ton too). But I always approached it with the financial cost in the back of my mind.

Nowadays I have begun to relax a little more when it comes to money. My investment accounts should pull in around 20k per year and I do continue to plan to grow that. But, the knowledge that I could theoretically work on minimum wage and live of my nest egg (comfortably) is awesome. I do not plan to live that way, but it gives me the option to.

The most important thing I can share is to develop a good work ethic. For every shit job I have had I am always genuinely shocked that some people routinely mail it in, show up late, give attitude to their superiors, etc. There is no secret - Show up, take pride in your work even if it sucks, say yes to everything, then go home and work on personal goals (or have fun). That one sentence has taken care of the rest of my life. No matter what the work is, if you feel it is beneath you - it isn’t. There is no shame in bagging groceries or mopping floors.


Judging by your post, you are missing the core concept of generating wealth. The vast majority will come from when you deposit in the account, not what the account generates (at least at the start). Get rich quick schemes exist, but only on the right tail of the bell curve. Meaning that are few and far between, and even moreso - just luck. Don’t rely on luck. Create as many opportunities as you can and luck will find it’s way to you in the little ways.",2021-02-09 23:15:39
scruffmgckdrgn,"My father was a bank manager who somehow managed to avoid ever teaching me anything about how to deal with money, and my mother is absolutely terrible with her money. I make about the same as you do, and started out in basically the same financial situation. My primary ""advantage"" over your situation is that I don't have kids, so I *can* spend a bunch of time figuring out how to use the program. 

The learning curve for YNAB is steep, and I can no longer say why, because I've figured it out. It's weird, and it may just be because like you I had basically no financial education, but I felt really stupid for maybe two months before I settled in and was comfortable using the program. That's not to say I can use it to its fullest extent, but I'm better off than I *was* earlier. I also still don't understand much of what ""most people"" understand about personal finance, and I learn this stuff pretty slowly. 

In numbers, I am up in net worth by a little over eleven thousand dollars since Jan 2020. Some amount of that will probably not be replicable post-COVID stimulus checks, but I only had two months on boosted unemployment, so a fair amount of it is me and the program. In terms of ""non-scale victories"", I have *very* little stress over my financial situation now, and that loss of anxiety is even better reward to me than the money. 

I found that the hardest speedbumps to get past were emotional; the anxiety I'd feel over fully *seeing* how bad my situation was was something I would avoid by *refusing to use the program* so that I no longer felt that anxiety. That fear was keeping me from improving my situation. 

I don't know how long you've been working on understanding YNAB, but I hope you can stick to it. I honestly believe you have more than enough intelligence to understand it, and that it will help you once you do. The barrier is probably fear, and if you can conquer that, you can vastly improve your life.",2021-02-09 23:25:48
agjios,"My credit union did the same thing. First off, they can't tell you your rate until they see the vehicle. A 2012 F-150 with 164,000 miles will have a different rate (or might not even get approved) compared to a 2019 Camry with 31,000 miles.

So, when I went to the dealership, I let them run my credit, in case anything fell through with the credit union, and to prove that I could be approved for the car that they were showing me. Once we agreed on a price, I went to the finance manager. The dealership couldn't beat my credit union rate, so the finance manager faxed some things back and forth with my credit union.

Aimlesskeek,"While CCRCs are a better option...Be wary, their finance model may encourage better conditions for the independent end of the spectrum and dumping patients once they are on the SNF side. 

Some CCRC’s front load the contract, shorting the funding for skilled care because SNF patients can’t advocate for themselves at community board meetings. The active adult community directs spending on their fun not recognizing the deferred maintenance, reduction in trained staffing, and antique computer systems will affect them as they decline into the dilapidated care they perpetuated.

Even better, the fee structure can create incentives to get rid of them at their most helpless.  Once our LO exceeded the number of years for a graduated % return in the contract, the CCRC admin team tried to have her committed to a distant and discredited facility behind our backs.

Manitcor,"That question is often a loaded one that starts with that and then goes but XX coin has this and XX coin has that so your coin should not exist. I am not really interested in that game if that is the goal here. Rather than bullet list, I will just provide what brought me to using Algo. 

I personally become aware of Algo about 5 months ago and had been following it a bit as one tends to when looking for another promising coin to invest in. I was first interested as I am a Boston area local and like to support things that are local. As I followed it more I learned that the project was founded by an Economist with a PHD in the field and works as a professor at MIT. This got me even more interested as ""tokenomics"" is often what makes or breaks a coin longer term and someone with a strong economics background (as opposed to software dev or marketing or other fields as so many coins are started/headed by) could really put in place some policies that make a coin more usable long term. 

It was at this point I bought my first bit of algo and just kind of let it sit, organically learning more about the protocol as news released. The network is interesting in that its looking at all the use cases developing for crypto and rather than trying to accommodate those use cases after the coin is popular the coin is designed from the ground up as an attempt to actually be a global financial network capable of actually serving the globe. This is becoming more common in newer coins as people have watched how having a protocol that leaves out important details like scaling for later can lock the coins progress as it becomes popular. I was somewhat skeptical about the claims being made however from using the technology in just moving coins around I think there is promise here on speed along. The protocol is capable of completing a transaction in mere seconds. As an example 2 days ago I moved a bunch of coins to a wallet, by the time I was done telling my wife about the move the funds were already in the walled, fully confirmed and ready to use. There may be other fast coins (I have heard of a few) but this is the first I have used myself and it is quite impressive. 

As I bought more ALGO I became more aware of the staking and how it worked, I stake multiple coins using the myriad of ways that are available from protocol level staking to soft staking provided by 3rd parties. Algo's interest system caught my eye due to its somewhat high return rate 7-7.5% but also the fact that it was unique in its protocol staking system, requiring no locking of coins and no long wait times to begin receiving awards. You are allowed to move your coins around at will and the staking system will automatically adjust your rewards on the spot, no 20-30 day rolling periods, no lock ups, no waits to unlock. 

Then while trying to buy some crypto on Kucoin I realized getting Fiat over there is a pain, and moving ETH based coins or BTC would cost a fortune relatively. This is where I discovered that a quickly growing number of exchanges work with Algo. Since then I have also started using my Algo as a float for moving money between exchanges. The fees are extremely low and the speed is so fast making it one of my favorite mediums of transfer at the moment (we will see how things go as the network grows). As of now, Algo is the only coin I regularly actually use for something that is not investing or trading (its just moving money but still doing that fast and cheap is a lot of utility on its own) and I have pushed more across the algo network in utility functions than I have all the other coins I have used combined. 

Finally as I got around to really reading the whitepaper and details I really appreciated how the coin's value is considered. Algo as a technology and as an economic tool is not designed to ""go to the moon"" like other coins. It is meant to have a level of stability and somewhat predictable price growth as to better facilitiate international finance transactioins, from something as small as a coffee (yes algo can do true mini and micro payment) all the way up to major international banks exchanges billions all at high speeds. As a matter of fact there are built in mechanisms to control price when it attempts to go parabolic like other coins. This is done to offset the volatility often seen in other coins as well as to try and prevent crashing back down lower than the previous mean (which can happen with those big spikes due to panic selling). Some people liken it to price manipulation, but its really all there in the white paper and I credit the strategy as to why algo's price action seems to be somewhat unique in the crypto world. 

There are other features I have yet to really dig into yet myself but they are all fairly interesting though I would also say fairly standard fare when it comes to this generation of coins:

* smart contracts (dex, liquidity pools, etc)
* tokenization of arbitrary items (other coins, stocks, physical assets, etc) 
* voting based governance

There are likely more features I have missed or poorly explained, but that is how I came around to really liking algo and hoping it has a future as a real utility in the world.

There are certainly a host of other coins that boast similar features, some on the market some in various stages of development. And algo is just one of multiple newer coins in my portfolio, though I will admit the recent bull run took algo from an average stake among the portfolio to one of my largest stakes out of all my coins. I just really hope the price stays more stable this time due to the lest volatile growth curve.",2021-02-10 23:21:02

LifelnDefault,"Having a professional background in finance helps from a learning curve perspective. Those with finance backgrounds have to put a little less effort into learning technicals relative to a pure career switchers that have never looked at a P&amp;L before.

I recruited amongst CFAs and CPAs and while they were able to get their foot in the door with banks quite easily, I don't believe they were materially better off than career switchers because cultural fit and personality are far more important than technical proficiency. A few classmates had significant M&amp;A and capital raising experience and they were by far the most sought after.

As every banker will say, technical proficiency is a ""check the box"". Johnson gives every IB candidate enough resources to ""check the box"" with every firm. At the end of the day, it comes down to cultural fit, being someone that bankers want to work with, and demonstrating interest in the career path.",2021-02-13 00:36:58
Temper03,"Same, I'm always amazed how people come into recruiting with such high hopes and (sometimes) specific targets and then when ocr throws them a curve, they still end up okay and rationalize it was the best move anyway.  Specifically a friend of mine was ""Manhattan MB or bust"" (didn't even consider BCG for whatever reason, super weird kid...) and whiffed on both interviews and skipped finance recruiting .  Now he's gonna work in a small fintech startup in Seattle that the career office helped him land and he just gushes over it.

&amp;#x200B;

A 1Y talking to him today would get this whole contrived story about how ""he always knew he wanted to work at a startup in fintech"" and how his MBA goals were clear from the outset and exactly to plan... they definitely weren't and it's super misleading to new students who get worried when things don't go to plan for them.",2021-02-13 03:37:22

_hiimalex,"It was a temp position for the peak season, but at the end I reached out to them hoping to get an offer for full time. They said they really enjoyed working with me and I'd be the first to get a call if finance and VP gave them the approval. It's been a couple weeks nice then, so I'm just trying to figure out next steps for my career.   
I unfortunately have not attempted any since passing exam P, not to make any excuses but the start of the pandemic put my family's small business to work and I ended up helping for several months full time.   


I used TheInfiniteActuary (TIA) for my study material for exam P and plan to use them again for FM. I noticed they have a ""technical course"" package that seems like it could be useful as well? 

Thank you so much for your insight. I guess I'm just scared that I'm too late or too far behind the curve to continue down this path. Good to know I'm not too late.",2021-02-13 14:16:10
Luminis_The_Cat,"Hi, I'm one of the co-op students that was involved with the Workday launch. I understand your struggle and there are inevitably things that will have changed for the worse, but overall, Workday is replacing a 25-year old, paper-based system. It had to be done eventually. There is a learning curve to it. I'm sorry that you had a negative experience, but there is also a lot of people, especially on the HR and Finance side, who really appreciated how easier things are for them now.

As with every large scale implementation, there are upsides and downsides. While your job may have gotten harder, other people's jobs may have gotten easier. Overall, I believe that switching to Workday is a good decision overall. Yes, learning a whole new system is tough. Yes, there will be a lot of confusion. But we cannot rely on old systems if we want to move forward.

P.S. I have a decent knowledge of Workday, feel free to PM me your questions and let's see if my drunk ass has any idea of what to do with them",2021-02-13 15:30:09
easy_c0mpany80,"I used to work for a bank here as  devops engineer, a bank no-where near as big as Barclays but well known and actually known for being a bit ahead of the curve in-terms of using cloud tech compared to other major banks who are often a bit slow and have a lot of tech debt. I changed job last year and was inundated with new role offers from many different firms including several of the ones I mentioned above. I actually spoke to a recruiter about an operations role at Barclays but passed on it as they are still using older and on-prem stuff for the next couple of years until they move into cloud (their cloud team is based down in Chester), also had initial chats/interviews at Morgan Stanley, Moodys and another bank but went with a much smaller firm in the end as the banks are quite slow to move and a lot were using Windows &amp; Azure but I much prefer working with linux &amp; AWS. I was doing between 3-5 interviews a week when I was job hunting and they were pretty all much well known firms and I was turning down lots of other opportunities. The company I work with now is related to finance and growing rapidly and they also offered me the exact salary I asked for without trying to haggle down which was nice.

I often seen mid-tier to senior dev roles advertised round here in the 5-65k region and some up to 75k. With the right CV and firm you can often push that higher too. I also get a lot of roles offered to me that are fully remote for London firms due to covid but as many companies have been 100% remote for almost a year now I would be surprised if it stays like this in the future.",2021-02-13 19:06:04

Improving hr and finance at the sacrifice of all end users in all other departments does not seem like a good balance. Implementing a system wide change to a general audience should be 1. Simple and 2. Fool proof (as much as possible) 3. Properly guided. Workday has not been this in the slightest. 

Dumping a steep learning curve to end users is never a good model. Yes were in academia we're all capable but the time we spend could be used on advancing research and projects rather than a practice in redundancy.",2021-02-13 21:18:57

Mewseido,"Congratulations on thinking of your future! 


If you don't have a 3 to 6 months emergency fund, use your refund to finance that. 

You could put some of it in a 3 or six-month saving CD if you want to try and get a little bit more interest. 

If you have an adequate emergency fund, strongly consider opening a Roth IRA with Vanguard or Fidelity or Schwab. 

Find out what their minimums are, and stick the money in a boring low cost total stock market index fund. 

You are young enough that even modest amounts thrown into a Roth IRA and let alone to grow and prosper over long periods of time, will let you take advantage of the compound interest curve. 

Your future self will thank you!

Good luck!",2021-02-14 00:15:24

MothMonsterMan300,"If this is about online idk, dont play it much. But I'll still throw in my two cents about the story's guns, having played it a bunch, and bc im bored and cant sleep and I'm a huge gun nerd. 

Revolvers: Schofield wins out but the LeMat gets a nod. The Schofield is the best balance between accuracy and power; the LeMat is way more powerful and has 9 shots but it takes way longer to re-aquire targets and has a learning curve to land hits. It would also only be about 10 years Hosea's junior at the time lol, crazy obsolete by 1899. But its *badass.* 

Pistols: the 1899 is weak but crazy accurate(like CRAZY once you dial it in, headshots at repeater range) the Mauser is powerful and available earlier, and the auto pistol is a balance between the two and shoots incredibly fast. Having used all 3 plus the Volcanic, the Mauser is the only one that holds up long-term bc the other 3 either rip through ammo or need constant maintenance. Mausers also win the cool factor for me. 

Repeaters: obviously the Lancaster is a cowboy classic and the Litchfield is the most powerful, but both reload slow as hell. The Evans is kind of weak but very accurate and holds 26 shots so you never need to reload. The carbine repeater stays surprisingly relevant late in the game bc it reloads *so fast* and handles faster than the other repeaters. Guess I would have to go Litchfield over all but it's only available really late in the game sadly. 

Shotguns: occasionally I'll still use the pump-action when I'm feelin froggy, but tbh I think shotguns are easily the most irrelevant and outclassed guns in the game. Nothing they can do cant be done better at every range by a repeater. They're brutal at point blank obviously but 99% of up-close fights are settled with your handguns or knife before it even occurs to you to pull up the weapon wheel. I even tried to lean on them in one playthrough just for the character and always wound up fighting with the handguns out of range frustration anyway. Special nod to the sawn-off for being able to cut hillbillies in half, though, thing's a riot.

Rifles: if you spend your first $150 on the Springfield and a scope, you will never want for money bc its perfect for hunting all large game. Great way to finance yourself early game. You get the rolling-block for free, but you cant opt to shoot with iron sights the way you can with the Springfield. Both are made TOTALLY obsolete by the bolt-action rifle which is, in my opinion, the best overall gun in the game. Both scoped and with iron sights it's useful as hell against people and animals. 

Special mentions: the bow is really effective and can shoot some crazy arrows but feels sadly underwhelming. With improved arrows its awesome for hunting large amounts of big game without scaring everything away, and you also need small game arrows to complete trapper items/satchel improvements.Throwing knives suck, tomahawks aren't much better but both have novelty. Molotovs are fuckin useless and dynamite is dangerous, but you can get a better feel for both by finding an empty field and feeling out the throwing distances. The lasso is for comedic relief, dragging klansmen through a swamp to be death-rolled by gators never gets old. And by god, you'd better learn how to throw your hands bc a fistfight can go very wrong very fast- which is why I usually just stab the guy. 

Just for fun: I call it ""Arthur Finally Lost It Mode;"" grow a huge beard and wear the tri-corner hat exclusively, assailing whoever deigns to cross Arthur's pirate path with the broken cutlass and twin sawn-offs. Bonus points for chugging Guarma Rum and trying to rob NPC's in canoes on Iron Lake like a Scooby-Doo villain. Alternatively the Viking helmet/axe, bow, and bearskin cloak make depopulating Butcher Creek feel a little more appropriate, but it's not like anyone is taking a census there anyhow.",2021-02-14 15:25:26

BowzaMan,"I just switched to ToS (early Jan, 2021), with past experience with E\*Trade, Ally Invest, M1 Finance, Wealthfront, Vanguard and Bank of America.

PROS:

* Highly advanced capabilities, if you want to learn them
* Platform will almost always be able to what you want to do, and more
* One-Cancels-Other functionality (If Order A takes place, then auto-cancel Order B, C, D)
* Scan functions are very powerful
* ToS was not one of the brokerages that took away consumers' right to buy equities of their choice during the GME rally

CONS:

* The platform is often overly complex for no reason; there is a very steep learning curve. I am still learning the ropes after \~6 weeks of frequent use
* The ToS community in this subreddit is often condescending, insulting, and generally unsupportive
* The platform sometimes has blatant blindspots in places where you wouldn't expect (e.g. there is no functionality to add up the total value of all pending orders. If you have a margin-enabled account, this means you can easily slip into margin / high-interest loans without your knowledge or intention).
* ToS likes to brag about the Education site, and how robust the training is. Personally, I've found this section to be lacking.

Overall, I would recommend ToS to anyone who is interested in upping their trading sophistication and placing advanced orders or scans. Inversely, if you're someone who likes ease of use, an intuitive UI, or a platform that makes your life easy, I'd advise you to look elsewhere.",2021-02-15 00:45:52

INTERGALACTIC_CAGR,"I feel like there are quite a few things at play here.   


1. The recession from COVID caused a massive cash out in the market
2. Cathie had amazing ARK returns on all ETFs 
3. Seeing the trend to online and work from home - old money finally caught on to innovation they have been stifling (ignoring and not investing)
4. With markets recovering money that was taken out of old sectors from the panic of the recession, is now going to emerging disruptive technologies and sectors like FinTech - SQ, PYPL, BTC, TSLA being the biggest news that marks a subtle transition to FinTech and BTC being taken seriously. Additionally SQ (\~1B) and Mass Mutual (\~100M) have bought BTC
5. People who are not as in tune with the shift are crying bubble and confused as hell because they are following momentum that they don't understand.
6. The people that are following innovation and actually believe in the companies they invest in like MicroPenis Inc, ain't scared of no bubble - momma didn't raise no paper handed bitch 

It feels like a paradigm shift in the market that many think is a bubble but I believe priorities have changed or at least the money has changed directions towards future innovation, Cathie's future is coming faster thanks to COVID and her outstanding ETFs.

Additionally Cathie had a Yahoo Finance interview where she believes the Bond market is in a bubble because of they way AMC and GME bonds reacted during the Sque-andal. Additionally, in the big ideas 2021 video the break down the S-Curve of the market with transition to new technology. Stocks be poppin' when disruptive technologies emerge and ARK says there are 5 coming, never before have that many emerged at once - ride this roaring fuckin' 20's!!!

buddyholly27,"Remember that the word ""finance"" ecompasses a bunch of different careers across different ""settings"" and is not really a meaningful label in and of itself. 

Traditional high finance career paths will have different earning curves to internal corporate function tracks to wealth management tracks to banking / lending tracks to insurance tracks to professional services financial advisory tracks to financial product sales tracks.

And even within each of these, there is variety: The comp structure / curve for IB is different from HF is different from PE within high finance. Working at a startup vs a financial institution vs a large corp vs a mid-market company will all carry different comp structures for corporate roles - then there is the case of whether you scale the exec ladder vs stay stuck at individual contributor / manager. Working in private banking vs a wirehouse vs discount broker will carry different comp curves / structured. Working in corporate banking (CIB) will carry a different comp curve to commercial / mid-market banking. So on and so forth.

It's extremely hard to generalise across ""finance"" without being specific. Kind of wish we introduced flares for these kinds of posts tbh so we know what ""type"" of roles people mean when referring to ""finance"". At the moment it's all a bit of a mess.",2021-02-16 01:00:30
Possible_Debate727,"From a finance major, it was a lot more math intensive with some more theory (and also quite a lot of writing) in fourth year. However, many of the courses were primarily through excel, the learning curve was not per say the actual math, but the depth and understanding of that math, and a larger scope and quantity of topics that were covered. Overall, still a quantitative heavy major.

Can't speak for accounting, but at an intermediate level, strong accounting skills are not really based on math skills, but of strong reading comprehension and being able to communicate that conceptual understanding well. There is also a certain applied logical thinking to Tax and Managerial Accounting that differs slightly to financial accounting, which many people do struggle with. 

It may seem very overwhelming, but you'll start to develop better study skills over time and you would be surprised at how much more you can handle and learn in 3rd and 4th year. 

I am not entirely sure how the process of transferring programs works, but from the experience of some friends, a lot of credits will transfer over. One friend was able to actually graduate in the same year as me even after they transferred over (I do believe they did take quite a bit of school in the summer). It is very doable, and compared to SAF, first year BM courses aren't as difficult/the program isn't as rigidly structured , so you should be able to take on more courses should you want to catch up and graduate in 4 years. If you move from BM to SAF, you will most definitely be at least a year behind because of how the program is structured, and the limited availability of courses each semester.

Again, I wouldn't recommend SAF straight out to say it's a better program. It really depends on where your interests are, and SAF is very focused on exactly it's name, Accounting and Finance. I do think that given your circumstances that you've already been accepted to SAF, I do think it is worth considering just because it'll be a lot harder to change from BM to SAF rather than the other way around.",2021-02-16 01:04:10
RepulsiveNumber,"The left there has been neoliberalized since the early 80s. From Mudge's *Leftism Reinvented*, on the Swedish case:

&gt; In the wake of another oil price shock the SAP won the 1982 election and returned to government in 1983. At this point there could be little doubt as to who won the war of the roses. The crisis program of the MoF rightists became part of the SAP’s 1982 election campaign, “presented as the Social Democrats’ alternative to social dismantling.”

&gt; The new SAP government’s “third way,” or “third path” policy (tredje vägens politik) launched with an unprecedented 16 percent devaluation, a tighter budget “to break inflation and to signal the end of devaluation,” and a host of “supply-side” reforms that included liberalizing finance and tax reform. On the heels of the devaluation Feldt made it clear that “compensatory nominal wage increases would not be corrected by expansionary fiscal measures or by new devaluations.” The introduction of market devices into public services was also important: the Ministry of Finance aggressively advocated “the introduction of various types of … ‘quasi-markets’ in the social services sector,” in which “the provision of services is separated from direct political control, and the role of government is reduced to that of ‘purchasing” services’ from competitive bidders.” Competition was also encouraged via Swedes’ exercise of choice in service provision.

&gt; Notably, the third way SAP government embraced a diluted version of the wage-earner funds and continued to situate full employment as its main objective. Party leadership was also aggressively anti-neoliberal in tone. Erlander’s successor, Olof Palme, declared unemployment a threat to human well-being and democratic stability, aggressively defending the trade union movement and the welfare state. Around 1985 Palme pursued “an enthusiastic campaign against ‘neoliberalism’ ”—a term that referenced the neoconservative, pro–free market right, particularly in Britain and the United States. As the SAP government rolled out third road policies, it still maintained full employment as a central objective. Yet the new government clearly rejected Keynesian means to Swedish social democracy’s ends. Rather, it appeared to move in lockstep with the formation of Swedish-style new classicism in economics.

&gt; By the mid-1980s Söderström sat at the head of both the SNS (CEO, 1985–2002) and the SNS Economic Policy Group (chair, 1984–1994). Thus situated, he made the case for rule-based economic policies—a Swedish version of the kind of anti-discretionary thinking expressed by Milton Friedman—mainstream. In the SNS’s official history, the rationale for the move was the experience of “stagflation”: since “the theory of rational expectations and supply side economics put the focus on the need to create long-term favorable conditions for economic growth through deregulation, comprehensive tax reform, and a monetary policy focused on price stability,” in the 1980s “the [SNS] Economic Council put forward the idea of a norm-based stabilization policy and price stability as the overriding norm for economic policy,” with a target inflation rate of between 2 and 4 percent. Sure enough, in 1985 the SAP government announced that it was ending political discretion in monetary policy and that it would not borrow to finance its debt but would rely instead on foreign holders of Swedish currency. In the account of the Swedish scholar Magnus Ryner, the financial and monetary arm of the SAP-in-government saw the end of monetary political discretion in favor of the discipline of international financial markets as the best means of managing inflation: “The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank reasoned that when unions, social service agencies and individuals took increased interest rate sensitivity into account, their propensity to consume would decline.”

&gt; On March 1, 1986, Palme was assassinated while walking home from the cinema, and was succeeded by Ingvar Carlsson (1934–). Neither SAP rhetoric nor economic policy changed considerably after Palme’s death, but Swedish economic management changed in a decidedly anti-Keynesian way. Inflation returned in the late 1980s, and in 1989 the SAP government abandoned exchange controls. Shortly thereafter Feldt announced, at a conference in Stockholm, that Sweden was opening its doors to foreign banks.

&gt; The effects of Sweden’s financial liberalization are shown in Figures 8.5 and 8.6. As the figures show, the effects of the SAP government’s new financial and monetary policies quickly set in: flows of foreign investment grew markedly in the 1990s and, under Göran Persson (1949–, Swedish PM 1996–2006) in particular, Sweden’s financial balance of payments went sharply positive.

&gt; Later, in 1999, Eklund—by this time a Chief Economist at the SEB—wrote in an “intellectual biography and manifesto” that Swedish “[p]arty politicians and interest organizations” had yet to fully grasp “just how radically Sweden is going to change due to globalization and the open economy.” In a mode that is reminiscent of the anti-discretionary, market-centered arguments of Milton Friedman in his 1960s exchanges with Walter Heller, Eklund called on Swedish political elites to attune themselves to the necessities of markets: the “forces of globalization,” Eklund argued, would have to be embraced if SAP politicians wanted to “advance prosperity.” By this time, Eklund’s words were undoubtedly true—but third road economic policy had played no small part in creating that new reality.

&gt; The question of whether or not the SAP of the mid-to late 1980s was, despite its rhetoric, “neoliberal” is not a very helpful one. Feldt was later adamant that the party’s aim was to avoid neoliberalism, not to embrace it. These self-accounts should be taken at face value. The question, then, is how it was possible for SAP leadership to understand third road policies, no matter how market-friendly, as anti-neoliberal. The analysis thus far suggests that this disconnect was a cross-field effect in which intraparty struggles drove changes in economics, and changes in economics shaped interpretive and programmatic struggles within the SAP.

&gt; Among the consequences, one stands out: the SAP could no longer hold the party-labor relationship together. Initially the SAP’s third road policies had the desired effect in terms of Sweden’s balance of payments, industrial competitiveness and profits, and a balanced budget. Unemployment declined to very low levels by 1989. But in the 1990s, even after the SAP returned to government in 1994, unemployment never returned to the sustained lows of the Keynesian era. Meanwhile, the Swedish economy remained Keynesian, in the Phillips curve sense: from 1970 to 2005 the correlation between inflation and unemployment rates in Sweden remained almost perfectly negative (−0.80). But, as shown in Figure 8.7, the historical prioritization of full employment was abandoned between 1991 and 1992 for the sake of keeping inflation low—ushering in a new era of inverted Keynesianism in Sweden.

&gt; With the return of unemployment came the end of wage solidarity and a considerable weakening of the party-union relationship. Containing wage demands was key to the party’s ability to manage the Swedish economy; to this end, the SAP government depended on the strength of corporatist institutions and the willingness of union leadership to agree to wage constraint. In the 1980s, union leadership was thus in the contradictory position of both representing workers and being a lever for the containment of wage demands, even as third road policies suggested that SAP leadership was no longer committed to facilitating compensatory trade-offs. By increasing private sector profitability at the expense of the public sector and making the labor market a zero-sum game from the perspective of workers, third way policies undermined the basic foundations of Swedish wage coordination. By extension, they destabilized the SAP-union relationship writ large. “The (correct) perception that profits were not channeled into productive investments, but into speculation and expansion abroad,” Ryner comments, “further undermined the legitimacy of government policy in trade unions circles.”

&gt; The effects of the breakdown in the SAP-union relationship, also a basis of the party’s ability to build cross-party coalitions, were manifest by the end of the 1980s. Carlsson offered his resignation after the Riksdag rejected an austerity package: the Swedish Communist Party would not agree to wage and price freezes. An attempted government-imposed freeze on wages, prices, and dividends plus prohibition on strikes produced across-the-board discontent, and the government was forced to step down. As the SAP led an initiative for EU membership, its public opinion ratings dropped below 30 percent—the SAP’s lowest level since the 1920s. The SAP lost the September 1991 elections and, despite a comeback in 1994, would never fully regain its electoral strength. In the end, Ryner argues, third road policies amounted to the self-sabotage of the SAP.

laura041211,"I worked at agencies with both b2c and B2B clients and now in house doing financial PR work. I have always preferred B2B work because I just find it more complex and interesting since you are communicating to a business audience with a complex understanding of the subject. 

One of the harder things about financial PR is that you might feel like a fraud sometimes since, unless you went to business school (I didn’t) you probably won’t have the sophisticated understanding of your company and the learning curve can be steep. But if you can get a basic understanding, you’ll be able to do your job just fine and will learn over time (and spend a lot of time on Investopedia!).

One thing to watch out for in finance, like the other person said, is an extremely risk averse culture. Finance, law, etc may not be as open to new ideas as some other companies, but there are always exceptions. Ask a lot of questions about how they interact with the media, approve ideas, market themselves, etc.

I would also ask if the role is more product promotion or more thought leadership. The latter will be way more interesting. If it’s the former, only a few select trades will cover your products and probably no one else will care.",2021-02-16 11:12:52

It shows in real time the curve of demand (dunno how it's called in englandino, but basically it shows the buys and sells in contrast with each other and their order books).  
You can also take a look at the Volume.  
Volume low is good, yes; it means there are few transactions. Remember that if it stays still, they still have to pay interests for their borrowed stocks while you're just here taking a shit in your toilet and playing some good vidyagames or eating crayons because you purchased a stocks and you don't have to pay something else to someone else.

Clear-Fudge,"First let's make a correction not a Mr, but your example proved the point I'm trying to make It is priced too high if only 10% of your fan base is purchasing. As far as your comment about setup to make a 5-minute video, You should be filming multiple videos per setup, You're filming it yourself there's no one else to pay but you're still charging at a professional rate. Scale the length versus cost of your video to that of professional porn videos, your videos are still grossly over the cost of professional production. And I am talking about business, in the laws of business are transferable across numerous platforms, and there are fundamental laws that are being broken. Take McDonald's, No one would call this gourmet food, yet it out sales more upscale restaurants exponentially, why, The dollar menu. They understand that you price something low people buy more. do you know on average people spend more on the dollar menu than they would have spent just buying a regular combo thus the company makes more profit. This is transferable to the only fans platform.

A creator with 100 subs that creates a video like you said for $20 and only 10 people purchase makes $200, that same video price at $5 if all 100 subs by it that same creator would have made $500, But that's in a perfect world, Even if only half the subs, 50, purchase this video you still make more money at $5 then you did at $20. Sales is a game of quantity. most of the females on the only finance platform do not have a brand You cannot charge Gucci prices for a product nobody knows. Further at $20 a sub buys a video, they're not going to turn around and purchase another $20 video the next day but they will at $5 to $10, so you're making more money. We can debate this all day but nothing will ever change these figures.

20 x 10 = 200

10 x 100 = 1000

  5 x 1000 = 5000

Scale that however you want you will always have this truth, the lower the price the more people will purchase.

I'll even go further and tell you eliminate PPV from your page completely none of my pages have it All my content is posted to the wall or sent free through DMs, with the exception of merch bundles, are my pages doing good, you be the judge my house will be paid off this year. One of my pages doesn't even have pictures or videos and I would gamble it still pulling down better numbers. 

And of course you would be against this because if everyone else loves their prices you would be forced to lower yours and you don't want to do that because you think you're going to be losing out. You spoke about the top 10% of creators and I promise you most of those do not have a high subscription cost and they are not charging $20 per video, I've shared the trials with hundreds of creators and seeing their pages in the way they move their content and though I don't agree with all of their practices they're still coming in below this $20 curve, because they understand that sales is a quantity game. 

The one thing we can agree on is how much time is spent on promotion and marketing, I don't know about 17 hours of screen time, but you will spend a lot of time doing promotional posting. This is not a constant because once you reach a certain level you spend less time having to continue promoting so much. It never ends I'm not saying that you always have to do promotion, but once you have a following big enough your brand takes on the life of its own subs will find you. I never one time imply that this is fast or easy money this is work like any other business. 

At the end of the day creators it's your page run it the way you want to and don't take my word for it do your own research, but I stand strong on my words that you will not make more because your prices are higher.",2021-02-18 02:51:27
kurupt311,"Yeah I think it’s TBD on whether it goes full on crypto apocalypse again; but, my concern is still large scale, established, reputable corporations adopting the technology since that is a huge driver of investment capital and use case proof.  Most large companies (except a few more “tech liberal” ones like Tesla as an example) are pushing back on crypto / block chain still and I see that having a few core reasons:
1. They are working through the standard change curve and are resisting something new 
2. The block chain tech (even when untethered to crypto as a fiat alternative) still gets lumped in together with prior BTC bull runs in people’s minds
3. Some people and groups in the past have heavily abused ICOs as a profit generation tool with no real business plans or ability to deliver resulting in less faith in alt / startup projects 

I don’t think these will individually cause another crash but collectively / all 3 and coupled with investors pulling massive gains from BTC and yeah I’ll be scared lol.  If this happens and we see anything like a few years ago, I would honestly be long-term INSANELY pumped for what I am seeing as “crypto’s mainstream adoption” which I still think is 3-5 years out.  By this I mean DeFi being common place; Fortune 500 adoption of block chain tech (and having block chain dev lines stood up) being a regular occurrence; etc.  Until more people in IT leadership roles at large companies get educated about these things and until there is enough of a sentiment shift towards acceptance and education, I still think we have a ways to go.  As it stands, I don’t see a lot of indication of what I would want to see to drive long-term and sustained success this iteration.  Again, hopefully I’m wrong lol.  If I am then this could be that final crypto bull run; but my gut tells me it needs one last push (some massive snowball of news in the space to generate so much forward momentum that it’s unstoppable - I.e. a major, heavily regulated financial institution adopting and implementing use of crypto and crypto use cases in multiple ways and choosing to somehow work both within centralized finance and DeFi simultaneously).  A company I am watching right now is MassMutual.  If they do more beyond their initial $100mm investment, that would be a tremendously strong sign to me ($100mm is nothing for them and it’s legit like them tossing a penny into a wishing well so even though it seems huge it’s a joke investment / a publicity stunt at best).  If MM or a company or a number of companies like that go balls deep then I think BTC will be sitting at insanely high levels (literally the store of electronic value for everyone, not just for us that use or invest currently) and projects like The Graph will become the next true gold rush and we will be on the ground floor of that.

NPRjunkieDC,"https://ragingbull.com/kb/how-to-make-money-with-penny-stocks/

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies. 

If you are using RH or WB that don't allow pennystocks there is a subreddit r/RobinHoodPennyStocks .
On NASDAQ many options like CTRM + SNDL + DGLY + HIMX + CIDM + NOK + ATOM+ ENG

upper_west_sider,"What do you mean where? It's just what's happening. Look at 10y and 30y yields (and 5 and 7 year). The 10y is up above 1.3% today, 40bps higher YTD. The 30y is 45bps higher. Obviously when the additional fiscal spending passes the treasury has to issue new debt to finance the spending, so that floods the market with treasuries and yields rise because nobody really wants them in the private sector with negative real yields across the curve. That's being priced in right now. The Fed can print money to purchase a ton of these and keep yields suppressed, which is what they've been doing and did in overdrive in March and April, however that just directly injects new printed money into the consumer economy which is hugely inflationary. They'll ultimately choose that route, though, because the alternative is letting stocks crash which would put GDP back on a negative trajectory and spiral the economy again. Many corporates go bankrupt, US starts having a hard time servicing interest at the high yields, etc. This reflation trade is close to consensus net long at this point among professional investors because everyone knows the Fed will not step in to tighten in the face of rising inflation due to these dynamics. Today is a prime example with stocks dumping due to yields rising, it's just starting to happen at an even lower yield level than I thought.",2021-02-18 23:46:25

defewit,"Alpha Homora offers leveraged yield farming. Meaning you deposit a certain amount of collateral, AH borrows funds on that collateral and uses it to earn yield on Sushiswap/Curve/etc, subtract the lending costs, and come out with a juicy yield.

The secret sauce that allows for up to 2.75x leverage is that different types of collateral types have different amounts of collateral credit and borrowing credit. These values are managed by smart people at Alpha Finance to maximize capital efficiency while minimizing risk. This allows for otherwise under-collateralized loans and is made possible because AH borrows from Cream's Iron Bank without supplying collateral. Iron Bank is not open to anyone and can only be interacted with whitelisted contracts which are partners such as Alpha Finance.

DevsMustDie,"Sorry, I'm seeing your reply only today!  


As to why the game didn't do well, I think there are several things that come into play.

  
First I don't think our publisher did enough to promote the game especially outside of Europe. When we signed with them and talked about events, I knew we would go to Gamescom, but we only went in the business area and their PR partner didn't manage to book that many meetings with journalists. I was expecting them to get a booth at a PAX or another event in the US, but they never did which I found disappointing.  They also started to talk about the game way too close to the release date I think and couldn't get any help from Nintendo even if we had a simultaneous release on Steam and Switch and had developed specific features for the console version.


All in all, I don't think the PR agency they hired for the job was very good. When we got copies of the press release they send, they were like all text, at first there wasn't even a link to the presskit!! We got them quite late every time, so it was difficult to ask for changes when we saw them first.

The release date was horrible, right between RDR2 and Death Stranding (which probably explain part of the lack of press attention) but they wouldn't change it because they needed the game to release in 2019 (I guess because of their financing calendar, higher ups wouldn't accept that money spent in 2019 would start paying back in 2020 or smth like that).

We didn't get any success with the bottlespark campaign they ran and so several thousands euros where spend to reach influencers and streamers and we saw very few returns. Like less than 10 live streams and the most successful one only had about 100 average viewers for 2 hours. Definitely a bad investment, I think that also linked to the lack of previous hype.

But we also made mistakes on our side for sure! The game is too difficult, especially since it plays differently than your classic 2D platformer, so the learning curve is too steep for most people. I think this didn't help with streamers and general word of mouth if people dropped the game early because they felt they were bad at it while they didn't want to invest the time to actually get better - which I can understand. 

This makes me think that we might have missed the spot when communicating about the game, but I still think that using the ""do you have what it takes to beat that game?"" marketing strategy is way harder for indies than for an AAA prod like Dark Souls.

We also playtested the full game too late in development and with players that were ""too close to our target audience"", meaning that they enjoyed the difficulty and having to learn how to play. If we had anticipated that earlier, we might have had some time to adjust that or implement a few level design tricks to make players feel better about their performance in the game.


What I'm most disappointed about is that we launched a demo about a month before launch and had a ""crowd scoring contest"" with it. We added the scores of every entry on the 1st level leaderboard, and when that total exceeded a certain amount, we gave a better launch discount to everyone. We had goals to increase the discount from 10 to 20% I think, then added the soundtrack for free as a bonus and had one last bonus that wasn't reached. To our knowledge, this was the first time anything like that had been tried (though other games did ARG or contests, I don't think they linked any of that to an actual launch discount) but we didn't get any press cover and we got about 1000 participants, for an actual 100 sales on the release day...

So in the end, we're still proud of our game, especially considering that we brought what was a graduation project to an actual game on PC and console, founding a studio in the process, we learned a lot and I have to say that even after playing the game many hours during development, I still enjoyed playing it and getting all achievements on Steam when I had the courage to play it again 2 months after the release haha! But on the business side of things, it's a bust. We're never going to recoup and the cash we had left after the release is not enough to finance a new prototype, so every one got a new job of their own. Now we have a company that has a few thousand euros sitting by (thanks to the grant we got that gave part of the money after the release...) but even if we gave it back to the friends and family that invested money in our company, they would get about a 10th of what they gave us. And that's the bitter feeling that I can't shake.",2021-02-19 04:37:05

Another fact is that ISO20022 is being launched in Nov 2021 on a global network and will be the new SWIFT standard. ISO20022 needs oracles in order to function across thousands of different centralized ledgers; banks, financial markets, telecom etc. We also know that software company Oracle is involved, a long term partner of LINK - however they do not offer oracles, how funny that may sound according to their business name. So, who in this whole world would be better or more likely to provide the oracle / smart contract infrastructure for ISO20022 over Chainlink? Please tell me...
Furthermore, we are investors, we need to be ahead of the curve, therefore we need to speculate and extrapolate future scenarios in order to make the right investment decisions.

So speculation? Maybe. Likehood of this being tue? A lot, imo. Just look at the LINK blog and what they write specifically about ISO20022 and the financial markets as a whole.

Although we have convinced our younger son to also do Comp Sci at A-level so that he has something to support a backup plan.  I was going to study law until I found a passion for creative pursuits, I went to a “public school”(private school for non brits) here in the UK so had many educational opportunities at my fingertips. Instead I have a BA in animation and interactive art. I have been in games/entertainment media in one way or another since 1997, programming in everything from Metropolis to Lingo to C# along the way. I do firmly have a foot in both sides (the “creative design” side as well as the “development” side) so I am by no means an expert coder.

I also passed this thread on to someone at intogames. It is a charitable organisation focused on mentorship and similar activities to help foster young people getting into the games industry (especially from under-represented backgrounds).

There is of course plenty of competition and comp sci in the finance industry probably has a much higher pay ceiling, but at the end of the day money is used for enjoyment as well as survival, so there is a balance to find between how much enjoyment you get out of earning that money in the first place. We have compSci/higher math grads that could be in the finance industry, but are much happier in this industry, even with lower pay.

You can also look into non gaming industries that seek out game industry folk. I have been approached by startups &amp; established businesses on other markets(medical,education,travel) that want to introduce game psychology/gaming elements into their user experiences.

You should also consider getting ahead of the curve (mastering Unity ECS &amp; DOT) this will really put you in a strong position down the line and make it much easier to secure employment.

urethrapaprecut,"I know I say this every time but it's never not true. Feel the grief, experience the pain, start working towards a solution. The only thing we do by relenting to utter despair is ensure it will not change. Things will happen slowly and you will almost certainly never see the fruits of your labor but it's like global warming, it's about something bigger than us.

This current configuration of society has done us some good, Corporations and ingenuity have created this lavish and comfortable life that many of us get to experience (compared to fending for ones self in the forest). However, it is very important to note that lavish and comfortable experiences are not necessarily meaningful ones. This is a selfish society but only because the people at the top are selfish. I think, I know we can do better. But every good piece of progress that society has reaped has been fought for, tooth and nail. Just because our grocery stores are usually full and our heat works most of the time doesn't make people happy, and it doesn't mean the work is done. We can see there are many facets of society where great effort is being expended to improve, sexual liberty, racial liberty, but work and income is losing ground. We have to fight for it, or it will only get worse.

What we can do: Vote for people who are willing to change the system. I know it feels like voting doesn't do anything, and it's true that it doesn't do _much_ but that's only because complacency has filled our political systems with grifters and the money-hungry and those people have set up a system to help themselves maintain power. The people we elect today have the power to change the rules forever. I believe that though we don't see much currently, if we really continue to expend true effort and heart, we're at the start of an exponential curve. Once the rules start to change it becomes much harder for the assholes to maintain their power and easier for good to win, it compounds.

What rules? 
1. In america the two party system is a natural consequence of our first-past-the-post voting system. We can transition to ranked choice to allow more diverse opinions and break 2 party stalemates. 
2. Proportional representation to truly represent the views of the constituents and not just which party has slightly more people than the others. Campaign finance reform, self explanatory. 
3. Better economic prospects and national safety nets that will afford people to stop worrying about food and health and start to participate in and change a political system that has fucked them for generations.
4. Getting the word out. There are things we can do and I believe spreading despair only makes it harder for people to do the necessary work to fix this.
5. Many, many more things I cannot remember right now. The ideas exist, we just need to get them to the right people and get those people to the right place.

In terms of getting a finance job they literally tell you how to do it, case competition and being in a finance group as well as join the student venture/investment fund

They say often in your third coop is when you get a finance job as it's practically near 0 chance for a first coop as you don't get enough education and experience yet

ryebit,"Ethereum (and most blockchains) all use very standard cryptographic primitives. SHA2 / SHA3 for hashing, ECC (elliptic curve cryptography) for asymetric encryption.

Know what else uses those primitives? *EVERYTHING*. SSH tunnels, VPN traffic, HTTP over TLS/SSL, version control software, x509 certificates, pretty much all government communications, you name it.

If a quantum computer rolls out that can crack those primitives, Ethereum failing will be one tiny ember on the burning log that is the finance industry, all within a huge raging forest fire that is pretty much all of the public internet.

And anyone who can crack those protocols isn't going to start somewhere that will leave a visible public trail, like a blockchain -- they'll start stealing passwords from the CIO of Mastercard, untraceably rewrite ownership records for some Amazon shares. Or, since it'll probably be a nation-state, they'll go after military secrets first.

Even if SHA3 or ECC is cracked, and crypto is 10x it's current size, I think there will still be much more viable targets. Because the last thing you'll want to do is something that makes people aware you can break those algorithms.",2021-02-21 23:09:07

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Madoff

This cost investors around $65 billion dollars, by the time it foundered, it mostly came to light because of the great financial crisis, of 2007-8. At the time of it's uncovering Madoff was a somewhat legendary figure on Wall Street, he'd been scamming people for 30 years.

Usually there is a line, the one where ""number goes up"" one such line is $USDT it goes straight up, following an exponential curve. In finance that is usually unnatural.

2 trillion dollars is a lot of money, a material risk to any bank that holds it, since tether has a 1:1 with the US Dollar. It will make a sizable hole.

PlayingTheWrongGame,"&gt; With a 50/50 senate and a narrow lead in the house, how CAN he pursue “substantial change?”

* Allow the Federal Employee Pay Comparability Act to fully go into effect. It's been blocked by every President since Bush I, but all he has to do is *not* block it from going into effect to solve a lot of the issues the federal government has hiring and retaining good people.

* Shift work out of the hands of contractors back into the federal government. This would reduce costs (freeing up funds for other efforts: see point 3), improve job performance and outcomes, and also strip funding away from the money laundering scheme that helps finance our dysfunctional politics.

* Wield the tools that Republicans setup for Trump to take more executive power. Ex. declaring climate change a national emergency and using it to reprogram DOD and DOT money to address climate change mitigation, and to order the EPA and such to enforce existing laws more heavily.

* Order the new AG to split his time between cracking down on violent extremism *and following the money* that flows between violent extremist groups, the non-profit political groups that launder the money, and the politicians who are also on the payroll. This would probably catch quite a few conservative Senators in the net, creating opportunities to replace them.

* Order the DOJ to *also* step up enforcement of voting rights protections that are already on the books. Pick some agency within the federal government to quantify the impact of gerrymandering and to objectively determine whether it has discriminatory impact against racial minorities in violation of the voting rights act.

* Aggressively going after the foreign inflows of money and misinformation coming from bad actors of the world stage. There are many, not just Russia.

* Whenever conservatives start making a big public stink about media bias, start publicly endorsing a return of the fairness doctrine to deal with media bias. Get Democrats in Congress to put forward some legislation to reestablish it.

* Use the bully pulpit to push for the changes the progressive wing wants. Be ahead of the curve on messaging, not just waiting until the mass of Democrats have been pulled along already.

* Use the FTC to go after businesses that are plainly abusing their customers with ruinous fees. Ex. the payday loan industry.

* Start blocking mega-mergers and other accumulations of capital in the hands of a few. Force the breakup of big tech companies via anti-trust laws.

othello16,"BOA is an option, it really depends on your goals. Ask your delf these 4 questions and you'll be able to settle on a few options that are best for you.

1. How much money do you have
2. How much money are your trying to make
3. How much are you willing to lose
4. How long are you willing to wait?

Each question feeds into the other. I.e. 

1. I have $1000.00
2. I want to make $100 (some I'm looking for something that moves about 10% - 15%
3. I'm willing to lose half (nut moves less than 50% - 60%
4. Within a week (so the day to day variation on a daily chart is greater then ~ 2.5% but less than 10%  ) 

Now you start:
1.  Look at some charts &amp; perform a little technical analysis
2. Check the Git repository, or news, social media sites etc. to determine if there is a bullish or bearish sentiment.
3. Now that you performed some due diligence, place your order and set a  stop lose. 

As for passive,

All of the above steps, except there is no stop loss. Check out Sushi swap, curve, BAO finance, Uniswap and find consider providing to a liquidity pool that comes closest to addressing those first 4 questions you asked yourself. It help give a reality check so your not aiming to high or low. You'll also know when to pull out ( which is always the hardest part) 

I hope that helps.",2021-02-22 04:25:06

* **Compulsory use of flairs** that denote a post as regarding Branding Copy or Direct Response copy. Too many posts where the copy in point is clearly trying to achieve one goal while the comments are full of people arguing over the fact it doesn't achieve a different goal.

npno,"&gt;So i did the math and i asked them so you guys are just going to give me what i owe you guys basically what about the 12k i paid into the car? He responded, but he didnt really answer my question but i get it. Cars are a depreciating asset. 

This is true, cars are a depreciating asset. In practice, lending institutions willstructure a car loan so that follows the projected depreciation curve as close as possible, so it not out of the ordinary to owe pretty close to the market value of your car if you were to sell it today.

&gt;I told him i looked on his website and the cars are going for 16k. I understand you guys gotta make profit but id like a bit more for the car.

You're going to be hard pressed to get more than what he offered you if he's selling similar cars for only ~$2k more. The spread on used cars is typically a bit more than that, but used car value has shot up a bit because of COVID so I guess that's a normal spread now.

&gt;The most he did for me was he offered me 2020 demo car with 9000km on it with a free 5 year warranty. Id lease it for $110 bi weekly for 5 years or finance it for 128$ bi weekly. I told him i really wasn’t interested in a demo because i know how people drive demo cars. He told me he doesnt give these deals out to people often and i would be paying .49 interest.

All this info is basically irrelevant without stating the actual cost of the car, not the monthly payment.

&gt;Then i called my insurance and they told me instead of paying 165 a month id be paying 324 a month. Which is crazy to me because the new car has more safety features.

They also cost a lot more to repair, hence the higher cost to insure.",2021-02-23 02:57:31

dudelydudeson,"Ok, I think I see what you're getting at. Forgive me, newish. Basically, you're planning to get paid to own a free put at a fairly OTM strike for just earnings week. Let's do some napkin math and calculate that IV in the earnings week (5th week) would have to be 4\*(long-short)+short = 240%. You're saying that up to 240% IV is already priced in for that week. If GME shits and IV spikes above that, you're in gravy town and you got paid to make all those gains. Just as long as it doesn't fall off a cliff before earnings week.

However, I personally don't feel confident enough in this kind of vol arbitrage. Isn't the point that everyone knows BS is a bad model and the market makers apply all kinds of correction algos to the market prices, which is why IV% doesn't follow BS anymore? Not sure, I'm a novice in mathematical finance. 

I think you're flipping a coin with ""I think it's going to tank after earnings but not before"" more than you think you are, but, what the hell do I know. My best guess is you collect the premium and the long put goes out worthless. Still theta, still money. Just low return on risk.

Also, trade seems positioned right. It's basically everything neutral except theta - perfect. Shit is gonna go bananas if it tanks anyways, we can throw the models out the window.

The setup worked with GME but maybe there's other tickers out there?

Sounds like you're conservative on your risk management - me too. It's hard to let a trade go late day like that since it's likely not going to be there the next morning, smart to downsize. Often times I open half the position then see how the market gets on, try to see if I can reopen the other half at the same or better pricing. If I see the trade price hitting resistance I'll open the other half. Kind of trading the intra-day momentum to get the best price. I would guess this is an activity that is well on the wrong side of the effort/return curve but whatever, still learning and not a lot of positions to manage.

Babajide94,"Disclaimer: I’m your total average joe who don’t know more about economics and the securities market than what I read online.

I’d say it depends on how heavily invested you are and what your investment horizon is. If your long on a company you truly believe that poses great results (Ex: Tesla) I’d sit back and relax for now and not worry myself. 

I have a few long positions, but I’m mostly in short positions and attempt to follow the market as there’s so much money to be made. This isn’t a good time to fall in love with a single stock. Especially not fairly new start ups in the Cannabis, biopharma, blockchain tech and etc. Take good gains and move on.

With the recent trading days (last week and today), my new game plan this week is to 
review my portfolio positions, double down on high conviction positions and sell low conviction ones. Establish a new position in short 3x leveraged inverse etf (nasdaq &amp; s&amp;p 500) in case these red days keep going. Function as a “cushion” to hedge any upcoming &amp; ongoing bear runs. These inverse etfs are at all time lows, personally feel like you can’t lose getting into it. If you 3x, your portfolio have a good chance of surviving a market “correction”. Also, it seems like a good time to invest in commodities, silver and gold. At some point the curve will shift from the “yet to happen” market to the commodity market. Especially when thing start going south. SIL, SILJ, GDX and GDXJ strong for the future. 

If you read further it’s just me rambling my thoughts. 

There seems to be a new “life changing stock” on reddit everyday, and also a industry changing “SPAC merger” on the news every single week. I don’t live under a rock, and I’m aware the industry is changing in several areas, which Cathy Woods explains excellently. Just an example of what I’m wary of; with all the new EV companies competing against each other right now, only a few will be successful household names in the end. 

Some of us have been very fortunate and made 30..50...80.. even +100% gains on our portfolios. I’ll be honest. I just started trading back in March and I was up 157% come Wednesday last week, before these red days. I’m still over 100%, but I’m no fool. I’m no expert on economics, finance nor the securities market, I know my gains have been boosted by low interest rates, massive injections in form of government aid relief packages, and weekly positive news that sends us retail investors flocking to a new stock. 

With money flowing that freely, if I was a company I’d want a piece of that as well, market the crap out of ourselves and flood the internet with news of new events. In the end it’s our product that decides how successful we are, not our marketing efforts alone. 

I hope everyone has made money during this insane bull run. Might not see another one in our lifetime, so take your gains when it makes sense and be careful!",2021-02-23 13:56:39

magneticmicrowave,"Yes and no, there's so many types of corporate credit it's tough to say how any of it is handled. For SMEs (Small Medium Enterprise) most transactions will be handled out of a revolver which is a fancy bank account  for businesses that lets you run a negative balance up to some predetermined limit, but it can easily be millions or even billions for very large enterprise customers. You pay a small percentage of the available funds so you might pay 25-50k a year to have a 10 million revolver. When you go negative the interest rate on the negative dollars increases to your market rate. 

For long term debt the loans are secured against the value of the company, they act a bit more like a mortgage because you'll get a loan on 5-year terms but the payment plan rarely will have you paying back the full amount during the first term. The bank can usually choose to call the full amount at any time and there are all sorts of agreements and metrics between the bank and the business that are tracked monthly or quarterly. Depending on the size of the company you might have a finance department that spends 4-8 weeks a year preparing stuff so the bank knows you'll still be able to pay a year from now. 

If I have an EBITDA (a relatively useless metric for comparing the size of business' across industries invented by investment bankers in the 80's to essentially justify ever higher valuations) of 4 million and want a 12 million dollar loan you have a ratio of 3.0:1. 

1. You need to convince the bank you're a good investment, with a plan for how that 12 million is going to help turn you into a 6million EBITSA company at the end of 6 years. 
2. Bank says sure, but you owe us 6% interest 3.0+, 4.5% 2.0-2.99, 3.5% for 1.0-1.99, and 2.5% for below 1.0.
3. Bank says because you are using this money to grow the business we're going to adjust the amortization schedule and you need to pay back 6 million in 6 years and  you'll still owe us 6 million at the end of the term. 
4. To help you out more, because you're using this to invest in the business we will adjust it further so you'll owe interest +250k in principal repayment the first year, interest +750k in principal the second, 1 million in principle in year 3&amp;4 and 1.5 million in 5&amp;6. (Actually just a good way of making sure companies aren't in a huge rush to pay the debt down fully and maximizes the interest, the bank only makes money when it has loans out)  

In the end the plan is to have an EBITDA of 6million and debt of 6 million after 6 years. 

666 baby! Ratio of 1.0, very healthy. If it works out the bank says ""Hey!, any plans for how you'll make it to 9 million in the next 6 years? We can give you another 12 million for those plans and role the whole thing into a new loan package based on the new value of the company."" 

That's generally when smaller companies get into trouble because the growth curve always slows down. If you've enjoyed 50% growth over 6 years it will likely be harder to maintain that rate. Throw a recession in there during the second term and our once healthy company is in serious financial trouble. The bank always just assumes you'll grow, if you don't they make it your problem. Until you get big enough then it does become the banks problem. 

These finance guys all operate in such a vacuum it would be hilarious if it wasn't so damaging to the economy. Some of the valuations I've had come across my desk over the years are ludicrous from VCs and PE companies. EBITDA is so easy to manipulate that if you're planning to sell a company you can depress it for a year or two and then 'grow it' for 2-3 years and then sell to someone else for a massive profit because it's growing so quickly. 

Private Equity is basically what you're planning on doing with Credit Cards but with companies. 

1. I get a few rich people to give me money
2. I find a few companies for sale I think I can work with, usually in the same industry
3. I use my investor's money to buy 10-40% of the business with our 'investment' and then I get a bank to cover the rest. 
4. I then transfer that debt onto the company balance sheet, start merging my unrelated companies. 
5. Conduct reorganization, generally change accounting methods to start making things look a little better. 
6. 3-4 through accounting and hopefully actual efficiency gains I am now growing quickly
7. Year 5-6 sell. I've rarely paid off more than a fraction of the bank debt at this point, best part is whoever buys it from me is just going to do the same thing. 

Every time the company 'moves up' and changes hands the debt load just increases. Eventually reality catches up and there is no 'big jump' with someone who buys it, efficiencies have been found, accounting tricks have been played and growth of debt has outpaced the company. The debt the company holds is more than it can afford to pay, because they paid what the company WOULD be worth in investment banker fantasy land. 

But big PE companies are doing this with 10-100 companies at a time. If one of them fails who cares? Some of your other bets will more than cover your losses. Don't forget I'm actually only putting 10-40% of the 'price' of the company down from my investors. That's all I need to 'cover' out of the profits from my other investments. They put in so little of their own capital that massive returns are possible so a few failing doesn't bother anyone at home office.

So you try to grow your way out of it, because that's what PE does, maybe it works, likely you overstretch yourself and the company gets liquidated. PE group doesn't care there's no real cost to them other than a little less profit from somewhere else. The PE company itself has likely been charging outrageous management fees for a while anyways.

In case you're wondering I sometimes work with PE and it is a toxic cancerous industry that doesn't care who is left holding the bag as long as it isn't them. If you don't have skin in the game you shouldn't be allowed to play. I've seen good healthy companies that started with private owners go through the PE thing and it gets nasty. A lot of the time the previous owners were sold a bill of goods, often taking minority ownership stakes that leave them completely powerless, or agreements that dilute their stake down to nothing because the financial targets the PE company told them were going to happen didn't materialize.

dmoccia,"Thank you for posting this comment, it really resonates with me.  I have been using the last couple of months to educate myself more on the crypto ecosystem and determine how different coins fit together/complement each other and what projects can actually deliver value.  I come at this from a data science/developer perspective (drug discovery not finance) so it has been a steep learning curve understanding the lingo and concepts.  

u/Weaver96 gives great examples of why there is room for competition and innovation.  I do not see any reason why there would not be multiple ecosystems consisting of a central blockchain with smart contracts (like ETH), ways to extend those contracts (LINK) and query them (GRT).  There are many uses for this sort of infrastructure (and others) and I do not think specific industries will simply adopt the gold standard.  Instead they will look to experts in their field which have integrated the technology and speak their language whether it is finance, insurance, medicine, transportation, shipping, etc.  Undoubtably there will be projects that fail as there are companies that fail.  In fact I am confident saying that some well thought out projects will fail simply because the team does not know how to get to the right market or does not know the right people.  

If you like ""your coin"" more than others I would encourage you to listen to what others are saying about ""their coin"" as you may learn something.  There are simply too many projects to research and understand so I think it is important to have an open mind.",2021-02-25 22:50:36

lwc-wtang12,"Who the hell said they were stupid? I definitely did not. The concept of ethereum is brilliant. But there is no way they could have predicted the future of how proof of work would turn out. Now they are a bit behind the curve of research and progression and it isn't even their fault. It's just a reality.

Loopring and raiden are compelling. I've been following both. I just don't think they solve the real issue of scalability to the point of a global system. I think to do that we need to start with a FAR more powerful base layer and infrastructure. I don't think that layer is eth. At least at the moment, and that's a personal opinion. 

Also, i'm not attacking anyone here. I will admit my discovery of the recovery key situation made me mad and I acted on anger towards the brave team, but at this point, you're just attacking me for having an opinion. To me, layer 2 on eth is a band-aid (albeit a pretty powerful patch job) for a broader problem. It will do wonders for the short term and maybe carry eth just far enough so people don't jump ship before eth 2.0. 

As I already stated, I think the broader goal should be decentralized systems for as many verticals as we (humanity) can apply them to within reason (i.e. finance, law, voting, identity, and so on). I think we should strive to get there as quickly as possible with the best tech possible. Right now ethereum is simply not the best tech and catching up could take a good deal of time.",2021-02-26 05:42:18
MentalValueFund,"&gt; Can you explain a bit more about why this is the case? I'm having trouble connecting the dots and walking through the logic. 

So lets look at this conversation as a overly simplistic formula for . PV is present value (today's dollars). FV is future value (whatever the future cash flow is). d is your discount rate. And n is the amount of years in the future that cash flow happens at.

    PV = FV / (1 + d)^n 

So the reason treasury rates are important is because how you derive ""d"". I don't want to get into too big of a tangent because there's a lot more to it than this but, in a nutshell ""d"" is the weighted average between a company's ""cost of debt"" and ""cost of equity"". Ignoring debt (though it's affected too), the cost of equity formula is basically =

    Risk free rate + (risk premium)*levered beta

Risk premium is just a spread that investors expect the general equities market to perform over the risk free rate and levered beta can be thought of as correlation between the stock you're valuing and the broad market.

This formula is called the CAPM formula (capital asset pricing model) and basically the gold standard in finance for cost of equity. [Here's a good link that talks about rfr's relationship with cost of equity.](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/risk-free-rate/)

So now to recap, as treasuries rise (the risk free interest rate) so does the discount rate which investors are valuing future cash flows (""d"" in the first formula). As you increase the denominator in the very first formula, the PV number is going to shrink.

&gt; Also, what is the relationship between the treasury rate and the fed prime interest rate? I know the fed can change the prime rate whenever they want (and right now it's close to 0%). Are the fed also change the 10-year treasury rates whenever they want, or is the 10-year treasury rate dictated by market mechanics? 

Great question. So the Fed doesn't actually set the ""prime rate"", you might be confusing that with something else.  The only interest rate they actually have authority to set is called the Overnight Bank Funding Rate or more simply, ""overnight rate"". In a nutshell, primary banks in the country are required to keep a certain amount of reserves in their account with the Fed. If you have excess reserves, they can be lent out on an unsecured basis to other primary financial institutions for an overnight period. Banks use this for too many things to start getting into but the important thing here is to think of this as the most risk free possible rate any entity could have for borrowing a dollar over night.

The reason this is the only direct interest rate the fed sets is because it is the end of the rope that has a domino effect on everything after it. The term ""yield curve"" refers to a basic graph where you form a curve between all the individual ""risk free"" interest rates starting with the overnight rate and going all the way out to the 30 year treasury rate.

There's a whole conversation here on what curve bootstrapping is but that's not worth getting into. The basic answer to your question about 10 year yields is that is the treasury yield determined by the secondary market traders who buy and sell treasury notes/bills/bonds. More people buying means the yield decreases. More people selling means the yield increases.

The reason behind why they buy and sell is a multitude but at the very least is influenced by their expectations on inflation and as a result of increased expected inflation, they expect the Fed to raise the overnight rate. Or if they expect deflation/lower inflation than previously expected, they may buy treasuries and expect the overnight rate to not rise as much (or possibly decrease).",2021-02-26 08:35:39

Bob-Rossi,"Trent Van Epps has put together a GitHub catalog of applications &amp; projects that have shown their support of EIP-1559 – [HERE!](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/1559-outreach)

**Please consider (respectfully!) messaging / tweeting / tagging your favorite dapps &amp; builders to try and get them to show support by issuing a repo within the GitHub page to be added.**

While EIP-1559 generally has support across the Ethereum community, a large group of mining pools have recently voiced their disapproval of EIP-1559. This includes the two largest pools at the moment – [Spark Pool](https://twitter.com/sparkpool_eth/status/1357633927914024960?s=20) &amp; [Ethermine](https://twitter.com/etherchain_org/status/1351610475281309697) whom will end up [mining about 44.5% of blocks on any given day.](https://etherscan.io/stat/miner?blocktype=blocks)

One of the most powerful tools against miner action is to show that a forked chain will not be supported by the fee generating users of the network. It really is as a simple as that – the more dapps that show support for EIP-1559, the more likely it will pass without (significant) miner contention. Miners follow will the profit and because of this the community has pull then you would think when it comes to if an EIP will get implemented.

* **Apps:** 1inch / Aave / Airswap / BadgerDAO / Balancer / bZx / Curve / Dark Forest / Dharma / Gitcoin / MakerDAO / mStable / Opium / Opyn / Sushiswap / Synthetix / Yam Finance

Faithless_Edward,"&gt;I'm pretty sure you're well-read enough to know the research that shows that immigrants disproportionately contribute to economic growth.

It is true, however one must realize that immigrants are humans and humans are limited beings, both in their productivity of the capital produced, and their variables. If we spend the same amount of money (around $50 Billion every year) on automating the industries that we do on Illegal Immigration, we would become the largest manufacturer of the world, creating huge budget surplus, because unlike humans, machines are not constrained to society or limited in their productivity to produce capital. They don't need wages, they work as long as you power them.
https://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/the-fiscal-cost-unlawful-immigrants-and-amnesty-the-us-taxpayer (The sources lean conservative ideologically)

&gt;Immigrants don't just generate labor, they also generate demand, and they are better entrepreneurs than seventh- generation Americans. 

Sure, but the United States already has enough demand to fuel its economy for the next century to come. Immigrants in average have a less purchasing power than their native counterparts. Entrepreneurship doesn't mean anything, capital generation does. Startups have a failure rate of nearly 90% https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp

&gt;If you change the wage curve for a lot of immigrant- dominated jobs, you're also going to change expenses, which will hit prices, which will hit demand. This stuff doesn't happen in a vacuum. Think about the debate over raising the minimum wage-- the focus is always on how raising wages kills jobs.

No its not the same. Raising minimum wage raises the purchasing power (if the currency is stable and not in hyperinflation or deflation) while raising the number of immigrants raises the labor supply. Higher labor supply than what the market requires causes unemployment, which is a section of population with very low purchasing power. This doesn't translate into an increase in demand, since a section with low purchasing power will always have a lower consumption rate. If your theory held true, then an Increase in the United States population should have saw an increase in wages and capital generation, but the only thing growing is our economy. Last year we jit the highest deficit to GDP ratio in our country's history.

&gt;The experience in chicken processing, for example, is that Americans just don't want those jobs at anything approaching a manageable salary. 

Yes, because they pay you $5/hr because they have people who are willing to do it for $5/hr.

&gt;United States been a time when picking most produce was a job done mostly by American citizens.

Yes, mostly. Because Immigrants always made some part of the country for its entire history. Obviously when you have a section of a population that is immigrant, you will have them in every statistic.",2021-02-27 03:46:57
