PeaceLazer,"I literally work in finance lol

&gt;  I’d rather lease than invest in depreciating liabilities.

You're not avoiding exposure to depreciation by leasing. Your monthly payment is paying for depreciation + interest. The main benefit of leasing is in the time value of money. If you get a low enough rate that your money could get more in some other investment, not that you're avoiding depreciation.

&gt; Why would you invest money in cars

Cars are bad investments in general, but that is irrelevant if you need one anyways. I would much rather get a 10k car near the bottom of its depreciation curve and sell it 5 years later for 8k, than get a brand new 25k car and sell it 5 years later for 12k",2021-04-01 04:24:00
Syentist,"Bruh did you just  come to an ethereum community and shill a centralised fintech startup? 

Jokes aside, you must be nuts to hand over your funds to an opaque fund, especially with the recent uncertainties with negative NAV for GBTC (which was a major method by which BlockFi financed their interest rates)

Take the time and read up on defi blue chips and how you can actually use them (not just speculate on their tokens). Curve stable coin farms (10%+ easily). Lend stablecoins to aave or compound, borrow ETH (you'll make around 8% right there), stake half on Lido, then LP ETH-stETH on curve (probably another 10%). And so many many more. Using these apps gives you an understanding of the space, and they true value proposition of ETH. And best of all, you're not handing over your funds to a third party.

crypto100kk,"You don't need a ton of money in crypto. Crypto is a broke man's game. You obviously don't understand the point of crypto. It is to bank the unbanked and allow random people without any high level of finance to be able to easily profit big. You won't see x100 gains in stocks or traditional finance and if you do, its usually really complicated to even understand. With crypto, its very easy to turn even 2k usd into 200k because of how easy the learning curve is. Its very open and accessible to everyone unlike traditional finance.

If you truly had a few years under your belt, you would understand this.

The fact you are in your 6 figures may be the reason you are too blind to see how crypto is for the average person and not for only people of your level of income of 6 figures. I know this because I've turned a few thousand into 6 figures with crypto. Its amazing what crypto can do for the broke man.",2021-04-01 06:04:58

Not-you_but-Me,"Those people who are in data sciences are generally the same people working in the “make money careers”. Finance at least is all about data science... that’s why the hours are long and the pay is high. 

You’re right about it being easy to make money with money, that wasn’t my point. I was nitpicking OPs suggestion that CFOs, and MBAs are in easy careers. 

I disagree with IQ not translating to the right end of the curve. You may be right, but I’ve yet to see it lose it’s correlation in multivariate regression models. In fact, I’d add initial income to the model to control for average or low IQ individuals who happen to already be wealthy, decreasing the relationship with IQ. This of course if we’re measuring earning potential.

My issue with IQ is it isn’t a great measure of intelligence. It focuses heavily on pattern recognition and a certainty type of problem solving. That isn’t to say that it isn’t a useable measure, just one that can’t strictly describe “intelligence”. While I would consider anyone with a high IQ intelligent, I wouldn’t necessarily say the opposite for those who score low.",2021-04-01 15:22:22
Ready2gambleboomer,"This sounds like I'm full of it but here goes....when I was a kid still in HS I took my first stats class on the way to a corporate finance/accounting career.  One of my first jobs was as a book keeper for a rich small business guy (I had a CPA auditing my work) and I started trading as a young retard.  My mom helped me open my account.  All these guys were into the stock market, real estate etc.

At 15 I developed an idea I called channel analysis.  Essentially the same idea that later in the 80's made John Bollenger famous with his bands....stocks run in a channel...the bell curve ...two standard deviations etc.  It's the same idea that later was on the Net at [ChannelingStocks.com](https://ChannelingStocks.com).

If you're asking about the hard courses like Finance or OC10/20 I'd say to have a good set of friends you can study with. ALWAYS take classes with Syed Ahmed for those courses, because he's not easy, but he is fair. And he helps people who are confused about topics for sure.

GoinGoinGon3,"Short answer: I think you got it covered. No one. Everyone will buy if the relative cost of owning vs renting goes down. Landlords need a new job. Nothing new. Abacus operators lost their jobs. Just gotta stop whining and innovate. 

Long answer:

Imagine a situation where house is 100k. Taxes are 12k if you are an investor and 0k if you are homeowner. Costs of renting are automatically 1k more per month. This 1k is either hitting the landlord which lowers supply of rentals or tenants which is lowering demand. Either way, you move towards owner occupancy and fewer rentals. Sucks for us but I really don't know if it would be that unpopular. As I pointed out Singapore does this and they have really high home ownership rates. 

Not everyone can afford 100k even if they want to stay put and don't mind sewer diving because it involves the downpayment or have credit access because of redlining and all this profit driven bullshit assholes in our industry do. 

So if renting costs that extra 1k monthly (if costs pass completely to tenant) but they can't afford the 20k downpayment, then they are stuck with the higher rentals as many correctly pointed out. 

As I was saying, it is a mix of outcomes. 

A homebuyer will outbid a landlord because his ownership costs are 12k lower. Make it PV with your favourite excel sheet... and put a nice sounding finance term on it. It will happen even if we don't like it. Or, a landlord in distress who can't collect rent can't deal with the higher taxes and wants to sell. No other landlord wants it, but OO with the 12k advantage can do cash for keys. It's that simple.

Which of these 2 effects are stronger... Not so clear. I answer questions like this for a living and it's really not that simple. I'd have to think hard. To answer it I won't have time to build and rent. All I know is regulations that hit us increase costs just like this 12k tax. It will simply drive landlords out of business. 

Rents go up, but only for a few. That fucking triangle in the supply demand curve gets small at the top after you take out deadweight loss. 

So my message to us is to stop being so simplistic about things. Rents go up, for few. Don't act as if we are the only folks capable of providing housing. If we do it jobs better than others, we keep our jobs if not we don't deserve it. 

If enough of us keep behaving like entitled whiny bitches instead of doing our jobs properly, we will get legislated out of existence because in case ya'll haven't noticed, we aren't that popular.",2021-04-03 03:10:33

NPRjunkieDC,"This applies to small and mid-cap too 

https://ragingbull.com/kb/how-to-make-money-with-penny-stocks/

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies. 

If you are using RH or WB that don't allow pennystocks there is a subreddit r/RobinHoodPennyStocks .
On NASDAQ many options like CTRM + SNDL + DGLY + HIMX + CIDM + NOK + ATOM+ ENG

Megahuts,"Here are my thoughts on Silver (and I have some way OTM calls on AG just in case my timing is wrong).

The past 2-3 years have been eerily similar to 2007-2008. Not enough for a perfect match, but enough to rhyme (yield curve inversion timing, liquidity issues, etc.)

Last time, the Fed took way too long to act. They didn't this time, and the additional fiscal stimulus is awesome as well.

However, based on the past 21 years, silver and gold have been cranking higher every time the Fed lowers rates (especially 2008 - 2011). So, just like ""last time"" I expect a spike in silver and gold prices at some point in the future. 

Note, it is possible (but unlikely) that funds flow into BTC, or NTF, instead.

For example, from a techical trading chart, gold has completed a cup over 8 years, and might be creating the handle to complete the pattern. Which is insanely bullish, should it complete and breakthrough on high volume. 

https://goldprice.org/gold-price-history.html

Silver's chart is not as nice, from a technical perspective.

How would you trade this?

Physical (or near physical PSLV).

Royalty (basically, not miners, but finance a copper mine and are paid in silver, can't recall the names) 

Miners (Barrick, First Majestic, etc)

Junior miners (on the TSX venture, I have NO idea which ones)

I did most of my reading in the 2011 - 2013 bull market in gold and silver, but didn't bother acting as it seemed played out.

I do plan to act, but I am tied up in Steel.

If they are still around, I will reactivate my sub to Casey's Research.

In terms of returns, juniors are basically your penny stocks, and can really deliver major returns. (similar to drug development clinical trial progression). This is where you would get your 10x to 1000x returns...or losses.

Miners and royalty are way better than physical (unless you want physical), as they are also leveraged to the price. Plus, they pay dividends.

So, as to how to play it, it is your call.

But I still think it is pretty early. (though there have been some significant option buys on SLV and GLD.)",2021-04-04 10:16:25
Prahasaurus,"A couple of points/questions.

1 - Do you think this will be a gradual squeeze, or something similar to a Black Friday event where the SEC or Justice drops the hammer on crypto in one major swoop? 

2 - If it's the hammer, what is the timing?  Don't you think this will take a lot of time to prepare, especially with a new Administration bogged down with other issues?

3 - When I talk to senior people around Finance, they seem to have no clue of crypto.  I mean, it's actually quite stunning.  Don't you think there will be a major learning curve before anything happens?  Right now they can't even spell DeFi.

Wide-Fox-1076,"Similar NW. I’ve earned money through RE, growing a business, and investing in digital currency. Like you I appreciate simplicity. However given the current economic and political climate I believe you need to have multiple income streams in retirement to combat inflation. I believe owning stocks, bonds, real estate measured in usd right now isn’t a smart bet. Our true inflation rate for the next four years is 10-15%. A stock may seem like it performs well at 10%. But if it is measured in usd and our currency is being debased by more than that, what does that buy?  Everything you want to buy is getting more expensive. 

I would suggest holding onto some of your best real estate and handing it off to a good company to manage. This will provide good monthly cash flow with low risk and little to no work from you. Rents will rise but do note that these will lose some value over time from the usd currency devaluation going on. However I do think it is nice to have the income from the properties covering your living costs. It also smooths out curves from volatile markets in down turns. 

Next I truly believe in the next 12-18 months you will reliably be able to earn a good return off crypto currency. You can either hold it with a bank like fidelity and earn a yield or borrow money each year against your holding and use that to live off of. You do this to hold onto your crypto without selling it. I believe as the usd devalues alternative stores of value will rise, primarily over the next 3-4 years. I believe having a large position in Bitcoin specifically is a smart play. 

Lastly if you want to diversify read Ray Dalio’s recent paper about where he would invest money. I believe he said something like foreign markets non security risk assets blah blah. Not even sure what those are. Basically he is also saying avoid us stocks, bonds and real estate without trying to outright say Bitcoin. 

Whatever you decide $10m has a lot of buying power now, but probably not forever.  I personally don’t think buying a total stock market index will work anymore as the money printing curve is rising exponentially. Even high network effect stocks like Amazon and apple with struggle to keep up. You have nothing but time now to start listening to podcasts and videos about finance. Those will help you with your decision. And please no bonds!!",2021-04-05 03:32:50

PapaMurphy2000,"That applies if you buy a NEW boat. Which is probably the single dumbest thing one can do financially. And then finance it with a 20 year loan at 5 or 6%. DUMB DUMB DUMB!!

Boats depreciate crazy fast in the first few years and then flatline quickly. A well maintained boat can last 30 years easily. So to own a boat and not get killed buy a 5-10 year old boat that is already on the flatline of the depreciation curve. That means you can then sell it for more or less what you paid for it in the future. Your cost of ownership is then maintenance and storage.

I bought such a boat for $20K, 5 years ago. I could sell that boat for $25K today since the price of used boats skyrocketed last year during Covid. It costs me $3500 a year for moorage/storage and on average $1000 a year in maintenance, repairs and insurance. So call it $5K a year. To rent a boat like mine costs $500-700 a day. Plus the hassle of having to go rent it, fill out paperwork, etc, vs drive 10 minutes to the marina and jump on the boat. And I use it a lot more than 8-10 times a summer. I'm on that boat at least 3 days a week. Not for a full day. It's great to go out for a couple of hours in the evening, watch the sunset over the lake, or go to dinner on one of the lake restaurants.

theaman1515,"The BA and BS are very different, BS is much more Quant focused, so thats an important consideration.

Econ at UMD is pretty solid, however it's definitely not a ""walk-in-the-park"" like it is at some other schools. Many of the 300 and 400 level econs are graded incredibly harshly and you have to put in a lot of work to keep up. I saw final class averages in 305 and 306 (both required for BA) that were ~70%, meaning almost half of the student's had to retake. Likewise, I had many times where the average grade on a final or midterm was &lt;50%, but they do curve that. At many schools Econ is almost treated as the degree that you fall into if you don't get into the business school, but at UMD it is significantly more difficult than any of the business degrees. The only issue here is that you're often competing with many of the Smith school kids when applying to jobs, and your ECON GPA is likely going to be a good bit lower than the average Finance/Accounting/Management student's, so if the company doesn't really value that econ background you'll find it difficult to compete.

spartyfan1,"I'll drop my 2 cents here. (8 years in global procurement with an education in supply chain). 

First question: What is your long term goal? Why do you want to be good at many different functions/fields of a company? 

The issue you will run into by moving to another function is that you will have to start over again. Moving from procurement to finance? There will be a a learning curve due to different KPI's AND most importantly the different definition of spend between the two functions. 

Procurement is a field that will be growing fast over the next few years especially when it comes to big data. The systems and processes are antiquated and the entire globe is trying to figure out how to modernize it. Some companies haven't even tapped into the power of RFID tags to track material movement! What about the power of block chain? Advanced data analytics? ML/AI in predicting future disasters to adjust decision making. 

Procurement covers a very important aspect of business operations. Specifically managing 1) the cost of goods sold and 2) supplier relationships (in case of covid will your suppliers help you) and 3) most importantly supply chain risk. In your global role, YOUR understanding of your suppliers and supply market is what will make or break your company. It is always never seen as important but you know who is called on when shit like covid hits the fan? You are my friend hahaha.

To answer your question: Will you be stuck in procurment if you continue down the path? Most likely. But you can pivot into sooo many areas of the new world of procurement (Check out Merck's new procurement process that uses AI to predict world disasters to mitigate risk, or Haier's real time feedback flow from customer issues to procurement without having to wait for engineer reviews, or even how blockchain can provide material flow/quality issue/supplier management possibilities that sound futuristic).

holyoak,"&gt; and there isn't even one. ONE! that has hung around for a long time and actually gained against bitcoin in all that time.

The entire top 100 has gained against BTC.

BTC had not gained wide acceptance; we are still very early in the curve.  Many problems (such as high fees, blockchain transparency, slow confirmations, centralized miners) still need to be overcome before BTC can see mass adoption.

Then there is the simpler argument against maximalism; people use, and always have used, different types of money.  Hopefully you have change in your pocket, a 401k, and a credit card.  These are all money, but in functionally different forms that are implemented based on specific use cases.  To say that BTC is going to dominate **all** use cases is naive in terms of history.

romeotangoxray,"There is a sweet spot for the price level of FIL, where miners are still able to earn a decent ROI quickly enough, without having to tie up unreasonable amounts of cash for years at a time, due to the staking requirements for each TB of storage.

Read up on the history of how Protocol Labs had to change the vesting schedule for rewards, to allow a larger percentage to be cashed out earlier. Otherwise, a substantial number of miners would not have had sufficient financing to fully deploy their capabilities, without risk of running out of cash before vesting enough to pay back their loans.

I picked out $40/FIL because that's where the introductory price level was at back when mining was still accessible to smaller operators - without having to obtain large loans to finance the staking requirements.

If FIL were to stay on a parabolic growth curve, and reach $1,000+/coin, how is that healthy for the long-term addition of more miners?

proverbialbunny,"&gt;Low Volatility Anomaly:
&gt;
&gt;The observation that low volatility stocks have higher returns than high volatility stocks in most markets studies. This is an example of a stock market anomaly since it contradicts the usual prediction that higher risk always equals higher returns. 

This is not true.  The first study it uses as a source cherry picks data and the second study states, ""One commonly heard concern with low-risk investing is that the sizable assets in dedicated low-risk ETFs nowadays may imply that the anomaly is rapidly being arbitraged away.""

What is this anomaly?  That investing in non-tech stocks from 1990 to 2002, which were lower volatility, made more during this time.

In finance classes once of the first things you're taught is called portfolio management.  Within that is a gem called portfolio theory.  Here is a link to a MIT lecture about the topic, if curious: https://youtu.be/8TJQhQ2GZ0Y

To summarize the topic, there is an efficiency curve when picking a stock or etf.  This curve says what the max profit you can receive in a time frame given how much volatility it experiences.  The more volatile (which means larger up and down movement) the more potential for a max profit. 

Some sectors have medium-high volatility but only medium returns, eg REITs and therefore are generally not considered an ideal buy, as you're adding unnecessary volatility to your portfolio and getting nothing of it.  

One of the consistent highest performers in gains to volatility out there is VOO, which is why it may be the \#1 invested ETF in the world.  VOO would make 9-11% annually for the last 100 years, if it went back that far.  The last decade has been especially generous averaging 14-16% returns.  On the volatility side at the bottom of a recession it regularly bottoms out at about 45% from top, sometimes hitting 50% in an extreme case.  

Can someone make more than VOO?  Absolutely but at the cost of more volatility, and how much more volatility determines how worthwhile it is of a buy.  You can buy ETFs that lose up to 90% during a dip, let alone a recession, but as you can guess they make a ton more than VOO.  Is this a good idea?  Probably not, as most people can not stomach those kinds of losses and will end up selling low.  

Likewise in the other direction you can have reduced volatility and reduced profits.  Again, the trick is to find the edge of the curve so you're maximizing profit per volatility.  Going back to REITs, they make less than VOO but their volatility is also lower than VOO but only by a little bit.  One of the reasons VOO is so popular is it's hard to find ETFs that make less and have proportional volatility.  Most low volatility funds significantly under perform when it comes to profits.  Eg, investing in a world-wide emerging markets ETF.  You will make less, and your volatility will be less, but you're not at the end of the curve maximizing profit per volatility.  Even gold's volatility is too high given how much it makes.

In fact, if anyone here can find an ETF that under performs VOO, by a reasonable bit, not flat lines, but has volatility not in excess, I'd be rather impressed.  It's not easy to find a high performing low volatility ETF and for good reason, this article is bull.

So, say VOO is too volatile for you, so you want to reduce volatility but maximize profits in relation to that volatility.  What do you do?  Do you buy a lower volatility ETF with lower profits, even if it has higher volatility in relation to profits?  No.  Instead, you only hold a percent of your holdings in VOO.  If you hold 66% in VOO you have 1/3rd less volatility but 1/3rd less profits.  You can also diversify, but a dirty little secret today is most ETFs all over the world line up with VOO.  If VOO goes down so do they so you're not reducing volatility.  You have to find what is called a low ß (beta) ETF to properly diversify.",2021-04-14 13:37:04
mctheebs,"&gt;""What was your wage when you were toiling away gutting fish or using a crosscut saw and axe? What year was it when you were earning that wage?"" I was making $100 a week cutting trees: averaged about $2 an hour. Pretty good pay at the time in 1966 for a 20 year old. In 1964 I worked a fishing boat out of Port-aux-basque. I averaged $300 a voyage, about $50-70 a week.

So at 20 years old in 1966 you were earning $817.52 in today's money ([calculated using this calculator](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/)). The median wage a 20-24 year old earns today is [$640.00 a week](https://smartasset.com/retirement/the-average-salary-by-age). So you were making about 30% more than the average 20 year old earns today. Moreover, things have gotten more expensive in that time,[ so the average wage actually buys *less* today than it does in 1966.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/) 

Now you might be thinking ""well, workers need to *work* more if they want to get paid more."" Well, workers are actually [*far more* productive than they are today than they were in 1966, but are seeing a smaller and smaller cut of the profits they are generating for their employers](https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/). This is because a larger and larger share of the profits have gone to [skyrocketing executive compensation instead of the average worker.](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/20/how-much-money-ceos-have-earned-over-the-years.html)

&gt; How old were you when you bought your first house? I was 40 when I bought my first house: paid cash.

&gt; How much did that first house cost? $69,950 (plus all the taxes &amp; add ons)

[So the average age of firstime homeowners 34 years old](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/research/average-age-to-buy-a-house/), so you were actually behind the curve buying your first house at 40. However, you also did not mortgage your home and instead bought it with cash, which is very much not the norm in 2021. In fact, people who are in the 40-55 year old range actually have the largest amount of mortgage debt, averaging at $247,564, which is $40,000 than the national average.

Your first house cost $69,950 in 1985 dollars, which is only $172,194.67 in 2021 dollars. [The average price of a house in 2021 is $408,800.00](https://www.statista.com/statistics/240991/average-sales-prices-of-new-homes-sold-in-the-us/#:~:text=After%20plateauing%20between%202017%20and,it%20reached%20408%2C800%20U.S.%20dollars.). Of course, averages are skewed by the highest and lowest prices on the market, so let's check the median.[ The median price of houses leading up to 2021 was $340,000](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/real-estate/housing-trends), still substantially higher than the price you paid for your house in 2021 dollars.

&gt;What was the interest rate offered on your first savings account? I was 6 years old, and my mother set it up, but I'll guess it was around 1.5-1.7 percent.

1.5% is a great interest rate for a saving account. [The average savings account interest rate in 2021 is a princely .04%](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/average-savings-account-interest-rate#:~:text=The%20average%20savings%20account%20in,to%20data%20from%20the%20FDIC.)

So you grew up in a time where wages were higher, consumer goods were cheaper, where workers got a larger percentage of the profits they were generating for their employers, where big ticket items like houses were *significantly* cheaper, and where savings accounts actually offered a decent amount of interest.

Do you understand now how your view of things is a little naive considering your frame of reference was vastly different in terms of how much things cost and how much people were compensated for their labor? In 2021, you can't just stick your money in a savings account and rack up the compound interest because the interest afforded is a laughablely insulting pittance.

I would use one sheet per module, with 50-something modules in all. On occasion the Schweser videos were missing some part of the curriculum (maybe 5% in all).

&amp;#x200B;

Just some articles I came across tonight outlining the supply constraints large auto manufacturers are dealing with due to their short-sightedness.

I'm trying to change how you think about this situation, rather than convince you that you're wrong. Think of what is happening:

* [Consumer demand statistics](https://www.cjponyparts.com/resources/mustang-sales-throughout-years) do not support the argument that there has been an expansion of demand for mustangs.
* Supply constraints will lead to a contraction of the supply curve. This is based on the [Law of Supply](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/supply-demand-equilibrium/supply-curve-tutorial/a/law-of-supply). In fact, how about you click [this link](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/supply-demand-equilibrium/supply-curve-tutorial/a/what-factors-change-supply) and work your way through factors that affect supply curves. There is even an example question that is perfectly relevant. It discusses the price of steel and its impact on the cost of production of vehicles. This can be applied using the supplied articles. Instead of steel, it is semiconductors.

This is a teaching moment, so don't read this thinking, ""fuck it, I'll just say told ya so in a year."" Interpret it and try to understand the start to finish of the data.

Furthermore, if you are not well versed in supply/demand, the point about the supply curve here is that equilibrium prices are found in the real world when the demand curve intersects the supply curve. So that's what I am trying to say. The price is going to increase because of the supply shortage. This doesn't even consider the supply shortage of other raw materials.

Once supply picks back up to meet consumer demand, the prices will come down. Not sure if the used car market is going to have an enormous influx of mustangs coming back in to downgrade/upgrade, but if that happens, the cost of mustangs will indeed go down. You would then get to say you were indirectly correct. So it's not about being right or wrong, it's about understanding why the price movements occur. Eventually both of us will be right in the long run.... However, I'm still of the opinion that the fiscal stimulus and expansive monetary policy will put upwards pressure on these assets in general, independent from supply/demand factors.",2021-04-15 14:24:17
MachineTeaching,"Well, sort of, but not really.

Taxes discourage whatever they tax, consumption taxes like a sales tax reduce consumption, taxes on labor income reduce the labor supply, etc.

So yes, broad cuts to for example labor income can help stimulate the economy.

But it's important to keep other factors in mind. For example, higher incomes lead to a lower marginal propensity to consume. This basically means that a comparable tax cut for someone rich does relatively less than the same tax cut for someone poor as far as consumption is concerned.

Trickle down economics isn't really a theory but rather policy proposals that say we should cut taxes on the rich and businesses. This isn't the same as broad tax cuts for ""everyone"".

It also carries other implications. The [laffer curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laffercurve.asp) for example. In practice, we're usually ""ahead"" of the peak of the laffer curve, meaning tax cuts *don't* increase revenue.

And of course the trouble is that taxes finance things. Sure, lower taxes is ""better"", very broadly speaking. But if we take those taxes and spend them on things that improve the economy, that picture suddenly changes. And generally, government spending leads to *higher* growth. So less taxes, less spending, less growth.

We also don't see tax cuts for the rich improving the economy in practice. They lead to higher inequality, which causes its own issues, and the extra money also just get transferred to tax havens, so there really isn't much *to* trickle down, even if trickle down would work otherwise.

Tax cuts have other issues if we're talking about tools to help during recessions. Taxes are generally slow to change and hard to raise, cutting taxes during downturns and raising them during booms is just not very politically feasible. That's why governments rather increase spending for example.",2021-04-15 18:29:20

anonuman,"This is called ""buying on contract"" and can be a GREAT way to purchase an asset (home, business, property, etc).  STRONGLY disagree with u/freevoodoo that this is necessarily a scam, and very much agree with u/Particular-Earth-453 that the legal lay out is critical.

Traditional lenders (banks) are said to ""only lend money when you don't need it"".  Having the seller finance the deal is an alternative.  This can be mutually beneficial to both the buyer and the seller.  The seller gets several benefits:  buyer incentivized to take better care of the property, buyer has higher incentive to maintain payments, and seller has collateral if the buyer defaults with a relatively low cost to recover (compared to the bank).

The buyer gets several benefits: low cost of entry to home ownership, option to buy out at any time, limited exposure to decreasing values.

If the value of the property was agreed at $100,000, and the seller offered to sell on contract, a deal might look like $2,500 upfront, $1,200/month for rent/insurance, $100 month to maintain the contract.  This is basically first month, last month, and $1,200/year to maintain the right to buy out.

Typical reasons for using a seller's contract vs traditional bank financing would be that the property is distressed (and the bank will not finance until repairs are made), that the property will not appraise (atypical architecture, remote with lack of comps, etc), or that the buyer has poor credit.  All of these have a high probability of resolving within a couple a few years, allowing the buyer to buy out the contract with traditional lending.

Negotiation points to watch for:  up front fee is the most obvious, but can be mitigated with negotiated terms that allow for the fee (or a portion) to roll in to the purchase at the buy out.  For example, a buyer wants to buy 20 acres for their horses.  There is no structure and the buyer is willing to add fences.  Value of $100,000 is defined as prohibitive, so buyer and seller create a contract.  Seller asks for $20,000 up front fee.  Ouch!  BUT buyer negotiates that $19,000 goes to purchase when contract is bought out.  Depends on the buyer and the seller.

The other point is period or term of the agreement.  Be careful about mandatory termination within a few years.  Markets fluctuate and cash flow always has the opportunity to make life challenging,  A longer term allows for more options and more ability to manage life's curve balls.

Seller's get a bad rep and are accused of ""predatory"" practices when they take a property back per the terms of the contract.  This is certainly a potential outcome, and none of the protections of a federally backed loan are in place, but a contract written and reviewed by an attorney should mitigate this.  

The biggest threat to this arrangement is the buyer's optimism.  ""I can fix that distressed house and have it ready to refi in 3 months, so a 1 year term is fine."". Or ""I can get my debt under control and my credit score from 550 to 700 in 2 years, so a 2 year term is fine."".  Both of these put the buyer in a pressure cooker.  The only way this kind of deal, properly executed and negotiated, can fail is if the buyer allows it to.",2021-04-16 00:01:14
littlepuccini,"Banks/finance aren't as glamourous as industrial capital, because they don't work directly with workers and products, but it is the largest sector and it is growing fast as a result of capital concentration and imperialism. Amazon is a monopoly retailer -- in 2019, the entire retail sector contributed [about 25% as much to US GDP](https://www.bts.gov/content/contributions-us-gross-domestic-product-gdp-selected-industries-billions-current-dollars) as finance/real estate. While retail, construction, and manufacturing roughly doubled from 1997 to 2019, finance and business services tripled.

You should never underestimate the power of the banks. Socialists tend to focus on strikes and unions, fighting the front-line employers, but remember that every increase in profitability is an increase that the banks benefit from as much as any other capitalist. For example, the war machine is a great mechanism for taking taxpayer money and diverting it to US capitalists in the ""defense"" industry but the banks also take their healthy cut, both through loans and partial ownership of the war industries, and by lending the state the money they spend on the war.

There is also another point which didn't apply in Lenin's day but is very relevant today: in a modern capitalist economy with fiat currency, the main means by which the money supply can expand to match production (to prevent deflation and crisis) is through bank loans, with the expansion being governed by each country's central bank. So economic growth requires increased debt, which requires more economic growth to pay the interest on, and so on. This means that there can never be an advanced capitalist country, save for one which brings in a common currency from abroad (like the individual Eurozone countries, and they have their own significant problems), which  is not heavily reliant on the banks to run their economy.

Not to mention that the central bank, like any other apparatus of the bourgeois state, often operates on the principle of increasing profits instead of their stated role of controlling inflation. For example, take a look at [this letter](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/2011-08-05-letter-from-trichet-and-fernandez-ordonez-to-zapateroen.pdf) from the ECB to the government of Spain during the debt crisis (similar ones were likely sent to Greece, Italy, Portugal, etc.), which demands an end to inflation-indexing of wages, not to control inflation (which is not a major issue given the small size of Spain compared to the European Common Market), but to stop them from being an ""obstacle to the adjustment of labour costs"" and ""hampering competitiveness"", banker-speak for lowering profits for investors. Or look at the American Fed's policy of combatting ""overheating"" (defined as any sustained increase in labour share) by raising interest rates to cause some deflation and unemployment and bring the labour share back down. In recent decades, the Phillips curve (the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment) has flattened in the United States, meaning their old excuse (of maintaining unemployment and restricting wage share to prevent inflation) is useless; but instead of reevaluating their policy, they have just come up with a new term to justify the same thing: using monetary policy to maintain profits.",2021-04-16 06:04:24

CGApe,"This is definitely not a dumb question, it's good to know what you're getting into before diving in head first.

&gt; I suppose I need to have a good knowledge of finance and trading other than programming skills to be good at algo trading, so where can I start learn?

**Your ideas will be generated mostly based on fundamental concepts in finance and trading**, so knowledge is required. This can be something basic like ""When people see stocks moving up, they pile in and buy, so they continue moving up"" (e.g. dogecoin). This is one of the most basic strategies people use called momentum, it works well in some markets. The opposite of this could be a mean reverting strategy. You could reason that a stock, bond, crypto, or other asset has some ""fair value"" and strong moves up or down in the short term are likely to revert at some point. (there is also a more advanced variant of this called a pairs trade, which is worth looking into)

Unfortunately programming knowhow alone will not help you. Code is just how you test and automate you strategy. There is an approach to idea generation called data mining, where coding skill will help you, but data mining has mixed results. Often times you end up finding some correlation or pattern that is just pure coincidence and will not persist.

You should also have basic trading ""street smarts"". Knowing different about order types, how leverage affects returns, what kinds of fees/taxes you are paying on each trade, etc, is important.

&gt; I tried to build some programs to follow some basic strategies, but with no results.

&gt; Have I to learn TA?

Most TA is complete bullshit. Not all, but most. With that being said, the strategy I trade with my own money would be considered technical, since it only uses price data as an input.

&gt; In your experience, is it a profitable sector? Or it's only good to get hired from a multinational to develop code for them? Do some of u are living with algo trading?

Don't be delusional about profits. The world's best money managers and hedege funds make about 20% per year over long periods of time. Cryptos have more volatility, so higher returns are to be expected, but I would still say that living off of an algo is a unlikely at best.

This next part is boring but important. Understanding the math behind compounding interest is key. My advice would be not to quit your day job, and insted work on algotrading on the side. Since you are not withdrawing any money from your bot, your returns will grow exponentially and you will be super rich in no time. Given the above example of 20% p.a. returns, you would double your money every 4 years.

&gt; Since I have no experience in finance world, but (I think) I have a good coding experience, how many months/years, in your opinion, can I be confident with algo trading and all the environment around this?

As I said before, coding is just about testing and automation. I would say that a year of casual studing of finance is enough to get over the overconfidence hump of the dunning-kruger curve. There are some great resources online. Check out some of the videos on the quantopian youtube channel. (RIP quantopian)

&gt; A saw a lot of strategies out there, I imagine that if them are public so are not profitable.. Am I wrong?

There are some ""open secret"" strategies that seem to keep working year after year. Something like trend following is an example of this. But most silver bullet trading systems are very flawed. Most anything you find online that goes something like ""buy 10 contracts when EMA A crosses EMA B and set a stoploss 50 points below your 
entry"", will not work very well. There might be some underlying concepts in there that are good, but things like position size need to be figured out based on things like 
historical volatilty, liquidity, and your personal risk tolerance.

If someone is trying to sell you a premade bot or strategy, it is most likely a scam.

&gt; Have I to study different things if I want to trade Cryptos or normal FIATS? Is crypto world profitable or it's too unpredictable for algo trading?

You need to learn the different properties of different markets. E.g. ""stocks tend to go up over the long term because the underlying companies are generating money"", or ""oil tends to be a mean reverting asset due to the balance of supply and demand"". This will help with idea generation.

Cryptos are a fun playground for algotrading. Low fees, liquid markets, plenty of assets to trade. I don't see anything wrong with starting out in cryptos and branching out.


Some general things I wish I knew when I started algo trading:

- **Trade slower rather than faster**. Fees are a bitch.

- **Diversification is a free lunch.** If your algo works well with BTC/USD, then it will probaly also work well with ETH/USD. This way you get the same profits, but less risk. The more assets you are trading the better.

- **Backtests can be deceiving.** There is too much to mention here, just know that backtests lie.

UnderGroundNinja2020,"Thank you this is what I waa after.  So I def consider my self a newbie but have enough understanding to use uniswap and stuff. I had no idea regarding the pools and not enough liquidity for executing the cross chain swaps.

Is there a different protocol that I can use to swap cross chain while avoiding centralized exchanges? I don't think there is much to my understanding,  I thought thorchain was the first of its kind,  erik Voorhees is how I found thor and he seems to think he will be huge....the price on rune has almost 3x in the last weeks which doesn't make sense if doesn't allow users to do its thing?

I'd prefer to not have to wrap my btc in order to make btc swaps... hence why I was hoping to use thor chain. I dont love thor chain it just appears to be the only one that you can swap decentralized without wrapping,  but apparently you can't actually do that just yet bc of the pools /funds issue you speak of.

Also unrelated new question, do you have insights on where or how I could get enough knowledge on using protocols like compound, curve in order to provide liquidity or other strategies to earn a % for passive income ?

I was trying to read up on yearn finance but it's complicated.  

Do you have any good strategies for someone willing to put in the time to earn passive income with yields, farming, providing liquidity ? It seems IL can really hurt you if you don't fully know what you're doing.  Which is definitely me",2021-04-17 06:23:58

Shatter_Hand,"Central banks are already researching stablecoins or “digital fiat”. Instead of a paper USD or paper British Pound, it’ll simply be a digital version. Think of an email bank statement instead of one sent to you by the post office. It’s far more cost efficient, environmentally friendly, auditable, and serviceable. 

Every country’s central bank sets their own interest rate. This rate is the rate banks borrow the money at. The money they borrow is lent into existence, and they in turn lend it to you for a business, a credit card, home, or car loan. They lend to everybody from individuals to hedge funds. DeFi is cutting that middle-man out. You are becoming the bank. 

Right now, DeFi has too much friction. We’ll define friction as: the number of steps to complete something. That will fall. Consider the friction of video streaming for example when it began in ~1996. You needed to have:

 - to own a 56k modem
 - to download a tcp/icp client
 - to download a media player
 - to find the website
 - to add batch files

The more friction, the higher the learning curve. Fast-forward to today, and everyone carries a dozen video streaming options with them in their pocket, assuming there’s a smart phone there. Two-year-old children literally know how to use it. DeFi is unusable for the masses right now, consider borrowing stablecoins currently:

There are no central bank stablecoins (besides China’s digital Yuan). There are middle men (USDC, Tether, etc) that hold fiat currency in reserves. The interest rate to borrow them against your collateral (your crypto) is ~9%. That’s too high. There’s a huge incentive for legacy finance to capture those profits and this market entirely, which they will, and are currently researching. If they don’t, then the first movers (China and their Yuan for example) are going to become far too powerful. It’s a necessity actually. 

So from here, you avoid the capital gains, hold your deflationary crypto, profit from the borrowing arbitrage, and buy like you normally would.

In February I bought a car for my wife (late Christmas gift) and borrowed stablecoins against my Ethereum collateral at 8.5% interest. It’s staked, so the staking rewards essentially offset the borrowed interest in this case. The car I bought from a dealer in Florida who accepted USDC as payment. It was a great decision, because Ethereum (my collateral) doubled, I avoided taxes and paid off the car, which ended up being free",2021-04-17 13:54:05
ausernamez001,"Hello, for fidelity, log into the site and type into the search box ""real time"".  This will lead you to an electronic agreement/form to full out which will give you live real time pricing.  It's free to do that, just gotta submit the electronic agreement/form.

Having real time quotes and charts is very useful for entry and exit.

Fidelity mobile app is lackluster in the charting aspect, so I would use a different app for charts, one that allows you to use indicators such as volume, rsi, vwap, etc.

I have etrade and fidelity.  Etrade charges commission on some things, but I like the layout and the charting works.  You can add 2 or 3 indicators on etrade charts.  There may be a funding requirement, I don't know as I had already had 30k of miscellaneous positions and set it up years ago.  Your mileage may vary.  

Td Ameritrade has their charting app that is called Think Or Swim.  The charts are advanced, many indicators can be added, and fill out same real time agreement on their site to activate real time quotes.
You can make an account on TD Ameritrade and just do not add funds, which allows you to utilize Think Or Swim.  It is somewhat advanced charting and there is a little learning curve, but if you set it up the way you want and save the workspace it will stay as you configured it (indicators, time frames etc) for each time you open the application again.  I use it on PC, haven't messed with the mobile app too much.

You going to need to.experiment a bit and get your stuff setup beforehand so you can just open the application and quickly check how the stock is moving.  There is a learning curve.

These are how you can follow the stock.movement and see what's happening in real time.  Yahoo has a slight delay from realtime, but it works halfway decent and gets the job done, so you could use yahoo finance page to get a view of movement and volume etc and then check fidelity app or ToS or etrade to see the actual real-time data.

If this squeezes, I don't think you will miss it, but you will want real time data to ensure you are looking at actual live activity and not delayed data.

Honestly, you just need to give yourself a crash course and learn by doing.  Play with the apps, see how they work, get your ducks in a row so you can access everything quickly and on the fly (because you said you check between meetings).

**UMich Ross vs USC Marshall**

Intended major: Business (probably marketing/business consulting. Not a Wall Street finance person)

**UMich Pros:**

* Ranked number 3 for undergrad business
* Amazing curriculum
* Kids seem more down to earth/less materialistic than USC, based on my interactions with both schools' students
* Great job placement/internships (I want to end up back on the east coast)
* Ann Arbor is one of the best college towns and I can see myself being decently happy there (also very safe).
* It’s UMich Ross holy shit 

**UMich Cons:**

* More expensive: Overall, I'd be paying the full 65K tuition, which increases each year. I'd probably take out 20K loans in total, which in the grand scheme of things, isn't too bad. Also, if I can somehow make 5K a year I could graduate debt free.
* I'd probably have to work over the summer/cannot take unpaid internships
* Really big (though there are way less students in Ross, so I'm not too concerned about class size?)
* Way less diverse: worried about finding an Asian community 

**USC Pros:**

* Cheaper: 30K Marshall-specific merit scholarship. I'd be paying around 50K and graduate debt free with possibly money for an MBA.
* Overall prestige (though less so than business)
* Warm weather and nice campus (in a city)
* Great job placement
* Good curriculum
* Good size

**USC Cons:**

* Ranked way lower (#12 for undergrad business) 
* I really dislike LA culture, which pervasive in USC. But it’s a huge school so ig not everyone subscribes to it.
* Far from home (I live on the east coast) but I can come back home a few times a year
* Job placement might be on the west coast, when I want to live on the east coast. Thought I’m sure I won’t have trouble finding a job with a Marshall degree.
* LA public transport sucks from what I hear
* Marshall curve (everyone competes against each other, a little snakey)
* My scholarship is dependent on me being a business major, so I can’t switch majors. But I can’t really see myself doing anything besides business.
* Outside of campus is a little dangerous but manageable.
* I heard business clubs (ie: consulting clubs, which I really want to do) are extremely exclusive
* Not really a target school for consulting? Idk if I’m correct.

psstein,"&gt;What can one do with a MA in history?

Quite a number of things. I work for a large consulting firm. It's really how you market what you can do and what your skills look like. Two of my major MA papers were on the implementation and development of medical technology and hospital system response to pandemic disease. 

&gt;Are there any good combinations to go with a MA in history to make one more marketable either in or out of academia? 

Finance, accounting, data analytics (if you want to leave academia). If you want to stay in: sociology, anthropology, economics

&gt;Have things changed in American academia in the past 2-3 years? Are things on the up and up or has COVID sent the job market spirally down even more than it was before?

The market has been in real trouble since 2008. COVID has simply dealt the death blow to an already fragile market. There have been a grand total of 4 European history jobs posted this entire year. 4. For a considerably sized field. The job market has gotten considerably worse over the last few years. Consistently, there are more PhDs graduating than there are available jobs. 

&gt; Lastly, do any of you have any other guidance or advice for a person like myself in this situation?

Don't go. If you must go, go to a top 10 PhD program (think: Ivy or equivalent, like Chicago or Berkeley). Anything else will put you so far behind the curve that it's not worth bothering with the necessary time to get a PhD. 

Your initial instincts were right, frankly. The history profession is dying, partly due to university admin choices, partly due to choices of the professional field. The market, which was bad when I went to grad school in 2017, is much worse now.",2021-04-18 13:49:35
Quentin__Tarantulino,"You’re at the beginning of an amazing journey. The things you can do with your crypto are amazing. Once decentralized finance can give someone a loan without putting up more collateral than the amount of the loan, the entire banking industry is going to flip on its head. It literally could change the world fundamentally. 

The division of wealth, power, world politics, all of it is at play. I think those who look at crypto as a casino where they might make easy cash are so short sighted.

Jimmykaner1979,"I think and obviously dont hold me to it but I believe that based on everything in the CURRENT market it will exceed $0.50 a share by end of year.

Veve, if it takes off correctly with current management and licensing and the AP starts to be able to perform with added users will be ahead of the curve in the NFT Collectible game.   

The fact that the end product is geared towards younger tech savy kids for the most part will make it in a sense a addictive behavior in the collectible world that kids will dump money into.

SRTHRTHDFGSEFHE,"For the past months i’ve been trying my best to do exactly what the government doesn’t want me to do with my stimulus checks: make them grow. Use them as a tool to break free of the day-in, day-out grind to make rent that has been my existence for far too long. Depression, addiction, loneliness, hopelessness, the list goes on. I know them all too well. But. COVID happened. I was given the gift of free time and free money. I got sober and healthy. Then the whole GameStop thing happened. I think that was a spark for many people. I made a little money in that event, but more importantly, I realized that I could make money in the market, and that it’s all a game, truly. That shift in my thinking about money in general was a revolution for me, figuring out how to play the money game became fun. Like a puzzle. Fast-forward a few months to now: I’ve been in the markets everyday, reading books on finance every day, obsessed, determined to make this happen. I made some money and lost some money. I’ve made good investments and bad investments, but I’ve learned so much in the process. One thing I know now: we can break the pattern that we’re all dying to get out of. It’s possible. I also know now that we, the human race, is on the brink of a financial revolution, if we’re not already in one. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain tech in general is going to radically change the way people do things- everything- and soon. Some of you might know way more than I do, and I apologize for the wall of text. Anyway- just to wrap this up: SafeMoon is the golden ticket in my mind. It’s a brand new, super cheap token that is just EXPLODING. It’s kind of like a 401k on steroids in that it pays you to hold onto it. I’ve gotten my whole family and all of my close friends on board. We’re all up at least 10%, and it’s only. just. beginning. rule #1: never risk more than you can lose. Rule #2 do your own research. Rule #3 don’t panic sell. Crypto is extremely volatile and you need to emotionally prepare yourself for that. Don’t act in fear. If you feel confident in an investment, don’t sell at a loss. Diamond hands. Head over to r/Safemoon, the Discord server, and Safemoon.net for info. P.s. There are plenty of other coins too, I just think that Safemoon is literally a once in a lifetime, life changing opportunity. No hyperbole. It’s too good to be true, but it’s true anyway. There’s no catch. I’m confident that I’ve figured out how to live the life I’ve always dreamed of, but never thought was possible. Teach yourself and your loved ones about crypto because now is the time to get ahead of the curve. Good luck to you all!

stylewithcoffee,"I'm a Junior w/ a cumulative 3.75 @ LUC (HS: 3.83), double-majoring in Finance/Economics, minor in Theology. The most succinct advice I can give is just to not do what a lot of Freshman do:

1. Don't spend your free time going crazy w/ parties and such. Socialization is important and healthy, but some weeks/weekends you'll have to sacrifice that to do really well.
2. Don't try to do too much. Joining a ton of extracurriculars right off the bat can easily be overwhelming. Dip your toes in the water w/ a few ECs that genuinely interest you; you can always join more later.
3. Don't get cocky. Some classes you can glide through and get an A, some you can't; often, it's hard to tell a class's overall difficulty curve early on. It's better to be on top of things in the beginning and you can relax later if it ends up being an easy ride.
4. Don't skip class (excessively). I've skipped plenty of times, Zoom and in-person, but you need to be smart about when you do it and making a habit of doing it often will not serve you well when you get to tougher classes.
5. Don't take classes that just check a box on your requirements. Try to find topics that you're passionate about (and also meet your requirements lol). If you really enjoy a class, you're probably going to do well (and boost your GPA) without really even trying. If you've got space in your schedule, maybe take some classes outside your major that just look interesting. Who knows, maybe you'll find something new that you really enjoy. That's basically how I wound up picking up my Theology minor.

_______ak,"Im an econ and finance major and for all of my intermediate econ/bus classes the averages on midterms were around 60-65 which is kinda confusing because, in my opinion, the material is  not even that hard if you put in some work. for example in my micro econ class, the exams are exactly like the hw/discussion handouts and people still get 60s on them, so the curve is huge. And I don’t think it’s about the classes not being taught well because I’ve had great professors. And exams test the exact stuff that we do in class so I don’t think there’s an issue with exams either. Honestly, I am as confused as you on this topic.",2021-04-20 10:55:36

a79j,"1. Academic achievements can either be with grades or via competitive examinations. Very high standardised test scores are looked at favourably, like an 800 GMAT for example. If you have something like an Olympiad medal for example or something equally impressive, those help.

 2. Please don’t listen to whoever told you a Bloomberg Market Concepts certificate helps make your application competition. Almost every single student studying Business and Finance has this credential. And it doesn’t mean anything. For certifications, something like the CFA, CMT etc are looked at favorably. But again, these are simply small accessories that help put you ahead of the curve. Non target + low GPA + no internships + CFA doesn’t mean anything. If you have all the other necessary boxes checked, a CFA can help distinguish you from other applicants who also have all the necessary boxes checked.

3. If you want high finance, the only advice I can give you is to try to get into a program at a target school and get good grades. Also, try to get relevant experience. The only other thing than this that is useful is networking.",2021-04-20 16:33:32

animalcrossingOG1994,"Hi!! I (27F) work in real estate PE and completely get what you’re saying and have certainly had my fair share of men who have either repeatedly excluded me from important calls/meetings, taken credit for my work, etc. 

It is really odd to me that he isn’t participating in your onboarding process at all. I would think that as the more senior analyst, onboarding new analysts would literally be part of his job description (or at least it has been for me in the past). If so, hopefully this is something he’ll have to address with your joint manager during any upcoming performance reviews. 

Like others have said, since you’re fairly new it does make sense that you would build up to more responsibility as time goes on. What DOESN’T make sense, however, is that it doesn’t really sound like he has any intention of helping you come up the curve despite the fact that that’s usually something that the more senior analyst helps with.

Depending on the dynamic that you and the other analyst have, it may make sense to say something to the effect of “Hey would you be able to loop me in on these calls? I would love to get more experience with [client, investor, broker, etc] calls” so that it’s clear that you’re genuinely eager to learn. Otherwise, assuming that you have regular meetings to catch up with your manager, you could also bring up your onboarding process and ask your manager what they would like you to have learned by a certain time, how they see your responsibilities growing, etc. Hopefully this would also open up the discussion to what you have/have not been learning, how to go about it, etc so it is clear to your manager that you’re making a sincere effort to come up to speed. 

Feel free to DM me if you’d like, most finance forums tend to be very male-dominated so I’ve found it helpful to speak with other women in the field.",2021-04-22 05:16:24
shibasteak,"New Zealand, which  I was fortunate enough to visit in pre-pandemic days, has always been  of interest to us. Culturally closer to Britain than modern-day  Australia, it has also been a fount of ideas.

Nearly  30 years ago the UK, desperate for a new policy after the humiliation  of Black Wednesday when sterling crashed out of the European exchange  rate mechanism, adopted inflation targeting, which New Zealand pioneered  in the 1980s.

Before  that there was intense interest among Tory ministers, MPs and think  tanks in the “Rogernomics” of New Zealand’s finance minister Roger  Douglas. It prescribed deregulation and a smaller welfare state. Before  that, again, the great New Zealand economist AW “Bill” Phillips, while  at the London School of Economics, not only invented one of  the most enduring concepts in economics, the Phillips curve  relationship between wage growth and unemployment, but also built the  Phillips machine, a working model of the economy in which the flow of  water around the economy replicates the flow of money around the  economy. Several of these magical machines still exist.

New  Zealand is innovating again, this time in its approach to house prices.  Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, having brought Covid-19 under  control, has been turning her attention to the housing market and  heading off what she described as the risk of a “dangerous” bubble.

Ardern  wanted to add house prices to the targets of the country’s central  bank, the Reserve Bank, in addition to price stability (1 to 3 per cent  inflation) and maximum sustainable employment. There will not be a  house-price target but the bank has been asked to pay more attention to  property prices in its decisions, to restrict interest-only mortgages  and examine how much mortgage debt in relation to income borrowers are  allowed to take on.

The  Ardern government, meanwhile, has taken direct action against what it  described as housing “speculators”: investors. The present position, in  which they are allowed to deduct mortgage interest from their tax  liabilities, will be phased out, and rules on the taxation of capital  gains from the sale of properties toughened up so investors will be  taxed more heavily.

The  government’s action has been brought about by a boom in house prices,  which have risen by more than 21 per cent over the past 12 months, and  by an extreme version of the UK’s buy-to-let problem. Here, the charge  was that landlords were squeezing out first-time buyers. There, with 40  per cent of properties having been bought by investors in recent weeks,  the problem is acute.

The  UK does not have 21 per cent house-price inflation, not since the early  2000s, but it certainly has plenty of it. The latest e.surv House Price  Index shows that prices in England and Wales rose by 8.6 per cent in  the 12 months to February, or 10.7 per cent excluding London and the  southeast. Prices boomed by 15.3 per cent in the southwest, which may or  may not reflect people wanting to shift their place of (home) work to  where they normally go on holiday, though they were also up by 11.5 per  cent in the northwest and 11.2 per cent in the East Midlands.

British  house prices have sailed through the pandemic and, indeed,  strengthened. The trend, of course, is firmly up. Prices have more than  tripled this century nationally, up 224 per cent. The financial crisis,  thought by some to be a watershed for the housing market, was anything  but. Prices have risen by 45 per cent since January 2010.

So,  should this country follow New Zealand’s example and act to control  house-price inflation? The trouble is that, looking at the array of  measures unveiled by the Ardern government, most are in place here. The  Mortgage Market Review is now quite long in the tooth but its emphasis  on responsible lending significantly toughened the criteria,  particularly on affordability, on which mortgages are advanced.

Interest-only  mortgages have been in sharp retreat in the UK, under regulatory  pressure, and now account for a small fraction of outstanding loans.  Landlords are still smarting from the assault on their tax privileges,  largely under George Osborne’s chancellorship, which went further than  New Zealand is proposing. Landlords, though, think they dodged a bullet  in Rishi Sunak’s budget this month, which was preceded by worries that  capital gains would be taxed as income.

It  is one thing to try to control house prices, however, another to  actively boost them. The chancellor may have eschewed capital gains tax  reforms but his cut in stamp duty, first announced last July and  extended this month, has boosted house prices. So has a 0.1 per cent  official interest rate and £450 billion of quantitative easing from the  Bank of England. Fiscal and monetary policy have combined to push house  prices higher, not bring them under control.

Is help at hand from market forces? A report from the London School of Economics, *The Pandemic and the Housing Market: a British Story,*  says that the long-term post-pandemic outlook for cities, including  London, is good, but warns of a short-term fall in house prices under  the impact of Brexit and the removal of pandemic support, including the  stamp duty cut.

George  Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, predicts a slowing market  as temporary support is removed but that an “outright correction”  should be avoided because the economy is bouncing back strongly, which  makes sense. However, with interest rates likely to gradually head  higher, in contrast to recent experience, “another multi-decade  super-cycle in house prices would be a stretch”. Falling interest rates  have preserved affordability even in the context of rising house prices,  in other words, but that cannot go on for ever.

We shall see. The LSE report says that after a temporary fall “in the long  run, unless the British planning system becomes less restrictive,  housing will remain unaffordable and increasingly so”. Even the Kiwis do  not have the answer to that.",2021-04-22 05:40:08

Accomplished-Diver19,"I don’t know anything about bankruptcy clerkships, so can’t give any advice on whether your bankruptcy would pigeon hole you. But I can say that it doesn’t sound like a bad option and I would give it serious thought if I had no other job prospects and was in your position. 

In general, I don’t think it’s a bad practice to go into—especially now. Outstanding corporate debt relative to GDP is at *extremely* high levels currently and many people in the know say this is a sign that bankruptcy practice will be in great shape in the coming years.

About the subject more generally, opinions may differ, but I have had some moderate exposure to it and have thought it is kind of it’s own beast. It’s a bit like learning a new language— you have different procedural rules, different names for things, and an entirely new process (creation of estate, automatic stay, trustee, etc.) that you probably learned nothing about in other classes. The bankruptcy code is also really not easy sit down and read. Needless to say, there’s a bit of a learning curve and it can be frustrating at times. But, on the other hand, it operates rather mechanically and it can be really rewarding/enjoyable when it clicks, imo, if you like that sort of thing. And if you’re not afraid of, or even good with, numbers then you may be really good at it. You have a background in CRE finance so it seems like you may fit that profile. Hope this helps and good luck.",2021-04-22 14:28:19
Badgaroo,"Sauda levels quicker than Churchill.

Aside from that completely agree. I've always said that Sauda's early game carry is a huge asset on the right map. Sure she doesn't work on all maps but neither does any hero, including Churchill. 

If you can get to lvl 40 with Sauda and a Carrier for example on maps like High Finance or Peninsula, you've wasted zero money *or space* on ""peripheral"" towers that will be useless late game. And you can stay ahead of the difficulty curve so easily with a start like that. Sure, other traditional strategies won't work as well but add in some stall (MOAB Presses and Impale) and put a Bloon Solver to double trigger her lvl 11 buff and all of a sudden Sauda is a huge force late game also. I like the fact she has opened up new viable strategies on maps like this, whilst for the purists, she doesn't really do much to dilute the difficulty of the true expert maps.

Etienne still my favourite followed by Sauda, Pat and Ezili. IMO Striker Jones is now far less good now that Mauler Spam is dead and dropped below these others, probably Quincy also. Churchill is fun and good on some modes but I find him so much harder to use in CHIMPS than all these others, and that is what I play 90% of the time.",2021-04-22 18:05:07

XCinnamonbun,"As a project manager in a software engineering industry product management seems pretty decent. It’s essentially project management but with a very long term ‘project’ which is nice because you can get really invested into the product. Whereas in project management you’re overseeing multiple fast paced projects. I suppose that also has its perks if you’re like me and like a ‘high level’ view instead of delving into technical details (I used to like the latter but having done a PhD and 3 years in industry it’d gotten too monotonous for my liking). 

The role seems to be well paid but I don’t really know what progression route you take once you want to move on from it. From what I can see product managers stay in that role for a very long time and those that move on from the role tend to just go up to head of product management (or something similar). The position is also highly technical, product managers are expected to know the product inside out and contribute to it technically. So you’ll be in for a steep learning curve if you’re background is finance and not coding/computer science. Not a problem if that’s what you’re looking for though, it’s not unusual for people to jump fields these days.

The grad scheme in the start up company could offer a lot of really valuable experience but it could also be completely overwhelming, chaotic and really put you off the tech field. Start ups also have a bad rep for overworking underpaid staff and having impossible expectations. You may find it easier than most to fall foul of impossible expectations given that this is a completely new industry to you and you don’t have a degree in the field. *However*, they are places where one minute you could be managing one project and the next you’re the director of sales. If you play your cards right in a start up that happens to take off the payout is huge career wise. It’s a big gamble that’s kinda equivalent to investing in a yolo stock like GME, you could end up rich or losing it all. Only you can decide whether the risk is something you fancy taking.",2021-04-23 06:12:43

HelpfulDudeWhoHelps,"I have continuously owned a full service Marketing firm for thirty years. MBA in marketing, BFA in Graphic Design, filmmaker and producer. We do strategy and execution. We used to work with a Fortune 100/500 but moved to midsized businesses because they were not as cutthroat. Small and midsized have little understanding or respect for marketing. They have wildly unrealistic expectations and don’t want to spend a dime. We did one of our early websites in 1996 for Briggs and Stratton. We used to bill $15k for a full page print ad. Now, we compete with secretaries and dudes in Bangladesh. 

Don’t take my word for it. Talk to people in the industry. It is brutal. I’m 58 and it is my biggest regret in life. And I’ve made good money. But at what price? I’ve watched the industry decline in value and become commoditized. The biggest issue is that executive teams think marketers are clowns, liars and have no hard skills. You won’t be taken seriously in the boardroom if they even let you in.

This is not just the cynical ravings of an old man, do some research. Marketing, as they teach it in school, is on a declining value curve. Just like creative fields. We used to charge thousands to design logos. Now, the price ranges from free to $100. We did marketing plans for six figures with 40-50% margins. We are lucky now to get any profit if we actually do a good job for a fraction of the fee.

If you enjoy low pay, short tenure, constant unrealistic pressure from people who have zero idea about marketing, then go forth. I would highly recommend doing some internships at marketing firms before you decide. I should have studied finance.

ConfidentYellow3799,"Sorry for the delay, I just saw your comment.  Finance and Economics 101: The ""purpose definition"" of a corporation (public) is ""to maximize the wealth of the shareholders"".  Nowhere in that definition does it state any timeframe.  My investment in BLSP is now several years old, and quite large - several million shares.    I knew from day one that I was investing in the future of mankind that I expect to unfold within my lifetime.  I am in my sixties. The risk is not so much in the dollars invested or even the timeframe, but in the ability of the company to eventually prosper from their technology and the move of the human race towards respecting the planet.  No, I am not an environmental ""nut"".  We (the human race) have and continue to produce more trash than anything else we produce.  Ultimately, it must get cleaned up (or at least the newly created trash must be minimized and recycled, or we will drown in our own garbage and detritus (shit) that our food supply creates.  There is simply not enough land or water on the planet for us to continue piling it all up, unused for any purpose.  We are at a time in man's history where the world is awakening to this reality and beginning to do something about it.  If you adjust your perception of BLSP's daily/weekly/monthly/yearly/etc. motivations for what they do, it will become apparent  that their stock price is an extremely low priority, especially given the market manipulations (like shorting good companies) that are very difficult, time consuming and expensive to battle against.  I am far less concerned about how BLSP treats the shareholders than I am about how they move this technology and their place within it to being proliferated out into the world.  I fully expected it to be shorted back into the .00s when it rose to .038 a short time ago.  Until the company and its technology are far enough along in being accepted as a mainstream staple of environmental management and energy production, any rise in the stock price will be countered by shorting (legitimate and illegal naked) by those players large enough to take advantage of small investor herd trading.  At the point where this technology and this company become mainstream (or very shortly before that is realized by the world on masse), the size of the long investor herd, combined with the large institutional and industrial investors that finally buy into it with a fervor that out paces the shorting abilities of the market criminals - THAT is when BLSP will ""go to the moon"".

eliterofler,"&gt;I've never seen Mitsubishi come up in awd discussions, but Subaru is almost always mentioned as having an always-on ""superior"" awd. Is it just that people are unaware due to Mitsubishi being fairly unpopular here? 


I think that's what it is, hell for the longest time I forgot that Mitsubishi even existed anymore in North America. How many people on this side of the Atlantic are familiar with Lancer Evolutions ripping it up in WRC, or the Pajero/Shogun tearing across the the Sahara in the Paris-Dakar?


My local Mitsubishi dealer used to be a *Suzuki* dealership, and how many people still remember those? Funny thing is after buying one I see the damn things (Mitsubishis) EVERYWHERE now.


&gt;The video you linked seems to be focusing on off-road performance 


Yeah for me the awd was more for off pavement performance, which those slip &amp; grip systems can still struggle with if they're not appropriately spec'd for the vehicle (Honda CRVs are especially bad)


&gt;control in ice-patchy conditions (which is what I mostly care about at this point). 


In my experience (Coquihalla highway in the winter), unless you have external traction aids (chains or studded tires, not just winter tires) when driving on ice, any drive train variables (2wd, 4x4, full time awd, slip &amp; grip awd) really doesn't make much difference, if you overcook it the car will go and stop where it wants to. 


&gt;I guess sometimes it can be better to suffer from a problem not being solved than to suffer from a sticky compromise. I hope that wasn't your experience and you're happy with the choice after all. 


Oh trust me, I have no regrets ""settling"" on the Mitsubishi. I wouldn't have done nearly 14,000km (55% of which have been on electricity) on it in 4 months if I wasn't happy with it.


When I had started researching the Mitsubishi after having ""settled"" on it, the more I learned the more I questioned why it wasn't higher on my list to begin with. Compared to the rav4 prime on paper it gets worse mileage and has a lower EV range, but unlike the rav4 it has DC fast charging so I actually have a reason to stop and recharge on my trips which lowers the fuel consumption a good amount. A 15-20 minute stop at a DC fast charger to stretch my legs, take a leak, and walk the dog gets me an 80% battery. So my long distance mileage winds up being fairly similar. Traveling to the Okanagan I can end my trip with fuel consumption in the sub 7L/100km range.


Or compared to the Wrangler as a crown land camping vehicle, the Mitsubishi has an on-board 1500W power inverter that can draw from the high voltage battery, while the jeep er... doesn't. So all my camping equipment is electric; a 1200w hotplate, a 1000w kettle, a 20ft extension cord, 1w LED string lights, etc. Idk how much the green 1lb propane bottles go for in your area, but in mine they're pushing $6-$7 EACH! Boiling 1L of water in the kettle takes up 1km of driving range. 


How is it that Mitsubishi of all companies is the one that got it so right? 


&gt;Car's value typically drops drastically within the first couple of years 


Imo, ""value"" only matters if you intend on reselling in a short time frame. I don't. I plan on driving this thing for ~10yrs so the depreciation curve didn't concern me too much.


&gt;Given how you mentioned deals and subsidies you're probably looking at this from a different angle? 


Yes, in British Columbia (metro Vancouver especially) with our higher gas prices ($1.499/L currently, telling us it'll crest $1.70/L by this summer) hybrid vehicles tend to hold hold their value pretty well. With used vehicles having higher interest rates along with not qualifying for government subsidies the price delta between a used or new one shrinks a considerable amount. The $4000 subsidy between the governments ($2500 fed, $1500 prov) basically covered the sales tax on the new vehicle, and the 0% interest on the new vehicle reduced the delta between a 40,000km+ 2yr old lease return another good amount. 


My line of thinking is if I can get sub 2% interest rates I'm willing to finance versus pay outright since inflation eats more than that value per year while allowing me to keep as much liquid capital on hand in order to better weather the slow times. 


&gt;As a software engineer, I'm used to this kind of interleaving and heavy-weight discussions. Makes me wonder if you work in a related area too or have a different source of inclination for this? 


Nah, I'm a machinist. Originally took mechanical engineering, learned I hated it by the end, then went into the trades after leveraging my CAD/CAM classes from mech eng.

We happen to be incarnate now, during the most, confronting, confounding and age-defining period in human history. The reason things needed to become unfamiliar and unhinged versus the good ol’ 70’s, 80’s into the 90’s - compared to neurotic, maladjusted social environment *today* seems to encapsulate is because the society that existed and was seemingly palatable most, was founded on some fundamental flaws that just weren’t sustainable to accommodate a culture, it’s associated collective consciousness has specced and engineered with much broader scope in mind.  

The native Australian’s were exploited and discarded because the elite stratagem for global subjugation is founded cultivating division. It happens everywhere, all the time. Not to diminish the plight of native Australians by any means.

All tyranny starts at the top in this illusory format regard ‘reality’.....the goodness is inherent in everyone of us, but prevailing hierarchy governing this realm have no utility for it. They shun it. Ascending their ranks denotes you’re either descended from an long line of *service to self*, Empire builders or you’ve engaged in heinous shit to claim your enhanced status.

The waters get muddy because those with deepest, darkest, looooong game intent, they have obvious insight into psychology and fickle and easy to manipulate it can be...any egoic or emotional trigger illicits an effect. 

Alternately, there’s overwhelming rest of us who aren’t  as informed or aware as to these basic triggers, making us susceptible to them.

The biggest curve ball mankind has/had to deal with is most us can’t begin to grasp the perspective and core drivers of elite inbred sociopaths. Considering the % of society that still turn their noses up at the notion of *elite inbred sociopaths*.... how do the honest, genuine, my brothers keeper, type human beings, that aren’t afforded hereditary advantage or inside info... how do those people begin to cognise the motivation and agenda of people concealed from their awareness - disseminating dark missives through networks of henchman in politics, media, finance, pharma... you name it.

Left field example - Nikola Tesla was amongst the greatest human minds. Acting on his Insight and direction would have changed society basically overnight with free energy devices etc.

dr_marx,"What do you mean by a difference? They both argued for socialism in one country, specifically in Russia. Both were a fantasy, both were an abandonment of world revolution. The difference was how this fantasy was going to use the peasants as a means to finance the state, which wasn't a choice at all.

Bukharin was a spineless charlatan. His justifications for socialism in one country has more to do with factional struggles inside of the Bolshevik party, rather than any meaningful proposals or ""theories"". 

The whole thing came around when Bukharin was in a bloc with Stalin, and he attacks everyone *but* Stalin, often attacking people for things that Stalin also did, such as taking the contrary view of Lenin in April 1917.

If you read them it's pretty obvious that Bukharin is laying out the model of Stalinist accusations and the great purge; by first setting up the ""Menshevik"" criticisms of the Bolsheviks, and then trying to undermine Bolsheviks by association. Often he will recite an argument (often ones that proved accurate) that he doesn't directly deal with because he can't argue against it, mostly around the weight of peasantry, then a little later, focuses on a something from the same critic he can argue against, hoping that the read can tie both in his mind, such as when the critic will say something outlandish. 

His criticism of Trotsky is just insinuation. He wrote

&gt;No matter how cunning, no matter how twisted, the resemblance, to put it modestly, strikes a nerve. Trotsky's position on the possibility of building socialism in our country (or, for that matter, on the nature of our revolution) is no less than a Russian translation of Bauer's social-democratic version. This is why it was possible that in the struggle with the Leninist Central Committee of the Russian Bolsheviks, Trotsky found himself in the same company as the now infamous renegade Korsch and his friends. After all, this honourable man, who preaches a crusade for the Russian revolution to atone for the sins of a communist fall, also saw, inspired by the grace of Kautsky, the bourgeois peasant character of our revolution, and now says that the Russian Bolsheviks are nurturing the sprouts of the new, American type of capitalism. What is so surprising about this? Since there is no proletarian state aid from the West, it is no wonder that the proletarian dictatorship is beginning to turn into a ""far from proletarian"" one, no wonder that it is ""slipping"" from its class rails. This is, after all, an elementary-simple conclusion from the Bauerian-Trotskyist premise...

The ellipsis is his. This is him ""having dealt with Trotsky"". 

He literally describes the construction of socialism in the USSR as an upward curve and has the gall to accuse others of being undialectical. The problems of the revolution were international, not internal, and it's the internal problems of the USSR that came to dominate the international. No matter how abstractly others want you to think about it.

But it's totally asinine to read all of these factional arguments, as if they actually meant anything, particularly if it's as openly shallow and political as Bukharin's here, and then to try to construct some sort of model out of it. Bukharin helped bury the revolution, and dorks asking questions or promoting or highlighting individuals like this just reveal how divorced from the real world they really are.",2021-04-27 10:05:33
toasterOnYourLeft,"(before I start, just a disclaimer that I am biased, I committed to McGill last week lol)

First thing you should keep in mind: both of these are excellent schools, and you will love your university experience regardless of which you choose; there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" choice, so don't let that weigh on you.

Second point, I think a lot of people on this sub get caught up in career opps, and ONLY career opps. Starting salary statistics and job reports are great, but that's not the only thing you should be considering. Especially when you're deciding between top schools, you're work ethic and other factors will be far greater determinants of graduation outcomes than which school you come from.

That being said, if you are dead set on investment banking, and making a shit ton of money is the primary driver of your decision (which there is nothing wrong with), then qc/ivey is def your best bet.

If that is not the case, then please do yourself a favour and look at every aspect of every school, beyond salaries. If you are smart, you will get the same job in the long-run no matter which you choose -- it might take a little bit longer with one, but these are 4 years of your life. So actually think about it.

Beyond employability, consider location, social life, program structure, academics, the types of people at each university, etc.
Do you prefer a small town like Kingston, or a big bilingial city like Montreal?
Do you want to jump straight into pure core business courses in first 2 years at queens, or have room to explore other interests at McGill?

Some things to note,
1.McGill is verryyy international-- i.e. you'll have classmates from the US, UK, Switzerland, Dubai, etc. etc.
2.Honours Investment Management has stellar placements (you apply after 2nd yr though, so don't weigh it too much)
3.Desautels institutes a faculty-wide curve, which could potentially bring you down, but tends to help a lot more than it hurts from what I've heard
4.QC stereotypes (don't over-think these, they won't define your student experience)
5. McGill places on par with Western and Queen's in terms of MBB consulting, and in fact places more than both for McKinsey specifically.

In conclusion, I really just want to emphasize that you shouldn't decide your university on just starting salaries or job reports; this sub can often self-perpetuate this notion that there is an objective tier list of schools that applies to everyone, and you are dumb if you go against it. That's just not true. I really suggest making a list of all the things that YOU are looking for in a university, and put down pros+cons for both McGill as well as Queen's. Don't pick one just because some highschool finance hardos told you to on the internet.

Hope this helped :)

sirprofit,"1.	it most likely won’t get you to the top table (I.e. as a board member) on its own. It’s widely viewed as a support/tertiary function although it is also relatively recession-proof.
2.	I’m in consulting - progression is pretty quick and salaries are decent. Compared to strategy and finance I’m paid less, but my salary is great compared to national average.
3.	lawyers advise on legal aspects while procurement focuses on commercial aspects of contracts. You won’t be expected to give legal advice but you will probably work with lawyers on contracts.
4.	varies but procurement is definitely not your law/investment banking type gig so you will be fine
5.	no I don’t agree - procurement hasn’t evolved much in over a decade and I’m looking forward to changes to be honest. The stuff that’s being digitised is all the boring administrative work which frees procurement up to work on more interesting stuff. Procurement is a very versatile role and a huge part of it is relationship mgmt and stakeholder mgmt. where are you going to find a robot to do that.
6.	Probably, but then I’ve always been pretty ambitious.l and have a very broad interest in business and finance. This is a personal question.
7.	what’s OPM?
8.	too broad of a question. Lots of the work is enjoyable and most categories are enjoyable and have interesting learning curve.
9.	consulting business but we have big corporate clients
10. Higher
11. Skills - you need to be good at analysing data and good at dealing with people. You also need to be a bit thick skinned (eg you can be tough in negotiations)
12. Join a mature procurement function don’t just take any procurement job. For example a lot of automotive companies have great procurement teams that work on interesting stuff and manage huge spends.
13. Yes, although in industry not much. As a consultant I’ve travelled quite a bit.

Procurement isn’t “top money” kind of field. The salary range is broad and you can definitely earn a good salary, but it’s not like law/consulting/IB/software dev at FAANG etc which is what I’d suggest if you are after the money",2021-04-27 17:51:54

LionSpiritual,"1. First semester might hit you pretty hard bc there's definitely more independent work required, but it's fine once you get used to it and learn how to manage your time well. 
2. Smaller class sizes are a game changer. There's definitely a better opportunity to build a relationship with your profs at Schulich than what I've experienced at my York classes, which can go a long way. As for the people, to be completely honest, some of them can kind of suck (arrogant, completely full of themselves, etc), but you'll def be able to find some nice people. With that being said, you're gonna find a good number of arrogant people in any business program you're at. 
3. School-life balance is good if you're good at managing your time and make a good, balanced schedule, especially in second year. Definitely don't take omis, accounting, and finance in the same semester (unless you hate yourself) because you're gonna be studying 35+ hours a week outside of class. With good time management and a balanced schedule, though, you should be able to do well with 20-25 hours a week of studying. 
4. I haven't seriously applied for internships, so I can't really speak on this question. 
5. Schulich has a fairly strict bell-curve requirement, so most classes you take will have C+ to B+ averages. With that being said, though, as long as you put in the work required, you should be able to finish most of your classes with an A. Everyone is gonna have different strategies to do well, but I would recommend a few things:
   1. Do your readings and take detailed notes on them. It may take a while, but it's gonna translate into deeper understanding of the course concepts and enable you to get higher grades. 
   2. Attend all of your classes and labs. Even if you feel that you're not really learning anything valuable in-class, since class sizes are so small, your profs will notice that you're there, which could work to your advantage. 
   3. Check RateMyProf before you register to a class. Some profs are just gonna suck and make it very difficult for you to do well. Don't make things hard for yourself. 
6. Schulich is mainly an accounting and marketing school. The math in core courses is very minimal and your introductory finance courses are gonna be far simpler than any other school. If you're looking to go into finance, IB, or consulting, you're prob better off going somewhere else.",2021-04-27 23:57:10
Nubraskan,"Well then I suppose we'll have to debate causes if/when inflation comes. Ha. 

This is one of the more exciting economic debates because I think we'll get a somewhat definitive answer on the outcome. It feels like most economic issues have ill-defined results and rationales to discuss post-mortem.

That said, I do think the fed will overshoot on inflation and struggle to control it in the coming years. Economic re-opening combined with fiscal pumping will begin to drive higher inflation. Yield curve control will be needed to continue to finance federal debt so higher rates won't be available to ""cool off"" the economy. 

This looks a lot like the 1940s war spending and YCC financing, which resulted in significant inflation spikes.",2021-04-28 03:50:18
-winston1984,"&gt; We are indoctrinated since kindergarten to think that way

C'mon dude this is a ridiculous statement. Your attitude reminds me of the anti vax attitude. Hear me out, I'm not trying to hyperbolize here. But the anti vax argument essentially goes something like ""we have never seen these diseases and all this medicine is forced on us"" but what they all fail to realize is that they grew up in a world that has already benefitted from vaccines. They don't see the disease in their regular life because it was eradicated before they were born. So in their mind the risk is minimal and the perceived risk of the vaccines is higher. What they don't see is that eliminating vaccines would bring it all back.

Similarly, your argument seems to be that because our system isn't perfect we should abandon it. The only reason we think it's good is that we have always been told so. But really, we were all born into this system and you're taking for granted anytime you or anyone close to you that has been in any serious condition and was able to just walk into a hospital or clinic and get treatment. Your example about the heart patient being ousted for a covid patient is disingenuous because that's happening everywhere. That's what the whole flatten the curve thing was about.

Furthermore, you appear to have the attitude of someone that has (and likely always had) the means to afford private healthcare. Many people don't, and a private system will literally ruin their lives. Plus, people have done the math on the American version and you spend less in taxes than you do on insurance and at least your taxes go to the healthcare and not some corporate asshole's pocket.

While I do actually agree with the idea of having a second tier (though it would need to be highly regulated) there are lots of valid arguments against it. The person above you made a good one about conservative governments doing what they do - defunding public institutions until they're so bad everyone uses private anyways, then they sell it all to the private industry. Plus there's a ton of details in the implementation as in fact each province handles it's healthcare differently. It's not actually a federal policy. I saw somewhere a case from Quebec and that's not representative of the entire country.

Ultimately, you are in a minority of Canadians that believe private &gt; public. Next time you start feeling this way go take a read thru American personal finance subreddits and see just how many of them are people giving advice on how to deal with their medical debt or tricks to reduce their hospital fees because they don't have insurance. Imagine that at any point you could hurt yourself or get sick and suddenly have debt comparable to student debt. That's the reality of private systems except for the rich.

Finally, this thread is about changing the American system to public, not whether we should introduce a private/public duality in Canada. So your arguments should be focused on that, which they don't seem to be, because there aren't really any good ones. So instead you're falling back to ""we should have both"".",2021-04-28 05:29:58

Zfusco,"It's easy to pay lip service to those ideas, but then move out of California because you don't like your tax burden. It's totally his perogative, but I do think it's pretty disingenuous.  

I think Joe is a pretty textbook libertarian on pretty much everything but finance, and in my opinion he's not a libertarian on finance because Andrew Yang is very charismatic and was every libertarian I know's ""I'd never vote for a democrat, but Andrew Yang is alright"" guy.

Which is fine, he's totally entitled to his opinion, but it's hard to deny Joe doesn't provide far more airtime to conservative/liberal viewpoints than he does left/liberal viewpoints. He's had some big name left/liberal democrat guests in the past, but lately those viewpoints are largely represented on his shows by pop culture figures with those views, but they're not as articulate, educated or convincing as people who make a career out of life in the political sphere. 

I agree right wing is generally associated with conservatism, especially in western politics, and even more so in American politics. I think the distinction between liberal and left is important, because you can be left wing and anti-liberal/authoritarian, like Maoists, Stalinists, etc. You can be a right wing and anti-liberal/authoritarian like Nazis, or pro Putin russians. 

I would define far left as the inflection point on the often talked about horshoe curve. If you go far enough in the left direction you end up with Stalinism or Maoism, people in camps, political prisoners, etc. If you go far enough right, you end up with Hitler and Fascism, people in camps, political prisoners, etc. 

Far left is represented by groups like Denmarks Socialist peoples party, Die Linke in Germany, Swedens The Left party. The distinction between the far left for me, and liberal democrats is largely when you're talking about an economic system other than capitalism. I don't think there are mainstream far left politicians active in American politics. Sanders and the DemSocialists are probably the closest, but they're not actively proposing abolishing capitalism. 

The Far right IMO is represented by the National front in the UK, Oathkeepers in the US, etc. Perhaps a bit harder to nail down a definition for IMO, because there are plenty of far right folks that want to ban all immigrants but are fine with receiving a stimulus check, and there are plenty that think Donald trump should be god king forever but don't hate black folks. 

It can obviously be more complex than that, and left vs authoritarian is probably better stated as collectivist vs authoritarian. But no one uses ""collectivist"" in american politics. 

Joe is decidedly not authoritarian. Historically speaking, the republican party was a classically liberal party, ""Keep the government out of as much as possible, let everyone do their own thing"". I think the distinction between liberal and left is important now, because in my opinion the american right wing is shifting from a liberal right wing party, to a authoritarian right wing party.",2021-04-29 02:35:39
ihatemendingwalls,"&gt; Fiat currency has no inherent value - it is valuable because someone tells you it is valuable, as opposed to something like gold or silver, which have real value.

Nothing in Oresme's argument did anything to defend this original assertion of yours. Gold's value is dependent on whether people want it or not, making it no less arbitrary than fiat currency. Only instead of fiat currency, its value can fluctuate wildly, in ways that a government can't control for the benefit of its citizens.  You mention that the source of his thesis was to dissuade the king from devaluing currency for his own benefit. Do you think that's why the Fed conducts expansionary monetary policy? The Fed is not politicians, it is separate from Congress, which is why economists distinguish between fiscal and monetary policy. The Fed expands the money supply in order to shift the aggregate demand curve to the right to compensate for an increase in the amount of goods and services in the economy (brought about by population growth or other increases in productivity). 

With regards to your request for a better understanding of monetary policy, I am honestly not sure where you are currently at, as your accusation of politicians printing money for their own use is wildly off base from any standard understanding of the Fed. I highly recommend Khan Academy's [series on the financial sector](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/macroeconomics/monetary-system-topic), especially the subset on banking, for a standard introduction",2021-04-29 03:45:32
NewtonCouple,"The pics are a bit on the blurry side to get a feel for how the visible marks actually look on the coins. Assuming best case scenario I don't see either exceeding a grade of MS64 and they could grade lower if the marks (namely in the right obverse field) on both coins are on the heavier side. If you got them free or for a low cost it might be worth it, but only if you send them in with a larger group of other coins because the fees and shipping are better distributed over multiple coins. Your starting point is $22/each plus $10 handling and shipping both (at least $15 each way) with either PCGS or NGC for economy which has a painfully long turnaround time.

Conversely, as mentioned by another user, you might be better off buying an already graded coin if that is what you're after. Otherwise, getting into the grading game takes a lot of ""tuition"", that is to say, the cost of the learning curve from getting coins back graded lower than you hoped, or with problems you didn't see, which costs as you sell for a loss in order to finance more purchases and grading attempts. It's the most effective method in my eyes for hands-on education regarding TPG grading habits but not for the faint of heart. An alternative is having someone else tape over already graded coins and seeing how accurate your grades are. The disadvantage is not having the coins raw in hand and IMO your brain doesn't form the same level of recall (it seems) as it does when you've paid to have the coin graded and you then spend hours studying it trying to sear the qualities of an inferior grade into your memory so you don't make the same mistake again!",2021-04-29 07:27:12
NQS4r6HPBEqn0o9,"Corporate tax is meaningless, only natural people should be taxed, people can't then combine their efforts to avoid taxes, like how Google for example would. 

That's how it works in NZ because of imputation credits and we have very high tax compliance, a very simple system, and if you're a shareholder in a business you're effectively taxed at your personal income tax rate. If you're a business giving fringe benefits to a natural person you get taxed on tax levied so no, people don't register as a business. 

I live in NZ, free healthcare, education, social safety net, government funded retirement and so forth. We also don't have guns in our schools. Do you think your government will actually put people first this time? 

I am smart, but the point you missed is that I have specific knowledge about accounting, finance and economics, you probably don't but you know what the laffer curve is, good. 
So answer this? 
Do you think there is a business out there that is a going concern that doesn't recover any and all costs including tax from the consumer?",2021-04-29 16:26:18
cbopp11,"I’m going into big law in a finance practice group and I did an MBA before law school. 

The degree definitely got some points, but I also had good grades and solid 1L summer work. I think it is kind of like a tie breaker. If everything else was the same and it was between me and a person without an MBA, I would get the nod for a transactional position. 

I think the biggest benefits are (1) understanding the more business centric areas of law like m&amp;a, corporate finance, etc. (2) having a talking point in interviews for why I actually wanted to do transactional work and (3) being able to hold a conversation about business or business adjacent topics [accounting, stock market, etc.]. Note that you can probably get these benefits (maybe not the first) by taking a class at the business school each semester and reading accounting for dummies and some basic stock intro books over a break. 

For a JD/MBA joint degree, my main consideration would be whether it added a year in law school (hard stop, don’t do it, opportunity cost etc.) and if you couldn’t still do legal work in your summers. If either of those are true, I don’t think it’s worth it. You can be successful as a transactional attorney without it, but you’ll have a bit steeper of a learning curve. 

Overall, I would say it’s not worth it unless it doesn’t require you take out significantly more loans and it doesn’t interfere with you gaining important legal experience early on.

I’m only happy with doing it because I was going to take a year to study for the LSAT and it was mostly paid for by scholarships. 

Hope this helps!",2021-04-29 22:44:07
jrkib8,"So I double majored in economy and finance, but sure nice try.

The economy is influenced by interest rates and inflation, but not driven, not at all. Ceteris perebus (a latin term you learn in econ meaning 'all things equal'), if you lower rates and increase money supply, inflation tends to go up, you are correct. The problem is, we don't live in a world that is stagnant.

For example, the phillips curve is a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment. So basically, as inflation goes up, unemployment tends to go down because the real cost of labor goes down for companies. Well what if unemployment is really high? People don't have disposable income and the uncertainty leads to a drop in consumer confidence and therefore spending. That can actually lead to deflation. Deflation is MUCH MUCH MUCH worse than inflation. So to combat that, pumping money into the economy and keeping rates low is essential, hence quantitative easing measures that got us out of the great recession.

The term for high unemployment and the ability to accelerate monetary and fiscal policy without risk of inflation is 'slack'. When there is a lot of slack in the economy, you actually need to tighten it up and a combination of keynesian and Friedman policies suggest fiscal spending and monetary easing. Which is what Biden is doing because of you forgot, the pandemic caused a global economic collapse (so there's a lot of slack)

Next time before putting on you big boy pants and calling someone economically illiterate, you should make sure you're not too big for your britches, and know wtf you're talking about",2021-04-29 23:13:29
