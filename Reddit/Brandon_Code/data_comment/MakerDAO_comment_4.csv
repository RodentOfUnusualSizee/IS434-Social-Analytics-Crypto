On Ethereum, you can always trade WBTC for Dai on Uniswap.

That's the most basic use case, but you can also lend WBTC and earn interest, or use WBTC as collateral to take out a loan.

March 2021: The Scalability Race heats up. Utterly bananas how rapidly this space is evolving. Just shows innovation can go into overdrive faster than anyone can imagine when the need is dire.

1st March: Optimism is coming this month! They have won this race!

A week later: Uh, oh, rumblings of a delay. But generalized ZK Rollups are years away, so no worries, Optimism will still win.

9th March: Matter Labs says generalized zkSync will become said generalized ZK Rollup ""faster than many think"".

10th March: MakerDAO announces Optimism Dai bridge with fast withdrawals.

16th March: Aztec launches, bringing scalability and privacy to ZK rollups.

22nd March: StarkWare announces ImmutableX now does ~9,600 TPS and public launch is imminent. Likewise with dYdX.

23rd March: Uniswap announces they will be on Optimism.

24th March: StarkWare raises a cool $75 million, three times more than Optimism, presumably to accelerate development of StarkNet, their generalized ZK rollup. Looks like generalized ZK Rollups might just land in 2021, after all.

25th March: Arbitrum announces they have a release candidate with BLS signature aggregation, commits to a fully public launch. Incidentally, Vitalik was in Optimism discord pushing them to support BLS just a day earlier.

A few hours later: Optimism confirms the delay, public launch delayed tentatively to July, though whitelisted projects like Uniswap and Synthetix come earlier.

27th March: Matter Labs drops the mic, generalized rollup zkSync 2.0 is done, public testnet in May 2021, public mainnet July 2021 if all goes well. Might I remind you until recently everyone (including Vitalik) thought a generalized ZK Rollup was years away.",2021-04-02 17:11:33

heavyweight0,"Makerdao, aave",2021-04-02 23:54:32
AusIV,"It's a little complicated.

When you send ETH, you can send ETH and invoke a contract at the same time. That makes it easy to send ETH between contracts and have the contract do something with the ETH that you sent it.

ERC20 tokens don't have that luxury. If you just send an ERC20 token, it gets sent to the contract you're sending it to, but the contract doesn't get to see that you sent it those tokens. If I just call `transfer()` on a token contract, the target receives the tokens, but it doesn't know it received the tokens, and there's not an easy way to establish that they came from me.

So ERC20 tokens came up with a different solution: Allowances. When you ""unlock"" a token, you're giving the target contract permission to withdraw that token from your account. Subsequently, when you make a call to the contract, it can use the allowance you set up to withdraw tokens from your account in the middle of its action (it can verify that you're allowed to do whatever it is you're sending tokens for, pull the tokens, then record that you've paid whatever you were paying for).

Now, there are a number of solutions to this poor UX. Some newer token types have an option to send tokens to a contract and have the token contract call a function on the target on your behalf. The target contract can verify that you permitted the action, and that it received the tokens. But the ERC20 was the first established standard, and there are several competing standards that solve this problem, so approvals are still the most reliable way to achieve this.

Interestingly, DAI has a feature where you can cryptographically sign a message to set approvals *without* having to send it as a message. I've used some sites where you sign a message then make a contract call, the signed message gets included with the contract call, and the allowances get set up in the same transaction as the contract call, which improves the UX a bit and saves on gas. I'm a bit confused why MakerDAO doesn't use that approach in their own applications when I've seen other places that use that model.",2021-04-03 00:49:41
BullToTheMoon,"Kinda. Uniswap and Sushiswap are exchanges. You add money to them and then you collect fees from people like me who would never use Binance or Coinswap as my exchange.  I can convert ETH to DAI, and you get a tiny fee. But when many people use it those fees add up and you get a reasonable return on your investment.

MakerDao, Compound and Aave are lending platforms. People borrow money and if you provide tokens then you collect interest. I've done this too.  I may want to borrow 1,000 DAI then use that to buy more Ethereum. But eventually, I gotta pay back that debt with interest.

I've only personally used MakerDao,Compound, and Uniswap.

MakerDao has the highest fees last I checked so I stopped using it. But they are the ones who create new  DAI, so it's really only worth using them if you have deep pockets.

omerag,"Not certain I understand the question but I'll give it a shot.

**Buying DAI through an exchange**  
DAI is a stable coin that is minted by MakerDAO. It's pegged (floating) to the US Dollar and its price should always be around $1 US dollar. In this scenario, barring any black swan events, you're pretty safe (as safe as can be in crypto) in knowing this will stay around $1.  
TLDR: No need to worry here  


**Borrowing DAI from Oasis**

You can also borrow DAI. How does this work? You head over to a lending protocol / website like Oasis, AAVE, Compound etc. and can borrow DAI when placing another token as collateral. For example, you can borrow DAI against ETH. Most protocols require an over collateralization of 150%. In this scenario, you need to be watching the price of ETH. If ETHs price is volatile and dips, you can lose your collaterilzation ratio of 150% and get liquidated.  
TLDR: Make sure you maintain the required collateral ratio

Aquinasinsight,"I see, to begin Cardano doesn't have smart contracts and just released it's native tokens. ETH has obviously get those for years already with different variations of naive tokens (erc20, erc223, erc 721).  The ecosystem of ETH, I don't know how many working projects are on there but it's well over one or two hundred. The biggest ones are in the NFT area like open sea and then there is DeFi with things like Uniswap, aave, synthetix, MakerDAO, etc.

Of course, ETH is moving to PoS like ADA started with, but then EIP 1559 is the next change to the monetary policy which will bring deflationary fee burning. Past that there are later two solutions such as Loopring, optimistic roll-ups and MATIC.

On the Enterprise level you have the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA) which is corporate partnerships with ETH. A lot of huge corporations there. Then the recent news of the Office of the comptroller said you can settle payments with banks using stablecoins on the ETH blockchain and visa using ETH and USDC later this year.

This is what people are referencing when they say first mover advantage and it is a very real thing because, ethereum has just had more time to develop these partnerships and relationships.

You can see that already starting to take place with cardano and it's Ethiopia partnership that should be coming out soon.

I think cardano has very good technology and is an aspiring project with a lot of smart minds working on it but it is going to take time for these things and these partnerships to develop, no matter how amazing the technology is this stuff doesn't happen overnight.

That's why earlier I was referring that cardano's real competition is the other smart contract platforms that have been around for a year or two not six years like eth.

Lazy_Physicist,"Risks regarding makerdao:

1. Smart contract risk - this is present for all defi contracts

2. Price risk, if eth crashes youll have one hour to pull your dai out of whatever and repay your loan or add more eth to provide enough collateral. If this happens during a period of high congestion you can expect to pay out the nose for the transaction costs. 

3. The stability rate can and probably will change in the future. It's based off of governance votes and if it changes that will change your overall returns and debt accrual. In the 3 months ive been doing this the eth-A stability rate went from 2.5% to 5.5%

4. There are minimum debt floors (minimum debt for a cdp) depending on the type of cdp you create. If this floor changes due to a governance vote be sure you understand how that affects your ability to mint more dai or payback your debt.

All of that said yes it seems like you've got a good handle on your risk. Fyi youll need to make sure you understand the collateralization ratio and when it will cause you to get liquidated. Personally i maintain a 500% collat ratio just because I'm very risk averse.

JizenM,"&gt; Do they sell your collateral?

If the value of your collateral keeps falling then eventually yes.

It will be similar to how MakerDAO works in that you can only borrow a certain percentage of the value of your collateral.

So depending on how volatile your underlying collateral is you may only be able to borrow say 50% - 60% of the value.

**This is still *amazing* in my view because you can use so many things that the banks won't accept as collateral for a loan, including the many different tokens that we love but aren't (yet! 😅) one of the top-3!** 😀",2021-04-06 05:00:38

Yes of course it is. 

This is no different than being one of the first investors in Facebook or Amazon, (or MakerDAO). 

Are you going to worry that Facebook or Amazon may issue more stock and therefore dilute your value? 

At least with $OPEN you can be 100% sure that there will **never** be more than 100 million tokens in circulation, so you can always use the *fully diluted market cap* as the basis of your valuation, if you want to be that conservative.

da-future-is-bright,"&gt;I don't think I've heard a single person actually explain the fundamentals of the network to me.

Cardano's (reddit) community has nearly quadrupled in size in the last few months, so lots of people still only know the basics (or want NGU) :P

&gt;One thing that I immediately am confused about is why delegation even exists for passive users

Traditional PoS has two shitty options:

1. Run your own validator - Slightly more profitable, but far too difficult for most people to do (well).

2. Stake via an exchange - Convenient, but slowly poisons the network. 

Ethereum fails to cater to the super-majority of potential stakers, because people broadly choose convenience and ignore harmful externalities. The end result will be an unhealthy network.

What if there were a third option?

3. Delegate your stake to community pools - Earn a much better rate with a comparably easy user experience.

Not only does this encourage community engagement and self-custody, but it makes option 1 far more attractive (!!!) since validators can make money from the capital that otherwise would have sat on Binance.

It seems counterintuitive, but allowing the passive users to delegate their stake to others actually improves decentralization. The economic incentives make perfect sense.

Alice's pool may have $100k 'pledged', earning $5k at 5% p/y. That's a nice passive income, but not enough to live on.

What if Alice can get $10m delegated to her pool? Alice takes a 3% fee, and suddenly is earning an extra $15k a year for no extra work (beyond being an engaged community member)

Suddenly Alice can work fewer hours at her regular job, and dedicate more time to growing the ecosystem.

($10m isn't much in a $40 billion ecosystem, let alone a multi-$trillion ecosystem)

&gt;if it has nothing to do with governance. How would those users vote, then?

Naturally, there will be different types of delegation.

People running network infra are not necessarily the best ones to decide on protocol changes or what research gets funded.

So in the end there will be stake delegation (validators) and vote delegation (protocol representatives) and perhaps others.

(there are spending keys, staking keys and voting keys)

Isn't MakerDAO working on delegative governance mechanisms? There is so much common ground between Cardano and Maker, but tribalism still reigns supreme.",2021-04-06 14:10:21

Coldsnap,"Hello Eth-fam, this is the weekly timeline update. Firstly, an announcement - the kind folks at Ethstaker.cc have offered this post a home! [Check this link](https://ethstaker.cc/category/ethosphere/) if you want to bookmark the timeline and always reference the latest version. I also can expand the post there as am not limited to 10k charas. That being said, I'll keep posting abridged here in r/ethfinance because why not?

I feel that this week seemed relatively quiet compared to last week with what seemed like every project in the L2 space giving insane roadmap updates, both positive and negative. We have some changes/confirmations this week though:

Protocol upgrades - The first of these, Berlin, upcoming on April 14th or 15th depending on your timezone, is on Rinkby testnet and still on track to go live according to [this week’s All Core Devs call](https://youtu.be/V-Qz4UN6Z88). There is a Cat Herders [viewing party](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/ethereum-berlin-upgrade-countdown-community-call-ffa51239c148) for those interested in watching it live with the various EIP authors, as well as a POAP-inclusive [Ethstaker viewing party too.](https://ethstaker.cc/berlin-hardfork-party/)

After that on the Eth1 side we still have the London upgrade scheduled for July. This has EIP-1559 of course and the good news here is that Besu, Geth and Nethermind are already syncing on testnet. The general dev consensus is that London is in a very good place this early on in the timeline. Definitely on track, integration testnet (named Aleut) [spec exists](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/client-integration-testnets/aleut.md).

After London will be Shanghai. The consideration at the moment is twofold… 1- should The Merge go into Shanghai, and 2 - if so, what does that mean for other EIPs in the backlog? If the intent is to deliver ‘minimum viable Merge’ that implies that other EIPs may not get delivered for quite some time (possibly 1 year+). Does that make sense? So there is a big discussion happening at the moment on what, if any, additional EIPs should be being considered for London, Shanghai, and the subsequent upgrade. I’d recommend checking out [the ACD call](https://youtu.be/V-Qz4UN6Z88) for the detail there, or follow [Tim Beiko on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1377980135484260352) u/DCinvestor has also [been posting](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/mho0ic/daily_general_discussion_april_1_2021/gt1lasq/) on this topic seeking community views.

While this discussion progresses, efforts on The Merge are accelerating. [Work towards a locked down spec](https://hackmd.io/@n0ble/ethereum_consensus_upgrade_mainnet_perspective) is going well. Community comms efforts [have started](https://ethmerge.com/). Everybody seems now to want to get it done - but not at the expense of 1559, mind you. Dev consensus seems to be that Merge efforts are in a good place, particularly after the first of the new bi-weekly [Merge dev calls.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3hfgLa_GHw) The only concerns are around client team resource - there is a lot of work compounding, particularly if decisions are taken to load up London and Shanghai with other EIPs. This is very ‘watch this space’. The roadmap will be highly enlightened once the [Rayonism](https://rayonism.io/) hackathon at ETHglobal has taken place April/May. This is where the Eth1 and 2 client teams will be attempting to hack together a testnet Merge and Sharding with rollups if all goes well. Exciting stuff.

In other updates:

~ Coinbase stock listing [now has a date… 14th April](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/coinbase-is-said-to-plan-its-direct-listing-in-two-weeks), same day as Berlin! Is Coinbase really worth $90billion? We’ll see!

~ Rocketpool final beta and audits are still ongoing. I think a more realistic mainnet launch date at this stage is late April or possibly even May if they need to react to audit findings.

~ Immutable X announced that Stage 2 of their roadmap has been [delayed slightly](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodsUnchained/comments/mg7hno/timeline_update_on_immutable_x_integration/), but should still land in April. They’re also planning to [integrate with Opensea](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/100084/opensea-nft-layer-2-immutable-x), which is pretty huge. Date unconfirmed as of yet.

walfsdog,"\&gt; MakerDAO took the covid opportunity to steal millions in ETH from its users and blamed a failure in their liquidation mechanism.

Enticing narrative, but this is just wrong.  The markets tanked on BT and Maker's liquidation system ran out of capitalized keepers that could service the auctions in 10 minutes.  The auction system was an English auction system where the price starts low and goes higher.  There were no keepers liquid enough or capable in the block congestion to challenging 1 wei bids in a 10 minute period, and so much of the collateral was lost for 1 wei of DAI.  This caused Vault holders to loose any possibility of getting part of their collateral back, but impacted MKR holders much more, as this lead to massive losses and dilution of MKR.

It seems like you have some narrative that this was an inside job.  This is a common fault most of us make when evaluating a project failure.  While it's tempting to think this way, because everyone sees the motive and opportunity, the reality is that there is often a much more boring and reasonable explanation.

Maker has spent the better part of a year redesigning its liquidation system to NOT be dependent on keeper liquidity, be more resilient to extreme market events, and leverage single block composability and thus all of DeFi in liquidations.  This amount of effort and direction should tell you what really happened to Maker and Vault holders on BT.  Maker and its users are stronger and more informed for it.  This event also proved that debt auctions, where MKR is minted to recapitalize a loss, work.

This is a DAO success story, not a failure.",2021-04-07 06:58:56

Like anything, your rewards have risks. In a liquidity pool you earn fees but have the possibility for impermanent loss. MakerDAO allows you to create Daí from ETH and borrow it for a commission, but you risk liquidation fees. In SNX, if you are a minter, you have the risk of having to inject more money, but you earn fees from synthetic purchases and swaps and also get rewarded extra SNX. Also you coleteral (SNX) can always increase in value, which would help cover a possible market debt increase, although the contrary is also possible. It is all about risk/reward management",2021-04-08 07:09:02
zucchini_fries,"There are few main dollar pegged stablecoins out there, each with different levels of decentralization and risk. 

Tether (USDT): Largest by marketcap, each Tether is supposed to be backed by a dollar in cash reserves. There has been controversy surrounding Tether throughout the years as there has not been fully independent audits on reserves. Recently the price has maintained its $1 peg but previously has dropped 10-20% from speculations.  


USD Coin(USDC): USDC was helped created by Coinbase and each coin is backed by mixture of cash and short term U.S Treasuries. USDC is regulated by financial institutions.  


Dai: Generated by depositing cryptos as collateral into MakerDao protocol smartcontracts/vaults. 

Dai is the most decentralized dollar pegged coin out there as it has the most verifiable collateral/assets. Personally I use Dai I believe it has the lowest risk but the FUD behind Tether is generally overstated.",2021-04-08 07:30:50

argbarman2,"&gt;ETH was effectively a BTC clone

100% wrong and totally evident from the whitepaper. 

&gt; with no real use case until probably mid-2018 when you started seeing dapps finally roll out. 

MakerDAO? Original DAO? Augur ICO? Plenty of use cases. I think you mean no real *adoption* until later, which is fair. But buying Ethereum pre-2017 was a speculative bet on what the tech could do in the future, not what was live already. 

&gt;It was shitcoin territory for a very long time. It wasn't really a matter of having faith in the protocol in those days, because there was no credible use case to point to.

By the beginning of 2017, ETH had very clearly distinguished itself from canonical shitcoins like XRP, LTC, XEM, FCT, etc. Definitely safe to say it was in its own class, not as high as BTC but head and shoulders above the rest. 

&gt;The people who bought back then (including me, until I dumped it all in late 2017/early 2018) were just hoping for pump and dumps.

From the perspective of Maker Governance it was resolved when community members put a [plan](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/vault-compensation-plan-v2/3584) together, it was voted on, and it failed to gain the required support to executed. Instead the majority voted that no compensation should be given. 

The reasons for it's failure are open to debate but personally I believe it was a combination of these:  
1. Responsibility for the issue was not clear-cut (see my previous link.)

2. The class action lawsuit was initiated almost immediately.

3. MKR Holders were already diluted once due to the bad debt in the Maker Protocol that resulted from the issue.",2021-04-09 03:55:20

**I see it at between $700 million and $1 Billion market cap within say 2 years if they manage to pull off even part of what they're planning.** This is also assuming that the US government doesn't introduce some atrocious new laws before then, that kills the crypto space.🙄

Just look at MakerDAO for a comparison in terms of market cap.

However, as others have pointed out, it's important to understand that the small market cap today isn't the ***""Fully Diluted Marketcap""*** so over the coming years, (9 years in total I believe) they will release more tokens. 

This will obviously dilute the value of each token to an extent, but since that happens relatively slowly I don't see it as an issue price wise.

teh4rch3r,"What are your thoughts when someone doesn't pay their mortgage and gets their house foreclosed?  Should the bank just give them a refund or return the house?  

Even in the case where your friend had a cdp of 4000ETH, in order to be liquidated they had to have already taken out a loan of at least 2000ETH of DAI (probably much more)!!!  Since they didn't make payments to keep it above the collateral minimum, MKR was forced not just to liquidate, but also mint MKR and sell it to cover the costs.  In traditional finance the exact same thing happens with houses all the time when houses are liquidated (for potentially far under their actual value) in order to cover debt.

Obviously what happened was not an ideal situation for anyone (minting MKR is a last resort), but I'd say MakerDAO has taken the entire situation extremely seriously.

&gt; While the largest stablecoins in the market are currently controlled and issued by centralized entities like Tether or Circle, DAI and its issuer Maker is one stablecoin project that keeps with the ethos of decentralization that the cryptocurrency community is founded on. Due to this mechanism, the rising supply of DAI has coincided with a surge in the total value locked in the Maker protocol which has made the project the second-ranked DeFi protocol behind Compound which has a $9.28 billion TV. As the TVL on MakerDAO steadily climbed alongside the rising supply of DAI, fundamental indicators including increases in social media activity began signalling an approaching price move. As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for MKR climbed into the green on April 12 and reached a high of 80 on April 13, around 31 hours before the price rallied 65%. With altcoins now on the move again and the DeFi sector heating up as evidenced by rising TVL across the ecosystem, MakerDAO could rally further as it is the go-to choice for investors looking to interact with Ethereum network-based DeFi protocols.

In case you're looking to leverage long ETH, check that ""Leveraged"" box and see what you can set up. If you just need the Dai, leave it off.

Central banks can further adjust the increase or a decrease of the whole supply with interest rates (higher interest will force people to pay back sooner and lower interest to pay it back later) or with quantative easing by buying assets (mostly government bonds) from the banks with new money, but most of the expansion of thw money supply is done by private banks when rates are low.  MakerDAO and Venus work bit similarily but instead of uncollateraled or under collateraled loan given by tradfi, you provide over collateralized amount of crypto for DAI or VAI which is minted when you loan it and burned when you pay it back.  These services have expanded the value of crypto market too.",2021-04-17 06:06:01

TheReasonabilists,"What do you mean? 'anything behind'? 

MakerDAO controls the ceiling and the borrow/savings rates (afaik). Rates are adjusted to market conditions to keep DAI at the peg long term. Apparently the ceiling can be upped now because the system has matured enough and demand for DAI is high. 

They can incentivize paying back DAI by upping the rates. But apparently that is not needed now.

bwjxjelsbd,"&gt;	ive always wondered why have an oracle based protocol. my guess is that it alot of the code around setting up oracles and having it secure, reliable and tamper proof from malicious actors is taken care of. is there more?

I think decentralized oracle is pretty genius ideas. Crypto industry as a whole is based on doing things in trust less mannner. While having one “official” source of data is much cheaper and easier to do, they don’t have the same security as decentralized way. I guess that’s why cryptocurrency use Oracle instead of just pulling APIs from the source. 

&gt;	The alternative of using smartcontracts on eth like chainlink is to just implement oracles on chain per protocol on eth e.g. makerDaO. Correct me if im wrong but i think marketdao does this with its price feeds for USD and eth.

Yeah, project can do this task on their own too might it’s wasting their resources imo. For example you can grown your own vegetables and raised your own cow if you have farm but that does waste a lot of your time and energy. 

&gt;	Do you know if they are going to opt for a parachain slot? or just a parathread?

I don’t see any official source on this. I feels like can just become dapps on Moonbeam if they want to move to Polkadot. My guess is they might be moving IF ETH can’t satisfied them anymore.",2021-04-17 13:43:58

Coldsnap,"Hello Eth-fam. This is the weekly ETHosphere timeline update. Several items checked off of the list made it a pretty significant week. Crypto gained more mainstream acceptance with the Coinbase listing, and the Ethereum blockchain continues its successful run of upgrades since the beacon chain went live last year.

Alternately it could all be nothing... /s

**Protocol updates first:**

~ The Berlin Ethereum protocol upgrade this week was successful! One client, Open Ethereum, experienced a [syncing issue](https://twitter.com/etherscan/status/1382662485832994816?s=20), but this was [quickly fixed](https://github.com/openethereum/openethereum/pull/364). Well done to the Eth1 clients teams for a successful release.

~ All eyes then turn to the next Eth1 upgrade - London, featuring EIP-1559. Development progress is going well with several clients already [successfully syncing](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/client-integration-testnets/aleut.md) to the Aleut devnet. The focus for the next couple of weeks will be the JSON RPC. There is quite a bit of appetite in the teams to get the date for London firmed up. This date was the subject of intense debate on this week’s [All Core Devs call](https://youtu.be/-H8UpqarZ1Y); it is not yet decided which EIPs will be included with London although we know that the difficulty bomb delay alongside [EIP-3198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198), BASEFEE opcode, have made the cut. 3403, 3074, 2537, and 2677 are still being debated. If many more are included it’s likely the date for London will [shift to August](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/245#issuecomment-821329468). This would both give more breathing room to test the changes but also help out The Merge by reducing the number of EIPs that need to be considered in the same breath. Alternately, if there is a need, an upgrade fork could occur in between London and The Merge, but I think this unlikely given how badly people want The Merge to happen ASAP. Basically, it comes down to what MUST be delivered this year vs what can wait 1 year+ for delivery.

~ The Merge testnet will be progressing further at the Rayonism hackathon this week.

**In other timeline updates:**

~ Coinbase IPO happened! Eth2 staking also [went live!](https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-2-0-begins-on-coinbase-canada-approves-3-eth-etfs/) 

~ Rocketpool audits are still ongoing. We are expecting the results of these any day now. In the meantime, the long-awaited [tokenomics article](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-3-3029afb57d4c) finally dropped. Hoping we get some clarity on a mainnet date this week.

**Scaling updates:** 

~ Optimism are also participating in the Ethereum hackathon @ ETHglobal. There is a testnet available for that, which to my mind satisfies the ‘late April’ public testnet milestone in the timeline. 

~ A MakerDAO community call [happened on Tuesday](https://youtu.be/HqALpS93S6k) which focussed on scaling with L2. One of the segments was on the Optimism/DAI bridge and this appears still to be on track - in the timeline for April still in its first stage.

~ ZkSync added some more detail on their plan for ZkSync v2, scheduled to land this summer - this is already in the timeline for August as an estimate. [They posted this week on their novel ZkPorter solution](https://medium.com/matter-labs/zkporter-a-breakthrough-in-l2-scaling-ed5e48842fbf) which, in their view, is a much stronger proposition from a scaling/security perspective than Zk Rollups. Vitalik thinks this criticism is [overblown](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mq2lxd/zkporter_a_breakthrough_in_l2_scaling_matter_labs/gudvo5c/) - some good discussion there.

~ And lastly, now that NFT scaling solution Immutable X has comenced its rollout, they’ve posted an [enticing-looking roadmap](https://www.immutable.com/blog/immutable-x-alpha-trading-launch) that details their plan for wider rollout beyond just Gods Unchained. Unfortunately no dates, but I’ll post them here when known.

snoo_soulo,"Yes, a stablecoin means 1 stable coin is 1$. This needs to be guaranteed, for the price not to change. The classic way to do that is, start a coin and say 'whoever wants to trade this coin with me for 1 dollar can do that, whenever and however much you want'. 


This way if A wants to sell it, the Max price is 1$, because no one will pay more since they can always buy the coin for 1$ from me.  At the other side if B wants to buy it the price can never be below a dollar, because no one is gonna sell it that cheap, since they can sell to me for a dollar. Now if it were to ever happen that I cannot buy or sell for a dollar, the peg is lost. As soon as that happens, trust is lost and the coin goes to $0.

En 2020 creció esa modalidad, generalmente usando [stablecoins](https://www.clarin.com/servicios/stablecoins-dolares-digitales-cepo-limites-compran-argentina_0_cjuPx7Viq.html)"", indicó a **Clarín** Lucas Marincovich, especialista en Criptomonedas de esa fintech.
&gt; 
&gt; ¿Cómo se hace? Tras registrarse y activar la cuenta, explicaron, se genera una **dirección única** que opera como un CBU, pero para recibir los stablecoins. Ese es el código que se le debe enviar al cliente del exterior para que dirija allí su pago en criptomoneda.
&gt; 
&gt; [Sesocio permite recibir criptomonedas y cambiarlas por pesos o dólares a valor de mercado. Foto Captura](https://images.clarin.com/collections/static/lazy_square.svg)Sesocio permite recibir criptomonedas y cambiarlas por pesos o dólares a valor de mercado. Foto Captura
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Una vez que el _freelancer_ recibe en su cuenta de SeSocio ese pago, ya puede vender esas criptomonedas en la plataforma para obtener pesos a un tipo de cambio ""cercano al valor del dólar **contado con liquidación** del mercado local"", dijeron. Este viernes pagaban **$ 150 por cada ""dólar digital""**.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Las criptos también se pueden **vender en dólares** o usarlas para invertir en proyectos dentro de la plataforma"", sumó Marincovich. Los pesos o los dólares obtenidos, aclararon, se pueden retirar en cualquier momento a una cuenta bancaria tradicional.
&gt; 
&gt; **La operatoria en Satoshitango**
&gt; 
&gt; Muchos _freelancers_ argentinos también utilizan **Satoshitango** para recibir pagos en cualquiera de las criptomonedas que admite esa plataforma (Bitcoin, Ethereum, **DAI, USDC**, Ripple, Litecoin y Bitcoin Cash) y luego convertirlas a moneda local.
&gt; 
&gt; ""En el último año estas operaciones **crecieron un 800%** en la Argentina respecto al año anterior"", reveló a **Clarín** Matias Bari, CEO y cofundador de la plataforma.
&gt; 
&gt; En este caso, el profesional debe estar registrado en [www.satoshitango.com](https://www.satoshitango.com) y facilitarle su dirección única a quien le transfiere las criptomonedas, que también **deberá ser usuario** del sitio. ""La transferencia es **sin costo** y se realiza de inmediato"", aseguró Bari.
&gt; 
&gt; Este viernes, en la plataforma, pagaban algo más de **$ 153 por 1 DAI o 1 USDC**, las criptomonedas estables que siempre valen prácticamente lo mismo que **US$ 1**.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ## ¿Qué pasa si el cliente del exterior no quiere pagar en criptomonedas?
&gt; 
&gt; En los países donde más se suele demandar el trabajo de los **freelancers** argentinos, como Estados Unidos y muchos de Europa, usar dólares y euros para comprar criptomonedas es legal y se ha vuelto común.
&gt; 
&gt; Tanto que muchas empresas hoy ofrecen abonar en criptomonedas los trabajos que tercerizan en _freelancers_ de todo el mundo.
&gt; 
&gt; Lo hacen para **reducir costos** y para **facilitar el cobro** en países con duras restricciones cambiarias, como Argentina y Venezuela.
&gt; 
&gt; De todos modos, ante un empleador que sólo ofrece pagar en dólar, euro o similares, lo que hacen algunos _freelancers_ hacen es:
&gt; 
&gt; - Abrir en el extranjero una cuenta bancaria o una billetera virtual (como Paypal) y recibir allí los honorarios en dólares.
&gt; - Convertir los dólares a una criptomoneda estable en una ""casa de cambio digital"" de ese mismo país, como puede ser [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/es) en Estados Unidos.
&gt; - Vender los criptoactivos en la Argentina por pesos o dólares en una plataforma P2P o una ""casa de cambio"" digital local.
&gt; 
&gt; El problema de esta opción es que, según especialistas, puede traer **problemas legales**.
&gt; 
&gt; [Los que trabajan desde Argentina para el exterior buscan alternativas para que sus ingresos les rindan más.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ## La legalidad de la maniobra y su aspecto impositivo
&gt; 
&gt; Ahora bien, ¿cómo es la convivencia entre este creciente fenómeno y las leyes argentinas respecto de cómo debería realizarse un cobro a un cliente del exterior?
&gt; 
&gt; José Luis Ceteri, especialista en temas tributarios, explicó a **Clarín** que la normativa de referencia es la que regula las **exportaciones de servicios**. ""Ya sean monotributistas o estén en el régimen general, los _freelancers_ tienen que hacer una **factura E** -de exportación- al cobrar sus ventas"", detalló.
&gt; 
&gt; Y amplió: ""Ese ingreso está exento de IVA y de Ingresos Brutos. Pero las divisas obtenidas **deben liquidarse** (venderse por pesos). Y deben pagar un **5% de retención**, salvo que el contribuyente esté registrado en la AFIP como micro o pequeña empresa, y siempre que no haya exportado más de US$ 600 mil el año anterior"".
&gt; 
&gt; Según Florencia Fernández Sabella, especialista en Tributación, hoy lo problemático de todo esto es que los dólares ganados en el exterior deben rápidamente ""liquidarse en pesos en Argentina a través del Mercado Único y Libre de Cambios (MULC), al tipo de **cambio oficial**"". Es decir, a menos de **$ 93** por dólar.
&gt; 
&gt; Ahora bien, ¿qué pasa si lo que se cobró afuera no fueron estrictamente dólares, sino **criptomonedas que equivalen** a dólares? Ahí las cosas ya no son tan claras porque la legislación no fue hecha previendo algo así.

The cool thing is that it’s not a coin that promises something later, it’s doing what it’s supposed to do now. You can get a loan of Dai on certain cryptocurrencies right now, and then get cash for your Dai. You can also buy Dai, which is what it creates, and it’s historically done a good job of staying pegged to the dollar. Assuming that crypto continues to become more popular, people will resist selling for a taxable transaction and take out a loan. That is done through the MakerDao smart contract with a vault. Anyway, really cool and with MKR, you can be part of the governance of it. It’s riskier than BTC or ETH, but I like it.",2021-04-22 02:58:06

FidelHimself,"I'm glad you asked because this is my favorite subject. Pretty complex in details but the big picture is simple. 

This summer a bunch of Web3 orgs were created known as Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). For example, MakerDAO which take ETH (cryptocurrency) as collateral and issues loans in digital dollars (DAI) which keep the value of $1. This is money that can be invested or even used to buy a home, while the underlying asset (ETH) does not need to be sold. 

The DAO is permissionless so even a 12 year old could use it if they knew how. The DAO is run by those who own a stake but there is no location for the organization; it is native to the internet. When people interact with the Maker protocol but it is non-custodial which means the ""customer"" keeps custody of his tokens, there are only smart contracts and no human middle-men. The code is open-source and can be audited for bugs or exploits -- compare that with traditional government bodies.

I can go on about the benefits of this model but these are the key points. There are many other DAOs with their own goals and communities. They can be the governing body of a virtual world, an NFT art trading platform, or a gambling site.

In the physical world we have volunteer local governance models like Homeowner's Associations that take fees to act collectively. They mow community land, maintain fences and other basics like fountains or small parks. Sometimes they collectively pay for security. 

**I'm proposing we combine HOAs and DAOs to replace current coercive governments, one department at a time.** 

We don't need politicians to act as middle men anymore. 

**We can decentralize every service and let different models compete withing the same geographical area.** Think about how much conflict would be solved if we didn't all have to live under the same federal structure. You could theoretically live next to a socialist and a capitalist without them imposing their preferred system on the other by coercive measures.

One final point is that this is not ""all or nothing"". Everyone would have to agree that we respect the natural rights of those not affiliate with our community. Beyond that, every single policy could be it's own contract. 

The entire constitution could be one contract with many subcontracts. The difference is that every citizens would explicitly sign these contracts instead of just some old guys (supposedly) back int he 18th century.",2021-04-23 06:07:24

&gt; Now MakerDAO is paving the way for what might become another source of growth in the now-$60 billion DeFi industry: lending against trillions of dollars of real world assets including residential properties, in competition with banks and other financiers. The MKR token's price surged above $4,000 on Wednesday for the first time as members of the MakerDAO community - the decentralized organization that governs the project - passed an executive vote to allow an ERC-20 token representing an ownership stake in a pool of real estate assets as collateral.

I guess the main takeway is to realize how cyclical these markets can be (Because of Bitcoin halvening). But if ETH manages to decouple from Bitcoin at some point, the game will change :)

CrushHazard,"People think of Bitcoin when they think of crypto, but it’s much more than that. 

The Stellar network is being heavily used to make cross border payments and currency conversions. 

Orchid is a decentralized VPN. 

Augur uses its token to power prediction networks. 

But the most exciting stuff going on is in DeFi platforms like MakerDAO. It uses a currency called DAI, which is pegged to the value of a dollar. Essentially, your financial transaction (which could be just about anything — a house purchase, a bond issuance, a crowdfunded secured loan....) is reviewed, monitored and verified by hundreds of real life users called Oracles instead of a centralized entity like a bank. You always pay market price for your transaction instead of dealing with the banking oligopoly. 

There is so much efficiency that can be gained by circumventing traditional finance, which has truly become a scam lately. Think about it. In the old days, the bank paid you to hold your money. Now, you pay them. And they will tell you that it’s all about security, but how secure have these entities been? What are you really paying for? Something of value, or just the fact that you have nowhere else to go, thanks to regulatory capture?

You provide ETH as collateral and can then drawdown DAI. These loans are over collateralised (150%), meaning you can borrow up to 66% of the value of your ETH. This means that the borrower can never default, as in the event the ETH price falls, the ETH that is held as collateral will be sold. 

You can draw and repay DAI at any given point, there is no repayment schedule (but you will need to consider your collateralisation ratio and may have to repay to maintain this).

Burning off MKR counteracts the minting of new MKR being created and reduces the supply thus increasing MKR’s value for token holders.""

T2000-TT,"For people who don't know what atomic composability is, it is the ability to instantly commit a transaction across multiple shards at the same time in a single step. This is in contrast to non-atomic composability where a transaction goes through on one shard first and then other shards later or cross shard transactions take multiple blocks to process. Non atomic composability is really inefficient and completely breaks a lot of apps, things like flash loans and apps like yearn and MakerDAO stop working properly across shards without atomic composability and even apps like Uniswap can experience problems.
By providing atomic composability and Unlimited scalability Radix is the only project that will be able to scale DeFi indefinitely into the future without issues.


Radix makes dapp building much easier too, dapps are built out of FSM components which are more secure than solidity smart contracts, easier to build and easier to learn for traditional web devs crossing over into the world of decentralised apps. App developers who build useful components on Radix will receive lifetime royalties whenever their component is used, encouraging the growth of the Radix ecosystem and rewarding devs for making valuable contributions.
Right now the project is sitting at a marketcap of 170M, this is nothing for a project that is solving such huge problems and has this level of technology.
If the tech wasn't enough, Radix is about to release their Betanet a week from today and Mainnet in June. It is early now but momentum is building up now and after seeing what recently happened with Solana I don't think it will remain undervalued for much longer.

TLDR
- Unlimited scalability, very fast, cheap fees
- The only platform where apps don't lose performance with sharding
- Easy to build apps on
- Lower risk of smart contract exploits
- Great developer incentive program (lifetime rewards)
- Betanet in 1 week, Mainnet in June

They are still working on their smart contract layer. Their functional UTXO-based smart contracts launch in August.

Then they have to rewrite all of the DeFi contract systems they want in that functional UTXO-based system - if they want clones of things like Uniswap, MakerDAO, etc. they have to re-architect it from the ground up. Then they get to write a new rollup system, again from the ground up because it needs to be written in a functional language for a UTXO-based system.

If they put teams on all of that and it all happens in parallel, you're still looking at 2 years out at LEAST until they have DeFi running on rollups, and that's being very generous. My guess would be closer to 3 years for launch, 4-5 to gather liquidity and reach maturity.

So yes, Cardano can theoretically implement rollups, but I can tell you it won't happen for a long time. This isn't wishy washy fud like ""Ethereum 2.0 will never launch"" either, I believe it would actually take them at least 3 years of real development time, even if they know exactly what kind of system design they are building, to have anything close to Ethereum's DeFi rollups.",2021-04-25 04:56:35

Once smart contracts go live, devs will have to re-write DeFi, products like MakerDAO, Uniswap, etc. under a functional software paradigm for a UTXO system, no copying code because the architectures are so different and Cardano handles contract shared state in a completely different way.

Once smart contracts are launched, Cardano starts where Ethereum was in 2016, newly supporting smart contract token systems and starting to build DeFi from the ground up on layer 1. Meanwhile, ethereum will have launched rollups and scaled on an evm-compatible layer 2.

If anything the number of positions that was automated at that moment kept the overall Maker protocol from going into much more negative debt. There was about 7,5m Dai of debt paid back by the system on behalf of users on Black Thursday and that was at a moment where there was 100-150m Dai in total, so quite a noticeable amount.

Either way, I wish they did figure out a reimbursment plan of any kind for everyone affected by 0 bids on that day, but unfortunately it never came to be.",2021-04-25 18:12:29

Our Automation services are also trustless with all user parameters and permissions being fully on-chain, with the off-chain elements being our DFS bots that track positions and send out the needed transactions.

nikola_j,"Boost and Repay are leverage management actions, where Boost borrows more to buy more of the target asset and increase your exposure, and Repay takes out and sells part of the collateral to reduce exposure and risk (or you can do a full Repay if you're set to close a leveraged position fully).

These can be used manually whenever wanted, Boost and Repay are available in all our dashboards (for Maker, Compound, Aave1+2 and Reflexer) and you can chose to run either of those at any point you want.

And then Automation is an add-on service where you can configure auto-Boosting and auto-Repaying based on wanted parameters.

There are two ways you could use Automation - either for liquidation protection or for automated leverage management.

In case of auto-leverage management, you can use this tool to simulate what would happen over certain simulated periods - [https://defiexplore.com/simulation](https://defiexplore.com/simulation)

The Automation system is pretty basic right now, and it can either increase leverage when market goes in your position's direction, or decrease when it goes the opposite. For example, if you create a leveraged CDP at MakerDAO in April 2020 and had it automated, it would have been buying up more ETH as it kept going up, which would overall result in you having a noticeably higher ETH balance to potentially close to today.

Thought, you could both long or short assets at DeFi Saver, so you could also automated a short position (though those are only doable in Compound and Aave, not in Maker). If needed, [here's a post](https://medium.com/defi-saver/how-to-long-or-short-any-asset-using-defi-lending-protocols-812300c9a640) on longing and shorting assets using DeFi lending protocols.",2021-04-25 18:42:25

While these are currently only available for manual usage and don't have that many protocols supported, this is something that we just released and that we aim to greatly expand on in the next months and, really, throughout this whole year.

And then we also have plans to add automation support, where you could for example configure an automatic action ""if the c-ratio of my vault #3421 falls below 180%, withdraw Dai from Yearn and pay back vault debt"". 

Also:

&gt;I'm aware of defisaver and it's great but it only works with stables in your wallet, not in a farm. 

This isn't really how currently available Automation for MakerDAO at DeFi Saver works - it never uses Dai from your account. It actually unwinds part of your position to pay off debt, meaning that it takes as much ETH (or whichever collateralized asset) needed to sell for Dai for debt payback to reach your set target ratio.

slicxx,"You are right and wrong.
The aUSD will be the stable coin in the Acala Network.
Acala itself is so much more - Automated Marked Maker (AMM), a full Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and will provide a lot of DeFi utility with the Acala EVM alone.
The Acala Token (ACA) will be some sort of governance/utility token which i would compare to MakerDAO for beginners to better understand, although they are for sure not the same.

There is a lot to learn about the project, here is a good [link explaining the ecosystem without getting too complicated](https://academy.ivanontech.com/blog/what-is-acala-and-the-aca-token)

You should also read about Karura - its basically the same on the Kusama network.
Since Kusama has a lower trust level and will be also faster - Karura (KAR is the token token) i would explain it as Acala on Steroids, lets see how that works out!

I'm going to patricipate in the candle auctions on Karura because I personally believe in it big times. Sadly, aggregating KSM for the auctions seems to be a little bit expensive 😅",2021-04-27 02:16:03
stoopslife,"I'm not really sure how it would be similar to MakerDAO at all? The point of MakerDAO is to provide a token DAI that can be used for borrowing/lending with less risk because the price is stable. That allows for lower borrowing rates when priced in DAI.

This HODL idea is more like ""I have these tokens in DeFi, but I've pledged them to this lender to be paid back over time"".

It would basically be a collateralized loan where you make profit on the underlying. You could initiate the contract with a lender address who is allowed to withdraw a certain amount every month. And the rest of the underlying continues to make DeFi interest. The lender could even withdraw lazily and collect some of that DeFi interest when the underlying principal is ""paid"" to them.",2021-04-27 02:41:40

Connortbh,"I’ve heard anchor protocol is 20% APR but I’ve not used it myself. Depending on your risk tolerance you might consider using Liquity. It’s like MakerDAO but with a better design, just came out a couple weeks ago. You can lock ETH and draw out LUSD with a collateral as low as 110% (wouldn’t recommend lower than 200% though). Put the LUSD in the stability pool and you earn 45% APR in the form of LQTY tokens. Risk is in the event of a mass liquidation event you’re agreeing to buy ETH at about a 10% discount from the spot price. If it’s a very large crash you might be caught “holding the bag” in the event that ETH continues to fall before you can sell it. https://www.liquity.org/",2021-04-27 04:35:58

albasili,"&gt;Optimism is what most Ethereum projects are betting on. 

I would reconsider this statement given that as of today we have AAVE, Curve, Sushiswap, Quickswap (a fork of Uniswap) and other protocols rapidly embracing Polygon. The farming incentives put in place are working pretty well and TVL is increasing by the day.

Additionally Optimism and Polygon are composable, so I'm not entirely sure we will see a race there, rather a multiplier effect. Once Optimism is released we will see more and more integration as the major protocols are supporting those solutions. MakerDao has announced [Optimism Dai Bridge](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/announcing-the-optimism-dai-bridge-with-fast-withdrawals/6938), sometime ago, but I doubt they want to miss on the opportunities on Polygon.",2021-04-27 22:31:26

Jayeluu1129,"/u/longforwisdom has  the correct answer. The DAI price could spike if there was a mass selloff of Ether or something, in which case demand for DAI would increase in the short term as people try to cover their positions. But DAI spiking wouldn't put you at risk of being liquidated, only a decrease in price of the collateralized asset would.

This happened on Black Thursday in March 2020, I think DAI hit $1.23 at the time. Barring any more black swan events, something like that hopefully won't happen again. 

400% isn't a bad place to start, and glad to hear you have additional Ether to throw in in case of emergency. Yield farming with funds effectively minted from MakerDAO does have risks though, as I'm sure you're aware. Lending rates have generally remained above 10%, depending on the platform, but if MKR governors decide to increase stability fee and/or lending rates start to fall, you obviously risk then losing money. Good to monitor rates! Won't be a big deal if that happens, just keep an eye out.",2021-04-28 02:20:07
epic_trader,"Before you jumped to a conclusion about what you thought this probably meant, you could have looked it up or asked me to elaborate. It's actually incredibly exciting and it's a shame you just dismiss it as a whole because you think it's probably just a lot of empty buzzwords. Please note I didn't say the company was run by AI nor that I'm aware of any that are, what I'm talking about is strictly DAOs which are decentralized autonomous organizations. 

Running a DAO means you've deployed a smart contract (application) to a blockchain with an execution layer like on Ethereum. This application has a number of functions determined by it's programming. Once this application has been deployed, it will live on the blockchain forever, and at any point you can contract a function from the application if you follow its rules. 

The management of this application happens via voting on proposals by MakerDAO token holders. In this specific example the company still has an official CEO, CTO, COO, developers, etc. The crucial difference is that control of the company is in the hands of the shareholders. The shareholders, who are holders the MKR token (like a digital stock with voting rights) can be anonymous and spread all across the globe, but they are the ones who decide which proposals pass and which do not. Anyone can make a proposal and put it to a vote, and then the official implementation is managed by the company. 

In the case of MakerDAO their product is a stable currency called DAI, a digital token that follows the value of the USD. Users can mint DAI from the MakerDAO smart contract by making a deposit of some underlying collateral, like ETH or wrapped BTC or real world assets. Basically it's like a decentralized bank that allows you to take out a loan with something you own put up as security. To release your collateral you must pay back the amount of DAI you owe. If your underlying collateral starts losing value to the point where there's a chance your debt position becomes undercollateralized, either you must supply more collateral, or your underlying collateral is auctioned off on the market.

It's not just ""a company that holds no personal, physical resources, while the only resource that it controls is produced on an at-home basis"". I never said it was and you could have looked it up yourself if you actually cared to know.",2021-04-28 03:06:23
ethacct,"yep!  MakerDAO vault -&gt; DAI loan.  Deposit DAI into yield farm (aave, harvest, yearn, etc.) to make more money.  When you're done, collect your yield then take your original DAI back to pay off your MakerDAO debt and return your ETH.  I'm doing this right now, actually.

Things to be aware of:

1. If the price of ETH drops considerably, you will have to pay back your debt sooner (since it is collateral if the price of your collateral falls it may not be enough to cover your outstanding debt)

2. make sure the yield you're farming is higher than the interest you're paying on the Maker loan (currently 5.5% per year but it can change)

3. gas costs are currently expensive on ethereum.  this will change in the future but for right now it's not really profitable to do it with less than 5 figures USD.",2021-04-28 03:32:56

Cpunk-AJ,"DAI is inelastic and collateralized - doesnt change in supply based on market pressure - it depends on the keepers to liquidate or arbitrage different crypto assets that are being traded on makerDao

BadAssPleb,"TLDR: 

The head of Banco Santander's blockchain lab in Madrid, recently touted the potential for increased decentralized ledger technology adoption in mainstream finance.

While acknowledging that current public blockchain networks might not be optimized for high-frequency transactions, Whelan highlighted their suitability for settlements in the financial services arena.

""Settlement is not something that has to happen instantaneously,"" Whelan stated, adding: ""Usually in the financial market, settlement is T+5 - we agree on a trade and we wait five days for settlement.""

Earlier in April, Rune Christensen, CEO of decentralized finance unicorn MakerDAO, stated that DeFi will require regulatory clarity to move from its current isolated bubble phase toward more significant interfacing with mainstream finance.

Whelan also touched on the recent announcement that Banco Santander was one of three financial institutions selected by the European Investment Bank to issue a two-year 100-million-euro ($120 million) digital bond.
According to the bank executive, the legal record of ownership is domiciled entirely on the public Ethereum blockchain.
