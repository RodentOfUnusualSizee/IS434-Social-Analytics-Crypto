ProofChange,"""Not be able to stand out in any way"" sounds like a very generic concern. I liked the fact that my majors are popular here because I made so many friends in and out of classes. A friend of my from my high school of the same major attends another equally-famous college, but there are only 8 people in our major there and she felt very secluded. As for econ, if you are thinking of going into academia there is really no better place to study than here. If your goal is to get a job in finance then there are many other schools who do an equally good job. The majority of econ majors do not have plans for graduate study. 


The workload and being graded on a curve are not the same thing. The workload here might be heavier than some other schools, but definitely not impossibly so. In my opinion, econ is a relatively easy major here. Being graded on a curve - well that's just how it is in every other college and not specific to uchicago. You will be graded on a curve in some classes and the curves help more often than not.",2021-05-01 01:04:34

Chris-Courage,"It will come to an end.  Prices will rise the dollar will fall because they will bypass rising interest rates, at least at first, with yield curve control.  Now you issue more stimulus because stocks went down because a few on the lower tiers of the wealth spectrum were selling stocks to finance tax, energy, food.  But that was why the dollar was declining in the first place so the result is further declining of the dollar which again wants to influence energy, real estate, food prices and the 10 year yield higher causing more yield curve control.  I suppose the yield control part can be contained and fire walled.  

Then you have the foreign bonds being retired and not being rolled over into new issue.  Who is going buy them.  The Fed, directly?  Now they have to monetize old issue and new issue plus UBI?

LastNightOsiris,"whoa there, I'm not ""denouncing"" anything, it's not like this is a church sermon against the evils of payday lending.
I'm just saying that leaving each individual to figure out whether or not to borrow in a laissez-faire system with any arbitrarily punitive loan terms is facile and elides the complexities of the real world situation.

When we regulate price and terms of consumer loans, it does indeed reduce the supply of consumer credit for the borrowers with the worst credit. Some people who want credit will be unable to get it, at least not from a source that is in compliance with laws and regs. However, if we let everyone get as much credit as they want  with whatever terms lenders want to charge, some people will get into big trouble because they don't fully understand what they are doing. 

We don't need to know each individual's situation, utility curve, information set, SAT score, and favorite color. Economics  as a science is mostly based around not needing to know that. We only care about the marginal borrower. What we are saying is something like ""above a 25% APR, an additional dollar lent does damage than good in our economy.""

cip43r,"**What is Matic?**

Matic is the token for the new Polygon Network.

**What is Polygon?**

Polygon is a new L2 scaling solution for not limited to but currently only for Ethereum.

**How does it work (ELI5)?**

The Polygon network also works like Ethereum. It processes transactions and stores it on a blockchain. Currently Ethereum is doing this very slowly using PoW, Polygon does it with PoS, which is faster. It then makes its own blockchain and puts snapshots of this on Ethereum. So Polygon has its own consensus which is faster but then uses the Ethereum consensus less, but still stores everything and make the network secure. On Polygon fess are so low , after 100 transactions, I couldn't see the difference in my balance. Transactions are also near instant. 

**How do I use it?:**

First you need to connect to the network. Polygon interacts with metamask just like Ethereum. So you are going to use your Ethereum address on Polygon. But first you need Metamask to talk to the Polygon Network.

[How to connect Metamask to Polygon Network](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/metamask/config-matic/)

Ok cool. Now change it back to the Ethereum Network. And go to the Polygon bridge. A bridge is a gateway between blockchains. You want to send your ETH, Matic, Linn whatever from Ethereum Network to the Matic Network.

You will need to wait about 10 minutes. Don't worry I also stressed the first time. According to Polygon, the transfer should take about 7-10 minutes. Also, set your ETH gas fee higher than normal to help speed up using the bridge. Once you have completed the ETH transaction, switch your Metamask back to the Polygon Network and wait for the transfer.

Once you have received your funds, go and see what real defi looks like.

MachineTeaching,"No.

Governments which have their own sovereign currency have the *option* to always finance all their debt by additional money creation so they never ""have"" to default.

This much is true and uncontroversial. It's something basic mainstream economics tells us, too. In fact if I remember correctly this came up in the first few weeks in my first semester intro to macro class.

MMT goes much further than that though.

But first of all, let's talk about the problem with that. Yes, you can always print more money and use that to pay off debt, so you never run out of money, technically. The issue is that as you print more money, the value of your currency falls, inflation rises, until that eventually destroys your economy. And yes, that's exactly what happened to plenty of countries in history.

So while you could always pay your debts in theory, that doesn't necessarily matter much in practice. It's not worth to destroy your economy just so you don't have to default, and in practice, countries do default on their debt, it's really not *that* rare.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_debt_crises

Where does MMT stand here? Well, they also recognise that just printing more and more money leads to inflation. But they say that the government can just control inflation via taxes, by removing the money you tax from the economy.

They also say a lot of other relevant things. That the government should establish a job guarantee, which is supposed to serve as a buffer. They say that interest rates should just be ""parked"" at a fixed rate. They also say that [the IS curve is vertical](https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2011/04/reverse-engineering-the-mmt-model.html), which basically translates to monetary policy not only being not necessary (because interest rates should just stay fixed) but *useless*. They also say that government spending should be financed via money creation and that the government *shouldn't finance itself via bonds*.

MMT isn't just saying ""governments can spend a lot"", MMT is a whole bunch of policy prescriptions.

But most importantly, [MMT is pseudoscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/itbu98/comment/g5flqih?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3).",2021-05-03 18:10:01
jtdolla911,"Always a degree of risk. Their strategies rely on smart contracts, so you're money is only as secure as the contracts. That said, they put a lot of research into their strategies and contracts to provide a secure and profitable approach.

crustycalzone,"I must correct you there, MMT does not suggest that taxation is the main tool governments have to control inflation. It does say that taxation is the universal use case for currency, but does not suggest it as a principle tool for controlling inflation.

Scott Fulwiller, a leading MMT proponent and academic, explains that here:

[https://www.ft.com/content/539618f8-b88c-3125-8031-cf46ca197c64](https://www.ft.com/content/539618f8-b88c-3125-8031-cf46ca197c64)

&gt;Second, we do not believe that any and all inflation that does result from excessive demand can and should be addressed by higher taxes. This is a distortion of our view, as years of publications can attest. When MMT says that a major role of taxes is to help offset demand rather than generate revenue, we are recognising that taxes are a critical part of a whole suite of potential demand offsets, which also includes things like tightening financial and credit regulations to reduce bank lending, market finance, speculation and fraud.  Assessing the potential inflationary effect of new spending proposals also requires seriously assessing how underutilised our existing resources are. This requires detailed, expert analysis from a range of industry analysts; not just statistical regressions on aggregate economic data by macroeconomists.

Secondly, just because a theory is untested, does not make it pseudo science. Much of MMT is just a description of accounting principles, or logical assertions without specific quantatative relations.  These logical assertions have yet to be put into robust quantitative models, because that is a challenging task, and it is fair to say that MMT does not have the same amount of intellectual capital and other resources that mainstream has.  There is not a stream of well trained graduate student researchers adept in MMT doing graduate work.  It is still a small group of academics with diverse backgrounds, so it is fair to say that the body of empirical analysis is very underwhelming.

When it comes to money, for the purpose of inflation, mainstream focuses on monetary aggregates, M0, M1, M2, etc. While MMT cares less about liquidity of assets, and more about who issues the assets.  So for example, bank deposits are issued by banks, but currency and treasury bonds are both issued by governments, so MMT typically considers currency and treasury bonds very similarly, for the purpose of inflation analysis.

So for the purposes of analyzing inflation, MMT considers the national debt to be the money supply. This is a stark and very unique claim.  And while it is fair to say it is untested at scale, it is unfair to simply call it pseudoscience.  Just because a theory has not been tested, does not make it pseudo science.

The reason it is untested, is because for the last 30 to 40 years, major developed economies have not had to deal with significant inflation.  After going off the gold standard, due to the nixon shock in 71, there was initially considerable inflation.  But once that was stabilized over the next decade and a half, inflation has been non-existent since, in major developed economies.  MMT inflation analysis applies mostly to countries without a gold standard, and without fixed rate exchange, so there is simply not much good historical information that is applicable.

Prominent economists do not understand MMT, first paul krugman. Noah Smith for years asserted it is ""the fiscal theory of the price level"", when in fact, MMT only says that in certain rare conditions, the FTPL may be accurate.  Many have tried to state MMT is just a vertical curve in an IS-LM model, when MMT considers IS-LM models a poor way to view inflation and economic constraints altogether.",2021-05-03 23:35:52

soggypoopsock,"when you contrast a platform like eth to a company like apple it’s always going to puzzle you when trying to assess value but the mechanisms of price discovery and justification are entirely different

Imagine if TCP/IP had a way to generate value per packet? That would have been the biggest asset class in history. But instead the only value we have is on the application layer.

Cute_Meringue1331,"NUS BBA graduate here. Seriously did not enjoy my time in NUS. Yeah like if your fantasy is going to supper, gymming in Town, then you will be in for a rude shock. My NUS BBA junior with 2nd upper can't find a job since 2019.

1. The bell curve at NUS is very steep. The poly people who came in are the cream of the crop, they have internship experience. The JC graduates are very competitive. As an unpopular introvert, I didn't get much chance to class participate and my CAP is shit. However, my junior has decent CAP that didn't help him in getting a job either lol.
2. NUS Career Services is lousy. They don't really do much to help students improve their CV, or bring in good internships to the students. For example, my ex-Company Prudential don't even hold a booth in the career fair here, they focus on NTU and SMU (not the Insurance Agent, but the corporate side).
3. Internships are not compulsory. However, many students self-source internships (cough connections). It's common for the really competitive people to do 5-7 internships. They want to get into investment banking.
4. Weak specialisations in NUS. NUS used to only have 4 boring specialisations: Finance (for aspiring bankers), Marketing (people who want to get into FMCG like Unilever, P&amp;G), Management and Operations (most unpopular ones). Now, they got 3 more: Entrepreneurship (so useless, I mean isn't it ironic, you go to school to learn to be an entrepreneur when you can just start your own business), Business Analytics (very popular), Business Economics (redundant bc there is already an Economics minor available to BBA students).
5. Career after uni. What do you want to do? A lot of people who don't do well, end up just doing some $3k job in insurance (like me lol). The reason is because business has the largest cohort in Singapore, unlike Law, where only SMU and NUS have. NTU BBA+SMU BBM+SIM Business+overseas schools+other degrees because apparently, BBA degree is not a prerequisite.

TLDR: if you're extrovert and popular (cough good-looking cough), you can do well in either. But if you're just a normal person, then you will not stand out in NUS BBA.",2021-05-04 10:17:08

cmiovino,"College is a shame. You spend 4 years after high school, arguably when you're in the best shape to actually learn something and all you do is take the same classes from high school over again in your first 1-2 years. Sprinkle in some 'humanities' and other useless crap. Finally for a year or two you take more specialized classes for your major, but when you get on the job, nothing it done the way you learn it. You don't learn any practical skills.

The main issue is you waste four years paying huge tuition just to regurgitate a professor's views or terms written in some textbook, ironically written by another professor. It's in one ear and out the other. You don't ""learn"" much as you don't use it.

Hell, I did 5 years when you factor in my masters degree and came out, hit my first job, and totally sucked at it. Nothing made sense. Nothing was really applicable. I had to completely learn accounting and finance the way that company did it. School didn't teach me Excel and pivot tables or the formulas I needed. It didn't teach me email and business etiquette. It didn't teach me skills to think outside the box when my boss asked me to figure a problem out or fix something. My entire first year was a huge learning curve.

Stellar_Cartographer,"I agree with most of this. I wouldn't call it light on theory, but light on novel theory, with examples being; a near vertical IS curve based on the stance that Investment is highly inelastic to interest rates, the replacement of the NAIRU with the [NAIBER](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIBER), and the theory behind the history of money. 

I think overly focusing on the differences in theory is place of the differences in policy recommendation is a little missleading though (in general not towards you). There are very large policies which could have large effects on the economy which are supported by MMT and not more standard New Keynesian economists (here I am refering mainly to [Automatic Stabilizers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/automaticstabilizer.asp#:~:text=Automatic%20stabilizers%20are%20ongoing%20government,spending%20over%20the%20business%20cycle.) such as an employment guarantee or using taxes to control demand, not things that advocates of MMT support, like a Green new deal). 

&gt;the primary reason is the observation that the Fed has doing massive QE without creating inflation, so the thinking goes maybe it can keep on doing it and maybe directly finance government programmes instead of buying bonds in secondary market operations.

My bf has an economics degree and our family friend is a hobbyist. The family friend is an Ivy League educated retired surgeon with a business degree (long story). His brother worked in finance (also retired). This family friend is extremely intelligent and reads constantly, but he doesn’t have any structure in how he approaches texts. So everything weighs evenly and can’t discern quality at all. If anything, he gravitates to punchy opinion articles from the heritage foundation or hillsdale college  with less academic verbiage almost always written by non-economists. He can’t explain basic things freshman would know like Keynesianism, the Laffer Curve, or even fiscal vs monetary policy.

Underfitted,"&gt;On Facebook:  ""Some analysts expressed concern over Facebook's revenue model; namely, its advertising practices.

It's also the first  profitable tech IPO in decades.  Amazon traded under it's IPO price  shortly after hitting the market.  Did that seem to be indicative of  it's future success?  Didnt we end up seeing hundreds of tech IPO's hit  the market in the years after?  There's a bunch of similarities between  the dot com boom and where were currently at with crypto.

&gt;You must not pay attention.  Apple has been working on integration with  Apple Pay and their Apple Card and has already pushed apo kits for  developers.  Google is developing their own cryptocurrency.  Amazon has a  project that appears to be a payment product targeted for release in  Mexico and has been hiring people and buying domains for the last few  years.  Microsoft is working on a Digital Identification system that  runs on Bitcoin.  Facebooks Libra is now called Diem and its still being  worked on.  JP Morgan built an entire department and hired engineers.   TD Bank has also added a crypto department and staffed up.  Visa and MC  announced support for crypto by the end of the year.  Look around,  theres more and more evidence of adoption.  Financial institutions are  doing the biggest hiring in crypto right now and some of them are  gobbling up crypto startups.

Amazon is digital currency

Apple has made no such announcement, you are once again drinking the crypto kool aid by crypto sites. 

Google has made no such announcement

MS is doing a pet project, not a major product

Yes, JP Morgan did the same in 2017. Hint finance companies like to make easy money. 

Visa and MC are still using their own payment processing, they aren't using the blockchain for transactions, and settlement is still going to be in dollars. They'll just act like a broker and change crypto to cash at convenient times with nice spreads so they can profit of the people like you. 

Facebook's Diem is dollar pegged, so much for crypto replacing fiat.

Also LMAO at butters celebrating centralisation when crypto was meant to be about decentralisation.

Wright was an engineer back in the 1930s who noticed that for every doubling of cumulative production there was a learning curve reduction in the cost.  Applying Wright's Law to the price of an ICE vehicle starting with the Ford Model T accurately predicted the price of Fords for the next 109 years.

Because BEVs are so new, cumulative doubling of production occurs fairly rapidly.  One million vehicles is doubled to two million vehicles in maybe the next year, two doubles to four in a bit more time, four doubles to eight some what slower, etc.  For ICE vehicles, a billion vehicles may have been built, so doubling to two billion will take 10 years at 100 million ICE sales a year.  Thus, at some point BEVs will be cheaper to build than ICE vehicles.  The decrease in cost has been estimated at 18% for each doubling in cumulative production, I think by BNEF (Bloomberg New Energy Finance).",2021-05-06 15:25:57

Cheek_Klapper525,"**Area 51 | NEW | Fair Launch | Soon to Release!**

 The Area51 Token (A51) is a multi-function token deployed on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It has been designed with the community at the forefront of its code and will embody everything a true decentralised token should stand for…   With some added perks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Token Symbol**: Area51 (A51)

**Decimal**: 18

**Total Supply**: Max 51,000,000,000

**Token Address**: TBA

**Auto-Burn**: Yes 🔥  🔥  🔥 

**Auto-Fee Distribution**: Yes in A51 per transaction to hodlers

**Auto-Liquidity Provision**: Yes, 2% direct to PancakeSwap per transaction

**Perks**:

**Deflationary** : 10 % of all transactions carried out (Buy or Sell) will be burned from the total supply of A51. This will ensure that A51 continues to become more scarce in its supply as each buy or sell is carried out via PancakeSwap. This will ensure a price floor and a value increase as demand moons past the supply of A51 at a given price point

And yes.. our burns will be **Automatic, no need to rely on devs to manually burn tokens or trust a third party. Our token has an automatic burn hard coded into the contract.**

**Reward Distribution** : Of the 10 % total burn, 50% of this amount will be re-distributed to A51 hodlers… So yes… By holding your A51 you will automatically receive more A51 tokens in your wallet every time a transaction is carried out

The other 50% will be burned from the total supply (51,000,000,000) meaning that at some point we may run out of A51… or will we…

**Staking :** We have developed our very own staking DAPP that will be live after the public sale and listing of the A51 token on PancakeSwap.

The Staking Platform will be easy to use and navigate with an optimised and sleek UI. You can simply Stake your tokens in the DAPP and earn direct rewards in more A51 tokens dependant on the current staking APY…

(We will set this at **1300 %** at Genesis Launch Day)

The great thing about staking in comparison to Liquidity Mining i.e. supplying A51-BNB, or A51-BUSD is that you will not be effected by Impairment Losses due to volatile movements in A51 token price.

**Automatic Liquidity Pool (LP)**

This is one of they key factors that make A51 unique. This multi-fold action provides a heavy use-case and protection for all of our community at Area51. We have developed our token contract to collect a small portion (2%) of every buy and sell transaction which will directly add liquidity to the A51-BNB or A51-BUSD pairs on PancakeSwap. This essential feature ensures that the trading liquidity for A51 is always increasing providing a bell-curve ramped price floor and increasing the tradability of the A51 token in an automated fashion. This is essential to prevent wild and adverse price flips and dips as the A51 token is bought and sold.

So yes… our community is safe from whale price manipulation

## Safeguarding the Community

We have taken many steps to ensure the token and our ecosystem are fair and safe the community.

Including,

1. Tri-Token and Staking contract Audit with Haechi, Certik and Techrate.

2. The implementation of Automatic Burns

3. The locking of pair liquidity when we list on PancakeSwap for 5 Years (Via DXLocker or Wault Finance Lock)

4. A fair launch via our very own public sale platform before listing with no whitelisting or private sales

Andre_Type_0-,"I'm not an economist. And i assume, with all due respect that you aren't either. So i imagine there are people on this earth who can make a better argument then i can. Forgive me my small mistakes in this; 

I believe tying to precious metal such as gold and silver is better than corn, (with farm subsidies especially but that's a whole other story) because rare earth metals like gold and silver have been steadily rising in value at the same curve as inflation, and historically were used. 

Having the money fixed in value will keep it from being affected by things such as stocks and debt farming. Where banks can loan the same dollar twice, three times or even four, which is what i was told but has been heavily disputed thus far so i'll accept if 300~% is the maximum over-lending a bank can do. 

With a fixed value, banks would have to actually house or effectively offshore a reserve of gold, making it impossible for the bank to collapse, like what happened in the 1930's where rampant lending meant that when people came back to withdraw their own money, they came to find that the 200$ in their account was defacto zero because the bank had gone 'bankrupt' the origin of the term. 

Before the titanic, we were on a gold standard, and it meant that if a bank lent you 20$ they were lending you the value of 20$ worth of gold. And so should they overland, you'd simply collect payment from their gold reserve. 

The system now is far more predatory, and set on getting as many people in debt as possible. Even if at a loss here and there. They loan money at ridiculous interest rates and up the percentage based on how bad your credit score is. Meaning the people who are least likely to pay then back will owe them the most. And the use of digital currency makes this all the easier.

By being on a gold standard, banks would be far less likely to lend money if at all. And all countries (that use the gold standard) would have equal value currency. It would keep outside powers from being able to devalue a nation's dollar. And would greatly aid to a nation's sovereignty. 

The gold standard was abolished by greedy bankers who wished to have the whole world on their dime. And so here we are. With the average debt being something like 5000$ in the hole across the board. 

I just want to see a world where we aren't debt dependant. 

Look at what debt has done to other faculties: post secondary school tuition has skyrocketed. They do this in a tandem effort to not only generate more capital overall, but to hook more people onto bigger bank debts. And with student loans, they are non-default-able. Meaning you owe that for the rest of your life, no bankruptcy can default a student loan.  Look at car prices, look at the property values. Look at your own phone if you chose to finance. It's a polyopoly scheme where big auto works with banks and the housing industry works with banks to ensure two things: 1) inflated product values that can virtually only be paid by debt 2) and a dependancy on debt that will stay with you your whole life with an interest rate that should be criminal. 

I believe a return to gold standard would make all of the predatory debt systems unviable. 

I just think the world would be a better place.",2021-05-07 13:36:43
jtdolla911,"It does take a lot of research and prep to get where you want to be. 40% is in Yearn finance or curve finance on ethereum. They have a few different strategies in that range and some higher with higher risk.

For cheaper and easier learning of defi, look at binance smart chain or the polygon network.

Pancakeswap is the biggest player in BSC. To get used to the world of defi, you can pool some liquidity and then either ride that out and see what happens over time with the accrual of fees. Or you can use those tokens to farm for additional rewards, like Cake. A more advanced strategy is to take your LP tokens and put them into a yield aggregator like Autofarm or Beefy Finance where they compound your rewards multiple times a day so that you get more LP tokens and thus a bigger share of the pool. One pool I'm in with lower risk is a single vault BNB pool that originates at Belt finance and then is deposited into Beefy finance at 40% plus based on compounded rewards.  Riskier pools between beefy and autofarm are paying out 100% plus.

On Polygon, beefy exists there as well. They have pools with high APYs and higher risk and then also have lower risk pools like stablecoin pairs paying 40-60% give or take. 

Risk always exists so don't chase the highest yield as that's usually reserved for the most volatile coins and will lead to huge impermanent loss.  There are lots of options out there, picking a lower fee chain like Binance smart chain or polygon allows you to experiment with different functionality without costing triple digits in gas fees.",2021-05-07 22:09:47
SentenceWorldly7819,"&gt;I am proficient in C but have barely used C++. Is that a dealbreaker for any of these jobs?

It depends, but most likely yes, unless they're willing to hire for potential and let you learn on the job, which would need to be clarified to prevent disappointment.

C++ is a massive federation of programming languages crammed together in a huge standard which hardly any existing compiler fully implements, with a steep learning curve causing a novice to be less than productive for several months. C++ jobs are advertised as C/C++ sometimes because it's overwhelmingly common that one has to work with C libraries in C++ and there is a decent degree of interoperability between the two languages, a feature which has supercharged C++'s popularity and market penetration.

Learning C++ properly is a big investment but it can put you on the fast lane to a high six-figure job if, for example, you're a technologist attracted to finance (HFT folks, but also some techie hedge funds, hire C++ elite programmers and overpay them). The C++ community is however vastly unpleasant in general (worse than the average Stack Overflow level of unpleasantness).",2021-05-07 22:23:48

Again, there are far more than 1 factor working on gas prices, the limiting of North American oil leases is a factor, although it is not the one of the major factors, supply from all sources (OPEC and Non-OPEC), storage, and demand all have bigger influences.

SkipperJanGetrekt,"While I dislike the ""bro DOGE is mooning!1!!!"" crowd as much as the next guy, crypto has legitimate emancipatory potential and some serious political implications.

Firstly, about value component of crypto. Take XMR or BTC (ignore NFTs, DeFi, most tokens, etc, since all of them are more or less digital casinos that, while based and fun, provide little to nothing long term). XMR and BTC are both proof of work cryptos which have unique Elliptic-curve cryptography measures in place. Functionally, the ability to prove ownership of the solution to problems mapped on these curves is no different than somebody holding a piece of gold and saying ""this is scarce, and I know how to acquire more in a repeatable manner, therefore it has measurable value."" Interestingly, what is being assigned value here is an extremely complex character sequence rather than a tangible *thing*. This is no different than 85% of fiat today, except for the fact that it is deflationary and,  by literally any metric one could apply would fall under a form of free speech. Information itself becomes valuable (as I write this I realize why orthodox Marxists might have an issue with crypto).

On to the emancipation bit. Crypto — mostly XMR in this scenario, though the potential exists for others to help contribute here — is capable of completely fucking global finance, consistent governmental authority, and corporate ownership of digital utilities/websites/spaces. The ability for one to use deflationary currency with total anonymity (the IRS still has a bounty out on cracking XMR) is a huge boon for dissidents. Governments and corporations cannot effectively track or control this flow of information and against mega-corps like Google, the ability to privately control your data, or even reap the profits of it yourself, are immense. Additionally, because proof-of-work cryptos can be mined independently (not to be repetitive, but XMR does this better than any other coin due to RandomX and ASIC-resistance) an individual can, with *any* CPU they own, create value. Let me rephrase; *any individual capable of acquiring any form of CPU is capable of building, modifying, and controlling the means of a form of value production*. It hasn't been realized yet, but ""the left"" stands to gain much by looking into the potential of this.

I guess that leads to the environmental bit. This accusation is kind of a grey area. Chinese ASIC farms are a real bitch environmentally, but again, that isn't all crypto, only the most prominent few. Proof of stake is a (dubious) alternative, as is the much more palatable ASIC resistant, decentralized, mining. Also, I want to mention here, the graph some might have seen that states ""New Zealand produced less emissions than BTC last year"" is braindead. It's barely true, the emissions were within like 5%, and BTC has legitimate value several times greater than NZ's entire GDP. If anything, crypto-capitalism is greener in theory than non-digital production ever was.

Anyway, fuck ASICs, fuck banks, and fuck surrendering the power of crypto to ancap boogiemen.",2021-05-08 05:33:26
Phthalleon,"The trig functions can be used for a lot more than just angles. But even if we restrict ourselves to angles then the trig functions can tell you an angle of nor just a triangle but any shape or vector. And vector are used throughout engeniering and physics as most forces are represented as a vector which has direction and that direction is calculated by the trig functions. This also comes up in computer graphics. For example: any curve is created with vectors. In mathematics, the trig functions are used anytime the notion of space and direction comes about. We can use them to represent complex nymbers, we can use them to approximate the area under many curves. They are connected to the exponential and log functions by the infamous euler identity. There are also hyperbolic functions from which we can construct a different type of geometry (non eucledean). The trig functions are often studied in algebra for their symmetric behaviour. The trig functions ""look"" like waves, so it shouldn't be surprising when they come up in wave function in physics. Because cos and sin are periodic and very well behaved, they can be used to model a lot of real world phenomena that has nothing to do with angles. They come up in differential equations all the time that have applications in finance, physics and so on. That's all I can think of on top of my head, I'm missing a lot tho.

northrupthebandgeek,"The way I usually explain it is that landlords are already charging as much as they can to maximize profit; any higher turns away tenants (thus reducing profit) and any lower is just leaving money on the table (thus reducing profit).  So when introducing LVT into the equation, there ain't any room for the landlord to price that into the rent; any attempt to do so just results in less profit.

This is what that graph is illustrating.  Price is already set by the intersection between the supply and demand curves.  In this case, the supply curve is a vertical line - i.e. it's constant, or ""inelastic"".  Being a vertical line, it can't move up or down as a response to taxes (which would shift a non-vertical curve up) or subsidies (which would shift it down), and therefore the equilibrium point - i.e. that market price - is purely a function of demand.  LVT, being a tax on the supply side rather than the demand side, doesn't move that demand curve at all, either; since neither curves move, neither does the market price, leaving the burden entirely on the suppliers.

For more detailed info (including on how to read/interpret that graph), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-microeconomics/unit-2-supply-and-demnd/28/v/example-breaking-down-tax-incidence) has some good and accessible material on supply v. demand, deadweight loss, and the effects of taxation (though it focuses more on demand elasticity rather than supply elasticity - the latter being relevant for the effectiveness of a tax like LVT).",2021-05-08 17:50:22

Movie-Key,"Graduating ust shs- abm student here! Here's a rundown of what I have personally encountered in specialized subjects under ABM hehe. Hope this helps!

Grade 11; 1st Term 

•Business Mathematics 
-I remember having lessons regarding basic business computations such as computing for the: mark-up, rate, simple/compound interest, principal, time, salaries and wages, contribution margin, break-even points, annuity and etc. 
-we had lessons din on turning fractions to decimal/percentage and vice versa AND an overview on problem solving regarding amortization schedules. This subject basically gave us a run-through of what to expect in our Accounting subjects. 
-one significant PeTa that I remember we did is making a business paper (??) lol not sure pero pinagisip kami ng product and we had to propose it kay prof and apply certain computations sa pag-pprice nung product. 

•Research 1: Qualitative and Quantitative (not specialized) 
-lessons regarding what is research, types and kinds, characteristics, business ethics, and the likes. 
-basically dito kayo magiisip ng research topic that should be aligned sa strand. In our case, pinagpili kami kung related ba sa Business/ Workplace/ Management yung topic namin. 
-Im not quite sure kung until chap 2/3 ba tinapos namin for this subj. Pero my advice, dapat sure na sure na kayo sa business topic niyo kasi yan gagamitin niyo for the rest of your shs research journey. (Research 1-3) 

Grade 11; 2nd Term 

•Fundamentals of Accountancy, Business, and Management 1
-ito na,,,,,🥲 HAHAHA charot! Prof namin dito ay kilalang terror kaya kahit ito yung medj madaling phase ng FABM, ginapang pa rin namin HAHAHA. 
-anyway, FABM 1 will give u a quick background on accountancy. From its history to the basic concepts like the basic accounting equation, assets, liabilities, equity, difference of debit and credit, balance sheet, types of business organizations, principles of accounting,  ledger writing and etc. 
-our PeTa for the third quarter was to report the first week's lessons lol and for the fourth quarter we did balancing na ata. 
-if you're not a fan of math like me, I suggest that u do advance reading na as early as possible kasi accounting is a pain in the az lmao. 

•Organization and Management
-one of my faves! OrgMan will basically teach u business and management concepts, leadership theories, philosophies, basic ethics and morale inside a business, traits and characteristics of an entrepreneur, levels of management, what is a manager, and etc. 
-this subject includes a LOT of concepts and names!
-we did a short film as a group that will apply orgman concepts as our PeTa for the third quarter, and for the fourth ata nag collab na sila ng FABM 1?? Not sure.

Grade 12; 1st Term

•Applied Economics
-ngl, I thought magiging easy lang for me itong apec because i really enjoyed our econ class nung jhs, but surprise surprise apec was def more than just simple supply and demand- lo and behold, ginulat kami sa computations! HAHAHA 
-apec will ofc include an intro to economics like the diff of needs from wants, supply and demand, types of economies, theories, opportunity cost, and a lot more of diff computations and charts. 
-our PeTa for the first qua was a paper that would show the history, supply and demand trend, curve, and the factors that would affect it, ng chosen company na mapipili ng group namin. For the second qua, we did a vid regarding the expected GDP growth, employment and unemployment rate, poverty rate, labor force participation rate, and etc of the ph by 2021. 

•Entrepreneurship 
-entrep will obviously teach you what entrepreneur/ship is and the different kinds and types of it.
-for entrep, we were tasked to think of a product/ business as a group that is vv unique. Youll have to do a paper about this, and you also have to be able to successfully propose this product kay prof. I suggest na mag isip na ikaw ng unique and sustainable product kasi idedefend at paniguradong gigisahin kayo ni prof. Use ur creativity! Wag na yung cliche products that are already available sa market. I recommend na now pa lang, mag list down ka na. 
-we were also tasked to distribute a survey that would gather data sa mga possible na target market ng product namin. This survey will also be able to help u understand the demographics, psychographics, and technographics of ur product. 

•FABM 2
-our prof gave us a week worth of time to reestablish what we have learned from FABM1 using the prof's given audio-visual materials and presentation. Pero if ur prof wasnt able to give u that time, I suggest mag quick review ka lang sa FABM1 basics. 
-fabm2's lessons included: statement of changes in equity, statement of financial position, inventories, statement of cash flows, statement of comprehensive income, etc. 
-For our PeTa's, sa pagkakaalala ko, we were tasked to use excel to apply the said lessons. FABM1 and 2 will indeed be challenging, pero super satisfying na kapag tama pagkakagawa! Hehehe. I suggest, ngayon pa lang you familiarize yourself na with basic excel use kasi tbh, my groupmates and I had such a hard time operating in excel kasi di kami marunong even the basics

•Principles of Marketing
-one of my faves again! Our prof was very approachable and considerate kaya naging easy ang subject na to for us. This subject will basically teach you what marketing is, diff of traditional and new media, pestel, porter's, swot, 4P's of marketing, etc etc. 
-for our PeTa, I believe nag collab sila ng entrep for the paperwork. We were tasked basically to analyze our group's business/product, applying the pestel, porter's, swot, and 4P's. 

Grade 12; 2nd Term 

•Business Enterprise Simulation 
-youll be surprised kung gaano ka interconnected ang mga subjs sa abm lmao since some of the concepts learned sa POM and Entrep will be repeated here. BES taught us the process of business implementation, what to consider in planning the business, how businesses can be improved using again, the diff kinds of analysis used in POM and Entrep. I suggest na you read more on the said analysis methods para maging easy na rin for you and your group. 
-for our PeTa, we were tasked to interview a real business venture and gather important data about them for a BUSINESS PLAN. (History, milestones, products and services, prices, employees, promotional strategies, place, financial data, etc etc.) Youll be tasked to do a quick market research as well. 
-ngl, this business plan was the LONGEST paperwork we've done during our shs. So please dont cram this! In our case, weve been given a month naman ata to finish this. Wag niyo sana i-delay nang i-delay just because of the loose schedule, kasi again, mahaba to swear. 

▪︎Business Ethics and Social Responsibility 
-MY FAVE! Some orgman concepts are present here. BESR will teach u basic concepts on business and organizational ethics. Laws and case studies will be present here as well. Super interesting ang subj na to kasi it will teach you about corporate social responsibility, laws, employer's duties and responsibilities, termination process, code of conduct, employee's rights, environmental protection, etc etc. 
-for our third qua PeTa, we were tasked to search for any recent case/lawsuit of any local company that violated the Core Principles of Good Governance. You will analyze and interpret the court decision as well. For the fourth qua, we were tasked to do a socio-economic plan in collab wt the business we had in BES. 

•Business Finance
-this subj is a continuation of Fabm1 and 2 much focused nga lang siya on Company records. Again, we mostly used excel for this subj. So i suggest na before mag grade 12, matutuhan niyo na ang basic computations within excel. 
-you'll be tackling investments, stocks, personal finance, banking, projecting SCI, FS, tools in analyzing Financal statements, etc etc. 
-our PeTa for the third quarter was an informative video by group about the diff investment types. For the fourth qua naman we were tasked to do an excel work again on a given company. 

Extra tips and reminders! 
-invest on a good calcu! This will really help u bigtime!
-practice healthy relationships as classmates, no to toxic competition and hilahan pababa :) 
-grades and experiences will ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAAAAYS depend on ur prof. Totoo ang kasabihan na paswertihan talaga ng prof sa ust shs. 
-ust shs wilk indeed teach u na kahit gaano ka kagaling at kataas noong jhs, may mga tao pa ring 'mas gifted' kaysa sayo. And thats okay! Hindi naman palamangan ang shs. Ang important dito ay makagraduate kayong lahat as a class, hindi ang hilahan pababa. 
-minsan kakaway talaga si line of 7. Again, depende talaga sa prof yan. Iiyak mo lang saglit tas bawiin bigla sa next qua! Im a 90gwa-ish person nung jhs, and ginulat din ako ng line of 7 nung shs. Iiyak mo lang saglit and iaral ng husto sa susunod!
-lastly, enjoy SHS! MAIKLI LANG ANG DALAWANG TAON! sikaping pangibabawin ang saya kaysa sa pressure! Kayang kaya mo yan! ;)

rdsf138,"&gt;It’s more complicated than people think in my opinion. Anywhere where there are dense populations like those states, problems are bound to creep up as housing issues spawn and then ripple into other issues in said state. That’s not to say it has nothing to do with the government, as Newsom has contributed to resentment towards the state because of extremely restrictive covid lockdowns that have hurt the working class, not just the owner class. 

 It's amazing how YouTube and the least respectable news outlets in the country just start some hearsays ad nauseum and people just take it as the concrete reality. 

 No, there isn't an exodus from California to Texas. 

 And bless Newsom for following scientific guidelines rather than fearing reactionary fervor on the internet and saving thousands upon thousands of lives with necessary restrictive measures that also saved the sanitary system from collapsing in the worst peak of infections. 

""Don't buy into myth of a great California exodus. Facts tell a different story""

""But lies only survive until facts emerge. And the facts don’t support the myth of a great California exodus. One magazine reported last fall that California lost more than 3% of its populace to other states over the last year. Not so. In fact, about 175,000 California residents moved to other states in 2020. That’s about four-tenths of one percent.""

"" The departures were more than made up for in new births and legal foreign immigration, which created a 21,200 person population increase from July 1, 2019, to July 1, 2020, reports the state Department of Finance.""

""California appears to be flattening the curve. But its testing lags behind other states""

""Some doctors have said California appears to be succeeding at “flattening the curve”, meaning slowing the spread so hospitals have enough resources and workers to manage the number of cases. The California governor, Gavin Newsom, said on Tuesday that “the current modeling is on the lower end of our projection”. Last month, Newsom had warned that more than half of the state could be infected within two weeks. “We are in a completely different place than the state of New York,” Newsom said at a briefing on Wednesday. “And I hope we continue to be, but we won’t unless people continue to practice physical distancing""

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-flatten-curve

""California coronavirus lockdowns will ‘rescue’ hospital capacity, Fauci says""

""Gov. Gavin Newsom imposed a strict stay-at-home order over the weekend after the state fell below 15% capacity in intensive care units because of rising coronavirus cases. Newsom warned last week that the lockdown would be triggered regionally when ICU capacity dipped under that level.""

""New lockdown orders in California will rescue strained hospitals, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert.""

 The lockdowns are not public health policy, they are part of a globalist coup\\Putsch entitled 'the great reset' which will be 'the new normal'.

They began having their propagandists whisper these terms in our ears even before the first 2 weeks to slow the curve were up. We have seen elderly well-connected plutocrats like Nancy Pelosi ignore the lockdowns.

the lockdowns are a psychological warfare attack. This is the only way to make sense of them. From a health policy point of view makes no sense. From an economic POV makes no sense unless you understand how global finance works post-LIBOR fixing revelations and the 2008 bailouts.

Covid = globalist psyop.

Venusinthefirst,"Do you mean the Central Valley of CA? So they would have to finance their second home with a 30 year mortgage. Do they want to be landlords? Are they living nearby to be the  property managers? 
If so, have them check out the Bigger Pockets website, show them the formulas and calculations they’ll need to make to ensure they’re charging the right rent, finding the right tenants, etc. It’s a lot to think about and frankly the market is at the highest it’s ever been. Buying in Fresno for example isn’t the hottest place on earth so if the market tanks in a year they could be underwater fast.
The Roth IRA is a great idea and you could suggest they put a smaller amount in to start with say $10k. When they see how easy it is and they only have to check their account once in a while (assuming you pick a good ETF like VOO) they’ll probably see the light.

The thought was inspired by reading endless bullshit about Buffett and Munger (and Schiff, to some extent). Sorry, gramps. Your system's being disrupted.

I have a lot of social justice activist types as friends who think I'm Mr. Tinfoil Hat Libertarian, and associate crypto with right wingness.

Oof, this is a tough one. My personal favorite is Anti-Fragile, since that's where I started, and it feels more like an all encompassing philosophy for moving forward, rather than the first 2 which are more diagnostics of what to look out for. Black Swan is probably his 2nd most impressive imo, but Fooled By Randomness is more foundational. Skin in the game is also great for incentive design which is a big part of operations design, so honestly I'd recommend them all, but let me describe them for you and let you choose to suit your situation:

* Fooled by Randomness: Why statistics aren't truth. What success really looks like, what is unseen by the data, particularly hidden risks like debt and overleverage. How to think more critically about statistics
* The Black Swan: What hides in the data and how to protect against it. How to protect yourself, and potentially profit from, major blowups, particularly in finance. Also fantastic at breaking down the issues with the Guassian Bell Curve, and why almost every model gets the mark wrong
* Anti-Fragile: How to build things that get stronger. Why when you build a system it doesn't need to be great, but it needs to be adaptable - to see an accident, take in feedback, adjust accordingly, and come back stronger. If this is repeatable, you get things like our airline safety record of 99.99999%. If you don't have a system of feedback and incorporated learnings from aircraft crashes, well, you wouldn't have many people flying. Also, how do you protect from downside risk? How do you make sure you're okay in every eventuality? Always be thinking about survival to make sure your system lives another day and grows stronger
* Skin in the Game: Why incentives matter, how when done right they make everything work decently and when done wrong they cause disasters that only hurt the innocent. Charlie Munger says to spend 99% of your time on incentives, so there could be a strong case to be made for this one, but not the one that grabbed me, although I read it only recently while not working and not being able to implement anything, so maybe just bad timing for me.",2021-05-09 14:57:21

sphw24,"Sick to death of all cryptos being labelled as merely 'currencies', their usecase far exceeds just being a method of payment.

Decentralised stablecoins like DAI are collateral backed, then using these stablecoins you can seek yield that far surpasses any bank interest rate. At the same time you can also possibly be earning a stake in a valuable new crypto itself, like Curve Finance.

Threshing_Press,"Personally, while I enjoy reading about the tech, I love the tech aspects and the excitement of watching this historic shift away from traditional (and, imo, corrupt AF) finance, I get that this is gonna happen and the reasons behind it. I embrace it as a sign of what's to come and I'll give you my reasons... 

First off, it actually strikes me that a lot of you guys and gals who have been in it for the long haul seem battered and almost oblivious to the moment you're in. As though the crazy volatility and bear runs of the past have beaten you into a state of constant vigilance as to when the market will suddenly turn on you....

But when those Winklevii twins said a tsunami of money is coming in last year, they weren't kidding. It has just barely started. I think you have to realize three things to understand this unique moment... 

1) The stock market is at ATH's day after day pumped by the Fed with insanely dangerous amounts of overleveraged and too-easy (and cheap) to access liquidity. In those markets, a small number of players have control over the levers and MANY, MANY tricks that the average equity investor doesn't have. 

2) The big investment banks, hedge funds, and other large players in equities are not gonna stop chasing yield...but the stock market looks tired and, quite honestly, f'king boring compared to crypto. There's  nothing new other than possible crypto ETF's, crypto related IPO's and, well... anything crypto related. Or maybe SpaceX? 

I have to ask, do any of you really think these grotesquely greedy dirtbags aren't now doing everything they can to chase the crypto related absurdities in profit that remain possible? Do you really think they're going to start a bear market run by distributing patterns in equities while NOT playing with their profit from the last decade of Fed money printer go brrrr leveraged stock buyback induced mooning P/E ratios and other shenanigans? 

What kind of profits or market sizes have liquidity to burn by moving into crypto you ask? That leads to #3...

3) People often compare BTC, accounting for half the market, to gold, saying, ""oh, well if it captures half the market of gold as an inflation hedge, maybe we'll hit $4 trillion or $5 trillion in market cap. 

Really? Cause where I'm standing, BTC is gold, a speculative crazy ass mooning stock like Tesla, an options market with crazy volatility (and yet, unlike options, you can just hold onto it like a stock!), a stable store of portable value like REAL PHYSICAL GOLD if you get a Ledger X, and at least five or six other ""fun"" aspects of the market all rolled into one. 

The market for gold is like $10 trillion. The market for derivatives is estimated to have a notional value of anywhere from 640 trillion to ONE QUADRILLION. Yes, QUADRILLION. Add in a bunch of stocks that make huge runs followed by crazy dips, AND a portion of the casino player options gamblers, and you have the makings of something capable of going MUUUUCH higher than just taking a portion of the gold market as an inflationary hedge. 

This is before you add in Etherium, Binance, the other top few hundred coins, their use cases, DeFi revolutionizing banking and interest yielding assets that DWARF what these greedy, uncooperative, unimaginative, and incapable of innovating traditional banks are paying, liquidity pools, and, yes, shit coin meme cryptos like DOGE.

It's the birth of an ecosystem that will have tentacles connecting it ALL at some point and the tech will enter every single aspect of our lives where money, the web, and a great use case for the tech intersect. 

So I just feel like... enjoy this... if you have been in it for a while, this is it, man, THIS is YOUR moment. I applaud you all for getting it here and wish I was as smart and as visionary as ya'll. 

It's never gonna be what it was ever again. The writing is on the wall with the news and the literal fear in the voices of anyone representing traditional financial interests every day now... I have family members who have never uttered the word bitcoin or crypto asking me how to get set up with coinbase and what their first buy should be. 

And those traditional financial interests SHOULD be scared.... because they think they missed something or are about to be exposed by something or made obsolete or all of the above. And it's all true but they're also gonna move into the sector with tremendous amounts of money we haven't even begun to approach the upward curve leading to the apex of yet.

I think this is history right now and damn it's exciting to watch and read about and invest in for my own future and the future of my children. 

I get lamenting that it seems like it's all about the money now and the dangers therein, but it's going to do that, then morph into also being about the tech and I think it'll be years before you can even see what the new definition of a bear market in crypto looks like. Perhaps  ""bear"" market means BTC has been below $200k for a whole year and DOGE as a harbinger of irrational speculation is ""only"" worth $26 a coin. But I doubt it's right around the corner. I just have an extremely difficult time believing that considering the tired state of equities at ATH's when compared to a wholly ""new"" and emerging market that has the market cap of like one or two big tech companies combined.",2021-05-10 10:39:54

Having absolutely no money to enjoy on luxuries

Landlords nagging them for the rent

Having to study whilst subconsciously worrying about spare cash

Working odd hours in jobs that they do not even enjoy

The above is typical of a world where college students are working themselves almost into the ground trying to pay for their education. They know the discomfort and humiliation of repeatedly having to confront the unhelpful financial team at the administration office. The situation can be even more challenging when you are limited to options like;

1. Living without food and pay for college or

&amp;#x200B;

2. Leave college to work full time and come back later.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what can be done to alleviate the situation?

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately, there are some creative ways to pay off any education debt, even though most students don't have a great deal of money. The reality is that students have not been taught the basics of savings and risk assessments. This should unfailingly be part of the learning and orientation curve during the first year of college, if not the final years of high school.

&amp;#x200B;

And what about students being able to pay off their education debt and making a living using the very creative method as alluded to earlier? What is this method and how is it related to making money online as a struggling student?

&amp;#x200B;

One of the most creative ways for paying of education debt is through the method of Affiliate Marketing.

&amp;#x200B;

The hardest thing about affiliate marketing is knowing the process of what, why, and when of the requirements to become a successful affiliate marketer.

&amp;#x200B;

The guesswork can be taken out of the process by a simple review of different products, eBooks, and websites as submitted by current successful students

&amp;#x200B;

For an affiliate marketing program to work for students from all walks and areas of life, it needs to address at least 3, if not all 5 of the following;

&amp;#x200B;

Provide excellent marketing support material

Provide comprehensive tutorials and authentic case studies on exactly how to build a successful affiliate campaign from start to finish.

Be able to be part of a community or forum that offers invaluable advice from expert affiliate marketers.

Provide administrative support at no extra cost.

It has been tried and successfully proven by many people ranging from newbies to highly experienced.

It is important for a due diligence process to be followed and with easy research access via the internet nowadays, this should not be a problem at all. The beauty of the online marketing approach is that it is low cost, with a low barrier to entry, and thus ideal for students with little access to start-up capital. There is absolutely no reason for any student with basic computer literacy to not be able to tackle the debt burden through a proven and authentic affiliate marketing program.",2021-05-11 10:40:35

**I don't think we should conflate a bull market with a bubble.** All of crypto is performing extremely well due to speculative trading. It's hip and in style. That means that there are many bubbles *within* crypto and DeFi, but that doesn't mean that \*crypto\* or \*DeFi\* are bubbles themselves.

As long as liquidity is still being provided to DeFi pools, then I don't see how transacting in DeFi cools off. As long as being an LP still provides returns that outpace fiat savings (low bar to clear), then I don't see how liquidity dries up.

If there continues to be liquidity, and transactions continue to take place, then DeFi is alive and well. IMO, the only thing holding it back is the learning curve and ease of use. There is money dying to flow into DeFi when the barrier to entry is lowered. For all intents and purposes, DeFi is the way forward and it's barely started.

The thing to be careful about is whether or not you want to invest in coins/tokens/projects that may be individual bubbles, like the dot com movement in the 90s. But I'm having a hard time seeing danger in working with BTC, ETH, or stablecoins long term.",2021-05-11 19:45:26
guitarf1,"Remind of the time when people could autonomously stake their tulip bulbs to earn passive income, become a liquidity provider, yield farm, swap between tulips or lend 24/7 all from home without a centralized account ie. Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?

Once you've driven off the fiat ramp, you actually own and control your crypto keys, which can't be said about a centralized bank account. No one needs to verify or check that you're swapping some ETH for another token or buying an NFT to trade. There's no transaction limits. However, there is a varying degree of responsibility (security practices, properly tracking and paying taxes, etc) and a learning curve to get over.

I remember the time it clicked for me: I was able to pay and settle an advertising deal in a few seconds to another country with just their ETH address. No IBAN or SWIFT or adding a payee and waiting for a wire transfer to execute and settle. You can transmit value from one address to another without a middle person and transparency track the transaction. The receiving party can opt to convert their crypto to fiat or a stablecoin, which is pegged to fiat but can be exchanged through various chains and later converted to fiat and into a traditional bank account.

Crypto happened to change my life forever. I got in and out when I did, but there's always someone else who got in earlier or lower than you--you'll rarely sell at the top. Accepting the reality of your decisions is an individualistic emotional exercise. The markets have been working in bull/bear cycles so far; gains are gains after all. Set your goals and try to stick with them or just wait things out until something becomes significant to your situation. Do not take this as investment advice but I would want to see a many month trend of lower prices to buy in long term. Now or anytime is great for short term activity despite the historically high prices.

The whole thing of crypto having no intrinsic value is a pretty sloppy argument that I've been hearing for years. Crypto isn't traditional finance or regulated as such. I don't believe anything has intrinsic value. An individual and society give value to things. Sometimes you don't need a persistent or objective value to make gains in the short term. If you're getting stuck at this part, maybe crypto isn't for you in this form.

All of the naysayers out there have their own beliefs and opinions. Some of my friends felt the same 4-5 years ago and I wonder if they ever came around. Not everyone is going to be ready at the same time. You can be scared about something new or not understand it, but that doesn't make anything more or less true. It also doesn't get you closer to exploring a new frontier. I can attest that through the noise, there is enough incentive that everyone should at least hedge a little into crypto. Just owning a little gives an inherent incentive to learn more about what you bought. You may not like it or understand everything, but it's an experience where you will at least come out knowing more than you started with, even if your portfolio goes into the dumps for a while.

Obviously 10,000+ coins won't all have value in the future. Many are just clones or created as iterations of other ideas and code. I still dabble with things and own a little of various coins that are both well-known and just for fun as moonshot bets. I believe in a cashless society and crypto is in the frontier of facilitating that eventual transition into the future decades. How big of a part it will play is anyone's guess.",2021-05-12 00:30:00
Burn-O-Matic,"The majority of people in the country are unable to install and own solar.  Lack of money, ability to finance, and actually owning a roof (or suitable single family roof) being chief reasons.  And that seems to be a growing problem with trends of housing development and home affordability. 

In a way you are helping things at the macro level and with climate change, but you are not helping with energy affordability nor resiliency.   In the currently utility model where fixed infrastructure costs are put on variable usage, costs are getting allocated down the income distribution.  Look at ERCOT and CAISO trends and you can see how the steep penetration of solar creates unique challenges that increases the needs for system upgrades and battery additions.  

There are some clear solutions to help address this including community solar where people mentioned above can subscribe and/or co-own a part of solar projects.

Sometimes we can be a bit rough around the edges, but we have lots of heart. Thank you (and u/dlauer!) for joining us on this journey. It's an honor to learn from specialized apes like you.  


Despite being an honors student, I *always* felt stupid when it came to math, money, and finance. My parents didn't teach me anything but shame and secrecy around the household budget. Right out of high school, I had 2 kids in quick succession and spent 20 years in a marriage marked by financial instability. Because of inexperience and my husband's addiction, we had 2 bankruptcies, several buy here/pay here cars repossessed, and a foreclosure (2006, a bit ahead of the curve).   


I perservered and obtained my degree, built a career, and am now single with my own home. While I manage OK, I still feel intimidated when it comes to money.

Pay attention to where people that can afford risk put their money versus what they say. For example if you've been watching Andrei on YouTube he's been trying to push doge for a few weeks but he didn't even own any doge (unless he lied) and finally bought a little just to be involved but it's because his whole foundation was built on smart investing.

twilight-actual,"True, but borrowing assumes that the asset will never crash.  And if it does, you get margin called and either have to cough up more or lose your assets.  In the end, that means that what was once cheap can become much more expensive.

Also, many people get in the habit of leveraging themselves to the hilt.  So there’s only so far you can go.

Finally, we’d ideally like to stop treating crypto as an asset and treat it as a currency.  At least choose one deflationary coin that can handle the tx scalability needs of our economy.  In the end, this will have a similar pricing curve as BTC over time, but as we all get paid in it, it’s basically a crypto that everyone dollar cost averages on a monthly basis.  So, the asset pricing becomes much more stable.

In this model, you make the down with your crypto asset and borrow the rest.  But the monthly payments are coming off your crypto as well.  And if they’re denominated in that currency then that would suck, as each payment becomes more expensive than the last.  But if they’re dollar based, than each payment would become cheaper than the last.

Guess which direction finance will eventually go?  Toss up.  Contracts denominated in a deflationary asset heavily discourage borrowing, which would torpedo their entire business model.  But for the loans they are able to cut, they’re making a mint.

This scenario could just as easily be BTC, but I think another currency that can natively scale to global tps needs (without multiple layers and related security issues) makes more sense.  But history has always seemed to favor first movers, so who knows?

&gt; Furthermore, given the fundamental law of supply, when a greater quantity of a good is demanded, a profit-maximising firm will be supplying that good at a higher price (or yes, increase production, but imagining that we're at/nearing full capacity, it's not exactly an option, espcially with capacity taking a longer time to increase than it takes to raise prices)

So that's a view of demand. The idea would be that if a greater amount of a good is demanded and they're not producing that much of a good, they would increase the price and demand would fall in line with their price level. That's sort of the classical view. But in a lot of ways, increasing the price in response to demand might not produce a linear reduction in nominal demand for a product. All of the sudden no one might buy it, and then you have to lower the price again and that's going to look bad i think in terms of the business model. It can happen. But a lot of times, when firms are just ""sold out"" of something, they don't then raise the price to reduce demand for their products and maximize profits. They may just have backlogs of orders and get to them eventually. Doesn't always happen. But it's not entirely a definite thing. 

But what needs to be understood is that, ceteris paribus, an increase in demand is not going to change the unit cost i.e. the rate of profit per sale won't change. If they want to increase production, they can get a loan to hire more people expecting that the rate of profit per sale won't change and that they will be able to get more gross profits and thus be able to pay off the debt and still make gains. 

On top of that, if firms are doing that thing where they just raise the price because they can, that's price gouging in my book if they're not incurring increasing costs. 

If all potential labor are employed, they may have to pay people more if a single firm wants to expand their output. If firms start fighting over employees, then yeah, you could get some inflation, because aggregate demand is also going up as firms pay higher wages. 

So it comes back to labor market tightness and market concentration. 

Reorganizing the economy and allowing firms to do that could produce some growth as well because different people may be more productive in different jobs. 

&gt;What this means is that we get the Phillips curve, where employment level is proportional to a polynomial of the inflaiton, i.e. fuller employment means disporportionately higher inflation.

it's really not a curve. it's really more of a vertical line. Full employment means inflationary bias, and so the potential for accelerating inflation is open. (and note that having a large JG pool would mean \*loose\* full employment, i.e. the larger the pool, the less tight the labor market would be). Inflationary bias is really just this qualitative and subjective thing about power in the economy. Codifying as some mathematical equation leaves it open to pre-emptive policy response contraction before inflation is actually seen. There are a lot of reasons why ""full employment"" may not actually have inflationary bias e.g. employment is counting underemployment, the economy is open and the potential for outsourcing (or automation? maybe?) is ""disciplining"" wages (I hate using that word), or the economy is highly diversified and there's not a lot of union organization as well as lots and lots of contracts between firms about employee poaching. 

&gt;That's not to say that automatic stabilisers aren't a good thing. Indeed, the MMTist approach of setting tax brackets to inflations seems very apt. However, that might not solve everything.

Yeah, it's not meant to solve everything, just to be an automatic first line of defense that doesn't require a policy response. Income taxes are particularly robust at offsetting demand because you have to save as you earn income. The more income you earn, the more you have to save. So income taxes are a pretty intense friction. Fiscal multipliers can be like between -1.0 and -3.0 in aggregate. Most of the time it'll do a pretty good job. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Indeed, and I believe a fair few political economists have looked at this as a solution, finding a strong correlation between oligopolies/uncompetitive markets just before supply shocks. 

Yeah, it's because they're not thinking of inflation as a human conflict but some monetary phenomenon. It's such a disservice to the left to think of inflation as some reaction that's like physics or something and that it's something that happens to the money or whatever. 

&gt;Though in an increasingly global economy, where economies of scale are very much needed for success, it can sometimes be tough to balance the two out.

Right, yeah. Really Open economies are going to reduce the potential for the a real income conflict. But why that's happening is because of unions being disciplined by the threat of outsourcing, or just that the labor market is loose because of outsourcing. (And it doesn't have to be labor in some 19th century sense. It can be coders or international remote workers of any sort.) The potential for remote work in the domestic economy also eliminates a lot of potential for unemployment to be structural and thus tight with a higher level of unemployment i.e. the world being bigger makes the employment market looser on its own WHICH OF COURSE, should mean more government spending, deficit or not. It's not a good a thing at all if a government doesn't/can't spend. It's a really bad thing. It's a race to the bottom kind of thing. 

The point being that NAIRU (or NAIBER for that matter) is really not calculable ex-ante and we shouldn't do it \*at all\*. The confidence interval will never be high enough for the government (or the fed) to pre-emptively and discretionarily \*prevent\* inflation because of the myriad qualitative factors and thus the imperfections of our quantitative data. 

&gt;I do though somewhat worry that it might make the richer and more competitively driven individuals flee as they can get (shall we say) non-capped salaries elsewhere.

As far as I'm concerned, those people are sociopaths and they're not helping. Let them leave. Their are plenty of non-sociopathic individuals who are intelligent enough to organize production in society, IMO. I don't want to be an apologist for that sort of behavior. They should go be a leech somewhere else. Good riddance. Them leaving doesn't mean the government can't spend because of a loss in tax revenues. 

&gt;Equally, limiting markups may be a slightly dangerous path to follow- development of underground economies and all that, but I don't want to be too dismissive either.

Well, yeah, maybe. You're talking about someone buying all the store's toilet paper and selling it on eBay at a higher price, right? Filling up their trunk with gasoline and selling dixie cups of it out of a bathtub, right? I think in extreme circumstances, there is justification to limit customer purchases just like what happened during the pandemic. It's in the interest of firms because consumers might expect them to be out of something next time they need it and not go to that store again. But that's not going to happen with price and wage guideposts. They're merely guideposts. And that sort of already happens in finance and whatnot with speculation, but you're talking about it extending to consumer products. Like, what if bill gates or elon musk or jeff bezos bought all of the toilet paper in the US at a slightly higher price and then sold it back to consumers at an even higher price. Such a thing could happen. Doesn't seem super likely. But hysteria makes people do that sort of thing. Also, who would even have the time for that sort of thing. Idk.

cake_flattener3,"&gt;It's just immigration is pretty objectively a net good for society.

""Immigration"" in general is a net good but it does not follow that ""more immigration = more benefits."" You have a relatively small number of migrants who make a major contribution to our society (skilled workers such as doctors, engineers, finance etc.) and a large number who take out more than they give back (less- or unskilled workers who intend to only stay temporarily and send most of their earnings overseas) and are mainly imported as a way to hold wages down. That 2% figure is nonsensical, just look at the volume of complaints from bosses about having to pay people more whenever there's talk about migration declining.

I suspect that if you cut total migration in half the net gain from immigration would go *up*, provided the cuts targeted the bottom end of the curve and left the high-skilled alone.",2021-05-17 22:49:17

First of all I have MetaMask installed in my browser. This is a crypto wallet and it’s how I interact with other crypto platforms online.

Once that is installed I switch from ethereum to matic network. To do this you have to add a custom rpc, and google ‘matic network MetaMask’ to fill that in. I use matic because it’s transaction fees are 0.0001 cents and take 5 seconds. Ethereum costs ~$50-$100 per transaction because it’s overdue for some upgrades

To get your crypto on to the matic network is pretty tough as it’s a newer blockchain, even if you buy matic itself it’s still on the ethereum blockchain, if you get to this stage pm me and I will send you 2 matic to get you playing around! :) and if you are more interested I will let you know how to bridge money to matic.

First I go to aave and connect my wallet, I 
Then make sure I’m on the polygon version of aave. 

Please note: Matic and Polygon are the exact same thing, matic had a name change to polygon recently

I then deposit my matic (WARNING: do not deposit all otherwise you will not have currency to pay transaction costs and your matic will get stuck! I like to keep .5 in wallet) 

Then go to borrow and borrow usdt against that matic. Borrow with a health factor of your choosing. The riskier the health factor the more often you’ll have to check on it to make sure your matic doesn’t get liquidated if it’s price goes below the amount you’ve borrowed.

Then you put the borrowed usdt into curve finance. google curve finance polygon. Click on the aave pool and deposit your usdt there. You will notice you are earning more interest there then you will be owing from the loan.

That’s it. 

I don’t know if you will get through all of that but if you even get 5% of the way I think you will start to see how interesting and deep the crypto space is!",2021-05-18 04:10:20

Roboticus_Aquarius,"I should have focused on Finance in college.  The common track was a Degree in Bus Admin with two ""emphasis"", one in Acctg, one in Finance.  My first finance class was with a professor unhappy to be teaching undergrads, and he was making it clear to us.  I was studying 4-6 hours a day for this class and scoring 50-60% on the quizzes every other day.   I was already on Academic Probation because I was in the bottom 10% of admissions to the 2-year business program (for Jr/Sr.); I couldn't really afford a lousy grade.  I dropped the class at the three week deadline.  In retrospect, finance is likely where I belonged.  I finished with an accounting emphasis only, and instead of finance, I minored in American Lit.   The Lit minor has provided dividends of it's own, so I don't regret that... I mostly just regret going into accounting instead of finance.  I've never really enjoyed accounting, though the basics are simple enough.  In retrospect, my first semester grades were near the top of the school, so I probably would have been fine staying in the class.  I did check the grades at the end of the semester, the distribution was a shifted, inverted bell curve (Lots of D's &amp; F's, almost no B's or C's, but some A's.)

Almost ten years later, working in accounting that entire time, I jumped to finance (just forecasting and measurements, not corporate finance or anything), and my career took off.  I suspect I'd have had a more interesting career in investment banking or the like.

countvonruckus,"This is a great question and there's a several things to consider as you go about it. The first thing to do is determine how big security is going to be as a part of your business strategy. This will depend on the nature of your organization. If you're working in a heavily regulated field like government, finance, or healthcare, it's probably going to be a pretty big part of your organization since security requirements there are pretty steep. If you're doing work that's less sensitive, it'll probably be a smaller part. Cybersecurity risk is just like other business risks and it should be addressed in proportion to how much it impacts your business.

Once you have a basic idea of how much security will impact accomplishing business objectives, you're in a position to determine how to tackle getting the necessary security expertise to really manage your situation. It's not unusual for business leaders to significantly underestimate security needs, so it's important to be prepared to adjust expectations after getting input from an expert. For most organizations with average security needs this will mean finding a security consultant or hiring a security lead to help scope and plan your security program. For organizations with smaller security footprints, this may be all you need. In those circumstances, a virtual chief information security officer (vCISO) is a good choice. It's similar to having an attorney on retainer; the vCISO helps get you set up for a few weeks, advises you on what to do going forward, and steps in periodically when needed after that. 

For organizations with larger security needs you'll need dedicated security staff. Lots of organizations choose contractors (and I've been a contractor for most of my career), but I recommend at least one person to be your security head be a direct hire. This can be a security manager, a security subject matter expert on your IT team, or a chief information security officer (CISO) that reports to the board or C-suite (depending on your business and security needs). This person will select a security framework and start prioritizing security initiatives to build your security program. Initially you'll probably have a lot of security services contracted out through groups that provide things like monitoring, incident response, auditing, penetration testing, and threat intelligence, but you may end up doing these things in house as your program gets more mature. If you have specific security needs, such as if you're in a regulated industry or employ nontraditional IT technology, you'll want to hire a security contracting group specializing in that niche to make sure you're going in the right direction.

As the security program develops, things will go through a maturity curve. The formal steps for this curve are initial, managed, defined, quantitatively managed, and optimizing (called the capability maturity model), but in general terms it means you'll start with a lot of putting out fires and implementing things in a chaotic way. As this goes on, a good security program will become more formal, more organized, and more effective. Eventually, this may grow to the point where you're doing most everything in-house at a high level, but it's important to realize that not everything needs to achieve the highest maturity. For some organizations, a simple, relatively immature security program is all that is required. Others may require much more, and a good security manager will be able to guide your organization to the right level of security for your business needs. 

Sorry for the long post. TL;DR Figure out generally how much security you think you need, then hire an expert to help get you to where you need to go.",2021-05-20 23:44:51

RobThorpe,"So, flavorless_beef has described what's going on. As serendipitouswaffle says the name for this is the backward-bending supply-curve of labour. Now, I'm just going to criticise it for a minute.

It is definitely true that leisure has increased greatly over time. Since the industrial revolution working hours have fallen a lot. So, as pay increases people definitely choose to take more leisure.

However, no employer buys *all labour*. Each business buys only particular kinds of labour. There are labour markets for people who specialize in different tasks.

Of course, some people have multiple skills, and that matters for these labour markets. What happens if the hourly income of, say, manicurists increases sharply? It may be that manicurists don't consider themselves rich enough for that to make much difference. So, they carry on working harder than before to make more money (the substitution effect).

What happens though if the hourly income of investment bankers rises? Well, the existing investment bankers may decide to take more time off. They may decide that the additional income they earn does not satisfy their preferences more than extra leisure would. So does that means that the quantity of investment banking hours supplied falls? Not necessarily. That's because there are other people who could move into that field. There are retired investment bankers, there are people who have moved into closely related fields in finance. So, when investment bankers hourly income rises these other groups will move into the market. Even if the hours worked by the pre-existing investment bankers does fall it makes it unlikely that the hours worked in the industry overall will fall. Instead the industry will suck in people from other industries.

I have never seen good empirical evidence that actual labour supply curves do bend backwards in practice. If anyone has any I'd be interested.",2021-05-21 13:42:16

EvidenceBasedOnly,"&gt; The thing is, taxing a dollar of income and giving it back doesn't have a neutral economic effect.

Eh, that's very misleading. In isolation it absolutely does have neutral economic effect. Particularly in the modern era of digital finance.

&gt; Taxation has a lot of economic consequences like lower innovation, etc so we have to use it as efficiently as possible.

When people make statements like that what they are *really* talking about is marginal rates. People are more encouraged to be productive the lower the marginal rate they are facing at the brackets they are in or near.

In simple terms we have a unary function taking in income as input and spitting out post-tax-and-transfer income as output. The steeper you make that curve the more innovative people are encouraged to be, however the lower you have to make the left hand side, decreasing welfare for the poorest in the short run.

So in concrete terms giving a middle or upper class person a fixed tax break equivalent to the UBI would have no economic benefit over just using UBI.

My personal preference for UBI over NIT isn't really about big picture economics due to the aforementioned lack of difference, it's about administration and bureaucracy.

If someone loses their job and doesn't have much in savings, a UBI is running perpetually, perhaps even as often as daily transfers (it's the internet era after all), and if they get a job again they can deal with the taxes in tax season or via withholding.",2021-05-24 12:34:39

\-You don't have to decide today or tomorrow

\-Think long-term.  Life is long and while getting into the workforce right away may be a good move today, developing a higher-yield career will be more benefit in the long run

\-Be adaptive and diverse.  Life will throw you curve-balls and you may find yourself with a very specific skillset that's not in demand.

**1.  What do “DAOs” mean to you and why do you think the Harmony Foundation is setting this DAO up?**  
DAOs further implements and helps decentralization. Instead of being governed by a board of directors, objectives can be agreed upon and completed through the community. And who better to run the Validator DAO than a group of validators who have their ear closest to delegators and other validators.   
  
In my opinion, the Harmony Foundation is setting up the Validator DAO to further onboard new validators and to get them up and running to elected status, and we as a council, need to think outside of the box on how to streamline the process to make sure we hit the goal of 1,000+ elected validators.  
  
  
 **2. The Validator DAO will be seeded with 4 million tokens from the Harmony Foundation. How would you choose to deploy those funds for the greatest impact on the Validator Community?**  
In order to successfully onboard many more validators, we need to correct the current bottleneck at hand-- education. Sure, it is easy for someone tech savvy to spin up a validator node within 20 minutes, but this is not feasible for someone that has never touched a command line.   
  
I think it would be beneficial to implement additional resources for a new validator, such as updated YouTube tutorials, guides, and 1-on-1 mentoring. This needs to extend to beyond initial setup and also needs to cover how to best get elected as well through marketing best practices.  
  
Furthermore, I would love to see an onboarding validator orientation. This could be as simple as a 1 hour zoom meeting hosted once per week where it covers the basics and additional resources that are available to validators.  
  
  
 **3.  How is the “Validator Community” different from the larger “Harmony Community”?**  
The Validator Community is essentially the backbone to the Harmony Community. We are a resource of information for not only delegators but also new validators as well. Validators that are growing their own brand and business are further growing the reach of the Harmony Community. Thus, as leaders it is important to onboard validators that act ethically and without malice.  
  
  
 **4. How will you address validators that consistently go beneath the lower bound to increase their rewards? Validator that go into the lower bound to try to increase their APY are pushing out smaller delegators and hurting our decentralization.**  
This can be resolved through further education. Going below the lower bound is risky with limited upside. By educating validators that this practice has detrimental consequences to further growing the harmony ecosystem, it could damage their business as well by putting themselves at risk of being pushed out of election.   
  
I would also love to see a “Validator Code of Ethics” implemented which would further help detour a validator from going into the lower bound. Benefits of following the code could help a validator with further marketing efforts within the community, and if the code is not followed, they would no longer receive said benefits-- thus creating additional consequences negating the reward.   
  
  
 **5. My question relates to the proposed candidates vigilance and stewardship. What do you believe the biggest threat is to the Harmony Protocol, and how would you use your role on the Council to safeguard against this threat?**  
Harmony Protocol is entering its growth stage, and just like any business, a few bad eggs can spoil the bunch. If there are validators out there for their own personal gain at the cost of harming delegators and other validators, this could ultimately tarnish the Harmony Community’s reputation.  
  
Additionally, we need to work on lowering the learning curve. Anyone should feel confident enough to spin up a validator node, and if they get stuck, have the resources to help them.  
  
Finally, marketing is a big chunk as well. We need to teach new validators how to ethically market their business, because ultimately, if we don’t have 1,000+ elected validators, we won’t have a strong enough decentralized backbone to carry the community forward.  
  
  
 **6. How are you going to add more value to the project?**  
I am not new when it comes to operating a new startup business. I understand the growing pains a new business owner feels when trying to catch the eye of the public and not having any success. Through strategic marketing and providing the best service possible, this doesn’t have to be such a tedious task. I feel I can benefit new validators in not only the technology side, but the marketing side as well, so becoming a validator can turn into a rather fruitful business which in turn will attract more people to decentralized finance and universal basic income.",2021-05-25 08:40:50

**Stats:** 37, wife: SAHM, Married 5 years, (4) kids under 7y/o. Six weeks in to MRP.

**Sidebar:** NMMNG, MMSLP, reading WISNIFG. I’ve been struggling with WISNIFG as I’ve found it dry and boring and used it as an excuse to not finish it. I will double down this week and commit to finishing it. And moving on to the next book.

**Lifting:** 6'2"", 170 pounds. Bench: 95lbs 5X5, OHP: 95 X3, have not deadlifted, squat, or BB row yet. Met with a trainer for an assessment last week. Going to meet with him again this week and work on implementing a workout routine that is structured around the bar. I decided this after lifting free weights and using the isolation machines for 3 months or so, and being unhappy with the results. My BF is low enough that I am starting to show abs and other muscles but I still look skinny. I want to add a bulkier look to my muscles and will explain this to the trainer to see what feedback I get.

**Diet:**The trainer advised me I was not eating nearly enough, especially not enough protein. I have made a serious effort to add an extra serving a protein to each meal and 1-2 extra boosts of 15-25g of protein throughout the day. I am limiting carbs to a piece of toast in the AM, bread sandwich for lunch, and rice or side of carb for dinner. I do not drink soda or alcohol or eat junk food other than peanut butter and fruit. I am going to work harder at the diet learning curve as this is all new to me.

**Style:** Doing ok. I’ve noticed some of my outfits, while objectively looking good, do not always make me feel my best. I am going to explore this more this week.

**Hygiene:** I have been looking at my teeth and thinking about whitening and getting my bottom row (crooked) fixed. I have a gap in my two front teeth but I like its natural look and don’t think I want to change that. I will make a dental appointment in the next few weeks to have this priced. 

**Social:** I made a serious effort to meet a friend I have not seen since last year. It went well but he invited his girlfriend to join after we ate. I was not happy as I would’ve preferred a boys night. As soon as she showed up they left. It made me sad. I am going to work on a plan for improving my social life this week in terms of new male friends. 

**finances:** I led my family astray a few years ago into bankruptcy. I take full ownership of this. Since then, I have worked hard to reduce consumer spending, pay off two late model vehicles (no car pymts), get my retirement savings on track, and reduced debt significantly to only student loan and mortgages. We are also saving for kids college which feels great. Our net worth is steadily rising since these moves and tracking the improvement has been a great source of pride for me. But I also recognize that it could all disappear in an instant and still have deep shame over leading my family to BR. Lately, however, I’ve been slacking in some areas of discretionary spending, eating out and buying frivolous things which has caused our monthly credit bill to go much higher than it should be. I made sure the budgeting software was accurate this week and will begin to monitor this closely in an effort to reduce our monthly discretionary spend by at least 25% if not more.

We also rented out our duplex (rental income) and moved in with my in laws late last year while we searched for a single family. We were blessed in that my FIL found a house FSBO a few months ago and a also agreed to finance until I could procure another mortgage in 1-3 years and buy him out. We have been renovating it ourselves with my FIL. However, being beholden to my FIL has caused some serious ego issues. He is an amazing man but I can’t help but feel I let my family down by not being able to secure our own home and living with my in laws. I will explore this ego issue this week and put it to bed. Whats done is done. 

**career:** I realized several weeks ago that at some point in my life I began following the career path I “thought” I should take instead of the one I genuinely wanted to. I took offers that fell into my lap instead of striving for offers or opportunities I wanted. That has led to significant career malaise. I have begun asking myself it it would be possible to branch out from what I am doing now but really strive for something more and what that would look like. I have also began mapping out what I value in a career (work/life balance, salary, culture, etc) in order to plan for my next move. I am going to set a goal of deciding on my next move either within the firm I am at or others opportunities by January.

**Marriage:** This has been a whirlwind past two weeks. After some early success using ideas from the two books and sidebar posts I read, I have spiraled out of control. Sex was very frequent but I noticed it felt as though she was motivated from fear of my anger from no sex or of us not getting along if she did not engage me sexually, instead of true desire. I attribute this to trying way too much too early when I lack even the most basic understanding of core MRP concepts. I will return this week to core principles/dread, 1-3 and focus hard on the bar (lift) and STFU. Way too many times I found myself explaining how I “felt” instead of realizing my mistakes and STFU, which sunk me each time. After my my early highs crashed and burned, I found myself truly angry and checked out the past few days, trying to avoid my wife entirely and lacking any sex drive. I will focus on returning got the sidebar in earnest and taking my time to digest the materials and STFU.

**Frame:** My frame has improved in that that I can see myself acting when I am doing it, I am truly aware of how I feel when I am doing things, and actively trying to slow down and stay in the moment. I still find myself reacting in stead of being proactive, and genuinely caring way too much what others think and pondering all of the “what ifs.” I am going to mediate more on IDNGAF and return to my MAP in an effort to refocus my frame work and overall goals. If it does not serve my plan, then why do I care? I also am recognizing so many things that I need to let go of. This has been liberating.

**Children:** One huge area of improvement I have noticed is with my children and the mood of the home. When I am calm, present, and proactive instead of reactive, thinking hard about how I treat my children, we flow as a family and the kids and all of us are visibly less stressed. Wife has even remarked how much less stressful mornings and evenings are when I am rising early to set the tone for the day and keeping a calm demeanor for all of us. If this were the only improvement in my life it would be worth it. I am going to focus on being the first one awake and last one down, staying calm, and not letting things undermine the family goals and morale. I am going to keep on the gas here but also continue to mediate on this as it is a huge motivator.",2021-05-26 10:07:04

Delicious_Context_53,"In a recession you see decreased economic productivity, company profits decrease, they lay off workers, who in turn spend less, leading to less economic productivity. The Fed is supposed to step in here by lowering interest rates, which stimulates lending, allowing companies to finance activity and in theory keep workers employed.

Since rates are at 0, the alternative is to directly stimulate spending by sending out stimulus checks. This requires political consensus. Therefore this will not happen. 

We will likely see negative interest rates, which the Fed can do directly and does not require political consensus. This will cause investors to move away from bonds even more, and toward assets like bitcoin. Probably some degree of yield curve control on the treasuries as well, which will weaken the dollar.

There may be punctuations throughout this process where investors pull liquidity and the price crashes, but on the whole I think the narrative for bitcoin gets stronger. As other fiat currencies collapse, citizens of those nations will turn to bitcoin for economic protection. We see this already in African and South American nations.",2021-05-26 11:14:14

broooooskii,"Central bankers around the world are mulling the future of their massive bond-buying programs in a post-pandemic world, knowing that with big balance sheets come big expectations.  
  
Featured in the June/July issue of Bloomberg Markets.Illustrator: Rachell Sumpter  
The Group of Seven developed economies piled on about $7 trillion in debt last year as they spent heavily to fight the pandemic and prop up their economies. Central banks ended up owning much of that new debt, according to Bloomberg Economics.  
  
Even as asset purchases continue, with hundreds of billions of dollars spent each month, officials at the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are among those figuring out how—or if—they can reduce asset piles that have been a mainstay of financial markets for more than a decade.  
  
The problem is that markets have come to expect central banks to use their buying power to smooth over any hint of trouble. Governments may be tempted to lean on monetary authorities to use it to keep borrowing costs low indefinitely. And activists now also call on monetary officials to use their firepower to fight inequality and even climate change. Those disparate expectations add to the unease fueled by economists who for years have warned about the long-term effects of quantitative easing.  
  
“The Fed balance sheet is going to be gigantic for a long time,” says Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman who’s now a Princeton professor. “That worries some people,” he says—but not Blinder himself.  
  
The size of the Fed balance sheet in coming years will largely be determined by Federal Open Market Committee decisions regarding asset purchases and reinvestment policies, the New York Federal Reserve Bank noted in a late May report. Yet the report projects that the balance sheet could rise by 2023 to $9 trillion, equivalent to 39% of gross domestic product. Under a range of scenarios, Fed assets could remain at that level through 2030 or drop as low as $6.6 trillion.    
  
QUANTITATIVE-EASING TOOLS have been a welcome boon to ­monetary institutions faced with policy rates already near or below zero. But they’ve also magnified the political profile of central banks, leaving them more exposed to entanglement in fiscal policy—or the perception that they could be.  
  
So-called fiscal dominance—in which central banks are prevented from acting on their inflation mandates for fear of harming the government’s finances—is the issue. It’s associated with a ­spectrum of concerns, ranging from the erosion of independence, with the possibility of monetary officials keeping policy too loose and unleashing inflation, to a regime change in which government borrowing is monetized, with central banks buying debt directly or agreeing to buy a certain amount.  
  
How far the situation has come is starkly visible in Europe. Where once the mere purchase of debt of euro-area nations on secondary markets unleashed accusations of illegal monetary financing, high-­ranking politicians in Italy and France have in recent months called for the bonds on the European Central Bank’s balance sheet to be canceled or turned into “perpetual” bonds that never get paid back.  
  
The idea that government debt has to be honored is coming under attack. “We’re headed toward this sort of Modern Monetary Theory regime where the debt and free money supposedly have no consequences,” says Charles Plosser, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, who’s now a fellow at the Hoover Institution. “What I worry about ultimately is the politicization of the central bank.”  
  
The concern is about a specific set of circumstances: With such a large balance sheet, a central bank such as the Bank of Japan, the Fed, or the ECB is the government’s buyer-in-chief. Indirectly, the monetary authority controls the government’s cost of borrowing. The current debates about so-called yield-curve control—buying that targets a specific yield at a given tenor—only underline this fact.  
  
But if inflation comes along, the central bank governor is in a pickle. Raise rates, and the government screams. Keep them low, and you prove that your independence—and credibility to fight inflation—has gone.  
  
The straightforward way to get out of this dilemma is to reduce the size of debt holdings as quickly as possible. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey hinted last year that he may favor aggressive shrinkage also because it could create more room to maneuver in a future emergency.  
  
But in 2013, after the U.S. had come out of the crisis sparked by the subprime meltdown, the Fed signaled an attempt to “taper” its own balance sheet, leading to an immediate spike in bond yields and global market turmoil. Central bankers are wary of doing the same again. Fed officials say there’s no need to discuss a change in the pace of bond-buying until much more progress has been made on their employment and inflation goals. Investors are laser-focused on when that moment might come.  
  
The lesson from the Bank of Japan, which has advanced further in the direction of fiscal dominance than its peers, seems to be that any attempt to wind down the debt holdings of today could take a generation or more. “The BOJ will have to do it very, very slowly, hoping no one will notice that’s what it is doing,” says Richard Koo, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo and a former adviser to Japanese prime ministers. “If they do it very carefully over, say, 20 to 30 years, they may be able to bring the balance sheet back to something normal.”  
  
Quantitative easing has been part of the monetary toolkit for so long now that the definition of “normal” has changed. Where once the Fed maintained a “lean” balance sheet just greater than the value of bank notes issued, there’s little chance of a return to that. There are various reasons why central bankers will want to retain at least some of their current holdings indefinitely, from preserving their ability to intervene to smooth market functioning to helping the conduct of monetary policy.  
  
To do so, central bankers may need to prove that they’re not captured by their finance ministries and that, when inflation returns, they can react. Vitor Constancio, ECB vice president until 2018, argues the fears about fiscal dominance are “wishful thinking” by market investors, a narrative that pressures the central bank to keep policy loose indefinitely.  
  
“When inflation normalizes in a consistent way, central banks will start reducing the size of their balance sheets,” Constancio says. “I have no doubt about that.”",2021-05-26 20:11:10

whyrat,"&gt; Not sure what whyrat thinks of this but boring_pencil the short and simple answer is that it does not matter, they both have the same effect. 

I think it maters based on the relative current balance between debt and tax revenue.  If debt is high and tax revenue low, it's ""better"" to finance through higher tax revenue.  If Tax revenue is high and debt is low it's ""better"" to finance new spending through debt.

Also, the business cycle matters. Raising taxes during a recession period has different growth implications than during an expansion period.

Remember it's a trade-off. The marginal costs depend on the level.  Maybe it's best to think of it in the same terms with the isoquant curve: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/isoquantcurve.asp

When one form of financing spending is more prevalent than the other, the marginal cost/benefit shifts in favor of the method that's less represented. The answer for which is more efficient depends on where you currently are on the curve.",2021-05-26 23:38:45

Econophysicist1,"Define too good to be true. If an algo does like 1000x in a year probably you have some look forward leak. What you should always do is the following. Get a table of all your trades and the prices the use this table to do the calculation of your cumulative growth and compare it with the cumulative growth curve your backtest produces. If the 2 match, then check one by one the prices for these stocks during that day using independent data sources (like yahoo finance or google charts). It is often one of the best ways to catch some error.   
Another thing to try is to change your parameters slowly and see how your cumulative curve changes. If the final gain changes slowly relative to the parameter change then probably you don't have an error but if you lose immediately alpha probably you do.

An MHA provides a large alumni network in healthcare specifically. An MBA has people in all industries so your ties to healthcare might be weaker. I’m at VCU and they have fellowship/residencies ties all over which is a huge advantage in looking for those.

stratagizer,"Let me start by saying that I agree 100% that trickle down economics do not work. I studied economics. In particular, I spent a lot of time trying to justify my very conservative upbringing in the face of the reality.

That said, saying ""it's just common sense"", is either disingenuous, short-sighted, or misinformed.

Especially in the 70s and 80s, there was serious economic literature showing that cutting taxes and getting the government out of the way of economic activity was the way to go. The most common one is the now debunked Laffer Curve. There's a lot more to it, but at its heart the concept is that if the government takes less money from every transaction, there will be more transactions occurring in the marketplace so in the long-run the government will collect MORE revenue. Its predicated on the assumption that the free market is better at allocating resources than government. This is an entire debate that, IMHO, does not have a solved answer.

Now, to your other point, ""we'll if we let this rich guy keep this extra $1M, why would be spend it?"" The whole system of capitalism is based on the idea that everyone is going to try and make the most return on their money that they can. This is basic human behavior. Unless he keeps it under his mattress, it IS going to be used. Even if he puts it in his bank account, great! The bank has an extra $1M in assets that it can use to loan out to start/build businesses. This will in turn create jobs that will create a feedback loop of wealth creation. And based on the historical evidence and research of the time, it made sense. The best returns for your money was to invest in Capital, creating jobs, kicking off the wealth cycle.

Here is where my personal research shows the problem. Yes, historically that was the best return for your money. But around the 80s is when we start to see widespread use of some of the more complex financial tools we have now (The Big Short has a couple good explanations). Now, it was starting to become better to invest you money in these schemes. Now the feedback loops are within financial and investing circles, not the normal banking system. Money makes money based on money not tangible items. So instead of pushing money down it all stays within the high finance world. This is what we are seeing at a Macro-level with the rich getting richer faster the richer you are.",2021-05-29 00:36:29

I did gather that you and others were brave enough to adopt very early as far as ETH (and others I assume). Buy and HODL I've come along way with.

My question (rant really) was more about the finance concepts that to me, are difficult to grasp regardless of the base money, whether fiat or crypto.

You mention LedgerX - Are you referring to the hardware wallet? I can't imagine otherwise but I use a Nano X as well but I'm unaware of anything regarding SEC regulation and fully insured? Could you elaborate on this?

Celsius - I've been trying to get A Cel , let alone Celcius as a platform to work for me but after completing KYC and the entire verification process i was informed that it's not available to use in the US.  I'm aware of methods available to handle the general "" no US "" aspect of certain platforms but not when KYC is in use.  So I can't do anything with Celcius. Did I miss anything? 

- General advanced concepts like OTM calls and other options, leverage, etc. I get that these methods are universal and need to be studied one way or another but I don't have these options offered to me on the exchanges I use (unfort I'm forced to use only Coinbase Pro and Gemini Trader. No others "" technically "" work where I live) I'm still curious where one would get the options for options on crypto.

Finally, I do get that it takes money to make money unless you have either time or lots of startup capital on your side. I'm not a moonshot hunting noob, but I wasn't early either. I have my stack but a mouse could easily see over it. Unless I'm missing something it seems pointless to do anything but buy more when I can and HODL until the stack is stackable. Because even if I could get a cumulative 50% return in a year, a few grand becomes just a bit more in a year.  Law of large numbers doesn't apply to me unfortunately.  
I love the compound interest curve, but from my calculations it seems that it really only begins to deviate from linear growth after about 10 years. And really takes off after 20.  Time which I do not have. 

I guess the question is, is DeFi and financial wizardry worth it under 10k or should my focus be just stacking and holding until decimals become as valuable as whole numbers are today?

ShaughnDBL,"That's *exactly* what I think happened.

If you look at the big banks' activity in the past 5 months they've been shrinking their businesses and/or putting on the biggest bond sales in the history of finance. One after the other. Hedge funds have been rupturing. This tells me they're hungry for cold cash. They're running the repo market into the red already, on their way to completely inverting the yield curve, so they're looking elsewhere. Cripped-0 doesn't require any reporting, so it's the perfect place for their preferred, sheisty reindeer games and parlor tricks in terms of scraping together a couple bucks on the sly.

In other words, they've shown their motivation for cash, there's no one else as motivated or capable to do what's happened to cripped-0, and we know they're overleveraged in many of their positions without the cash on hand to cover them as required by the new audit rules.

So, yeah. You hit the nail on the head.",2021-05-30 03:07:46

k2thesawa,"Not necessarily. Curve finance pairs USDC USDT DAI and some other USD stables together. The reward isn't as high as it used to be but you can still get decent APR. I did some pairings of BSC BUSD to ETH BUSD on harmony blockchain for some decent rewards. There are options on BSC to pair stables together too. Which if you do that, you don't have to worry about impermanent loss. 1 USD = 1 USD",2021-05-30 04:23:00
t00mietum,"It's not a matter of a bad actor(s) ""killing"" bitcoin. At least, not in my bet-upon scenario. It's simply a matter of it dying in total, utter, whimpering archaic irrelevancy. Mining farms amortizing out of mining (or transitioning to other distributed GPU work that isn't crypto-related - as I am myself). ""Market cap"" slowly withering. People just, you know...moving on. As we tend to do. (While it could be, I seriously doubt it would be a sudden, catastrophic crash that brings down the rest of crypto and the stock market too.)

People had millions invested in Prodigy and CompuServe. Then the internet came (technically had already been there), and yet those services kept going strong. But slowly, eventually they became irrelevant. Investors looked elsewhere. They couldn't evolve. *Massive* sums of capital evaporated, but the economy not only kept going, but grew with the potential of the superior replacement.

The same happened, slowly, with steam-powered locomotives and shipping, which dominated world commerce.

The point is not that things change and old tech dies. It's that when the new tech comes along that eventually kills the old, few recognize it for what it is initially. (In part because that's not always even possible.) But like Roger's bell curve, some are left defending the undefendable long after it's obvious, for no good reason. Is that you? (I don't know. Maybe? Maybe not. I'm not the expert - or rather the oracle - to say.)

Crypocurrency represents the quickening of the tech lifecycle on steroids, but in a space we sometimes think of as slow and conservative. (Finance and investing.) That creates massive social and individual cognitive dissonance. Bitcoin was a seismic tech revolution to put it mildly. But is now a coughing, wheezing, sputtering Model T with no intrinsic worth or practical value - compared to even just LTC, XMR, or ETH - other than people saying it's ""digital gold"" with self-satisfaction, as if that meant anything whatsoever.

But again, that's just my opinion. My long-term bet. I'm bach'in it this weekend and for some reason find this a fun thing to do with my rare night off :-D. I won't change your mind. If anything I'm just seeing if I can argue myself out of a position. This is all just pointless mental masturbation.

Either way, this will be my last cycle in BTC. I could *easily* miss more bull runs and bear opportunities. For sure. But I'd rather invest that brainpower investing in the future of crypto, not the past.

(But if bitcoin does wind up *massively* keeping up, ship of theseus style - eventually becoming something utterly different but with the same name and - like ETH 2.0, remembering the old coins and tx history on a shard - then of course I'd consider getting back in. Lose the original value of my current investment? Yes. That's the nature of ""opportunity cost"", and wouldn't necessarily be a net loss, portfolio-wise.)

Just do me this small favor. When The Flippening happens, think to yourself, ""Maybe that tummy guy or whatever, was on to something."" And pop a cold one in my honor.",2021-05-30 14:44:06
sharist_DIY_bio,"No problem, that was kind of you. I don't know anything about ElevateBio. That doesn't mean it is not a good company. My specific knowledge of Gingko comes from specific interactions with the Gingko ecosystem through George Church, MIT, MIT's MediaLab, I-Gem, and BioBricks from their early days. My personal goals and volunteer time, includes traveling to developing nations to share this technology with young people so they do not get left behind and some can bring it back to change the future of their societies. I'm all about democratic access to this technology for the good of all creatures and humans. It is world changing and should be shared. I am also new to investing, just started in October. I can explain some things, but my learning curve in finance has been high. I am only really invested in SPACs. I also invest in mining from time to time, Cobalt and Uranium. But, all my retirement is tied up in a government system that I have no control over, there is a basket of funds managed by contractors with my primary funds. So, I play with my small bit that I have grown since October in SPAC land. I like it because I learn about new things. I have high risk tolerance and favor new technology. I didn't know what Units, Warrants, TAM, EBITDA, Revenue multiples, PIPE, SEC filings, etc. were until maybe February or March. So keep that in mind. But I do know Ginkgo very well. I trust them as stewards of this technology to use it for the common good and stop bad actors. Other folks asked me to look into ZY and Amy so I did that. I'll try to check out your ElevateBio, when I get some free exploration time. Always happy to learn and share. Cheers. Thanks again for your polite kindness.",2021-05-30 22:08:28
