RadiantCellar,"There is no way that Serbia or Venezuela or any of the other 2nd world shitholes you listed ever had the geopolitical power to get off the fiat system without some sort of under-handed sanctions bringing them to heel. This is why your examples are bogus under the surface. True fiat is the petrodollar. All the other currencies are subordinate in differing degrees. It is what allows the US to export its inflation, countries must pay for oil with dollars, driving the demand for dollars up.

Central banking is a global force with the US as its primary hegemon and enforcer, and there are globalist financial organizations that represent them, like the IMF. Intelligence agencies like the CIA, FBI, and M\*ssad assist them. If you cannot be convinced that powerful connected people will seek to preserve and expand their system of influence as a rule, there's simply no way we can have an intelligent discussion. See all the Middle East countries (ex. Iraq) that did not have a central bank before 2001 and now do. Or perhaps you think private central banks are an unmitigated improvement to a country?

I did not intend to be semantic; it really does not matter. Living memory is an arbitrary limitation you asked of me. We study history for a reason; there are reasons beyond your hyper-specialized understanding of finance and silver mine logistics. Civilizations follow trends, both in their rise and fall. The trends are all negative here. Speculating in silver is ultimately hedging against fiat collapse up to the total collapse of civilization and the start of another one.

Anyway, you got me all worked up by being a pretentious cunt to that guy who suggested the next crash might be more comprehensive and damaging just off of animal instinct, hence the bell curve midwit meme.  

Also, ""You have to reference outside of living memory for this statement to hold true, which means it isn't true or actionable."" This is a completely unfounded argument that you use to debunk my ENTIRE argument from the start. YOUR ARGUMENTS were all based on a false premise.

Here's me mimicking your rhetoric, (the unfounded and sophistic denigration (""word-salad"") of your counter-arguments would be in my next response, which isn't coming): You're an intellectually dishonest person with unresolved mental illness issues and a superiority complex and most likely a feeble body. You feel an urgent need to come on here and instead of teaching people the right way because you love your fellow man, you actively berate them for purchasing inflation and downturn resistant assets and call them ""peons,"" flexing your ultimately limited understanding of the world through the lens of high finance and your expertise in silver mining. Not to mention combining dishonest and hypocritical rhetoric. Many of the people here do not have a finance background and are just trying to secure their meager futures. It sounds like you're already secure, so stop shitting on everybody. It's frankly embarrassing that you're already high and mighty with what I assume is sub 8 figures.

[Here's the problem OP: most, if not all of your stocks are garbage.  Most people here are telling you just to hold, don't panic yada yada yada because they're invested in good companies that move slower but actually make money and are established, and will almost always recover after a price drop. They either don't know or don't care what it's like to buy crap companies and lose a shitton on them.   The stocks you own range from mid-cap to microcap which makes them much more risky as investments and you NEED to know what you're doing when you buy them. Don't just buy them and hope they go up unless you understand that you are gambling. Investing is KNOWING what you're buying and why you're buying it. You need a plan for when the stock goes up and goes down. Otherwise you end up in this situation where you're losing large amounts of money and asking random people on the internet for advice.  As for what to do now: decide what you can jettison and what you really believe in. You said you had faith in BLNK and CHPT - but can you explain why you believe in them? I personally only like CHPT out of everything you own, but I'm just one guy, and I haven't researched AQB, EVGO, UK and STAF. BLNK is not a great company but it's surprisingly resilient compared to some of the other stocks that melted up over the winter. You also need to consider larger factors weighing on the market itself - inflation and what it means for companies like yours. Generally, it's not expected that the average speculative growth stock will do well in a hot economy, but there are exceptions for truely exceptional companies.](/r/stocks/comments/pxyrnh/wtf_is_going_on_with_the_market/hequtk9/)

Grayscale® Digital Large Cap Fund and Grayscale® DeFi Fund Announce Quarterly Rebalancing of Funds  
Smart contract platform Solana and decentralized exchange Uniswap have been added to the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund  
October 01, 2021 17:57 ET | Source: Grayscale Investments  
  
...  
New York, Oct. 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grayscale Investments®, the world’s largest digital currency asset manager, and manager of both Grayscale® Digital Large Cap Fund (OTCQX: GDLC) (the Digital Large Cap Fund) and Grayscale® DeFi Fund (the DeFi Fund), today announced the updated Fund Component weightings for each product in connection with their respective quarterly reviews.   
  
In accordance with the Digital Large Cap Fund’s construction criteria, Grayscale has adjusted the Digital Large Cap Fund’s portfolio by selling certain amounts of the existing Fund Components in proportion to their respective weightings and using the cash proceeds to purchase Solana (SOL) and Uniswap (UNI). This announcement follows the July 2021 news that Grayscale adjusted the Digital Large Cap Fund’s portfolio and purchased Cardano (ADA), and is the first time Solana (SOL) will be included in a Grayscale investment vehicle.   
  
Solana  
  
SOL is the native token of the Solana network, a smart contract platform first conceived by Anatoly Yakovenko in a 2017 whitepaper. Like the Ethereum network, the Solana network is one of a number of projects intended to expand blockchain use beyond just a peer-to-peer money system. The Solana protocol introduced the Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism as an alternative to pure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains like Ethereum. PoH is intended to provide a transaction processing speed and capacity advantage over traditional PoW and PoS networks, which rely on sequential production of blocks and can lead to delays caused by validator confirmations.   
  
Uniswap  
  
UNI is the native token of the Uniswap network, a decentralized exchange originally conceived in 2016 by Vitalek Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, and later developed in 2018 by Hayden Adams and Uniswap Labs. Uniswap enables trading of digital assets without a central order book by aggregating digital asset trading pairs using smart contracts. On Uniswap, users exchange digital assets with one another by paying a transaction fee to independent market makers called liquidity providers. Holders of UNI have the ability to propose and vote on improvement proposals to adjust features of the Uniswap network.   
  
At the end of the day on October 1, 2021, the Digital Large Cap Fund’s Fund Components were a basket of the following assets and weightings.  
  
Bitcoin (BTC), 62.19%  
Ethereum (ETH), 26.08%  
Cardano (ADA), 5.11%  
Solana (SOL), 3.24%  
Uniswap (UNI), 1.06%  
Chainlink (LINK), 0.82%  
Litecoin (LTC), 0.77%  
Bitcoin Cash (BCH), 0.73%  
No new tokens were added or removed from the DeFi Fund. At the end of the day on October 1, 2021, the DeFi Fund’s Fund Components were a basket of the following assets and weightings.  
  
Uniswap (UNI), 45.20%  
Aave (AAVE), 14.11%  
MakerDAO (MKR), 7.84%  
SushiSwap (SUSHI), 7.18%  
Compound (COMP), 6.73%  
Synthetix (SNX), 6.29%  
Yearn Finance (YFI), 3.92%  
Curve (CRV), 3.53%  
Bancor Network Token (BNT), 3.04%  
UMA Protocol (UMA), 2.16%  
Neither the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund nor the Grayscale DeFi Fund generate any income, and both regularly distribute Fund Components to pay for ongoing expenses. Therefore, the amount of Fund Components represented by shares of each fund gradually decreases over time.

About Grayscale® Digital Large Cap Fund  
Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund enables investors to gain exposure to a market-cap weighted portfolio of large-cap digital currencies through a singular investment vehicle without the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping digital currencies directly. Through a rules-based portfolio construction methodology derived from the CoinDesk Large Cap Index, the Digital Large Cap Fund targets coverage of the upper 70% of the digital currency market and is re-evaluated each quarter; however, the weightings of each Fund Component change daily and are published around 4:00 p.m. NY-time.\*  Additional information on the Index methodology can be found at: https://tradeblock.com/markets/dlcx.  
  
The Digital Large Cap Fund's investment objective is for its Shares to reflect the value of Fund Components held by the Digital Large Cap Fund, less its expenses and other liabilities. To date, the Digital Large Cap Fund has not met its investment objective and the Shares quoted on OTCQX have not reflected the value of Fund Components held by the Digital Large Cap Fund, less the Digital Large Cap Fund's expenses and other liabilities, but instead have traded at both premiums and discounts to such value, with variations that have at time been substantial.  
  
The Digital Large Cap Fund is an investment vehicle with Shares titled in the investor’s name, providing a familiar structure for financial and tax advisors and easy transferability to beneficiaries under estate laws. Additionally, Shares are eligible to be held in certain IRA, Roth IRA, and other brokerage and investor accounts.  
  
About Grayscale® DeFi Fund  
Grayscale Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Fund holds digital assets that make up the CoinDesk DeFi Index. These digital assets are drawn from the universe of investable digital assets native to decentralized finance or DeFi. The Index methodology includes liquid DeFi assets on a market cap-weighted basis and is re-evaluated each quarter; however, the weightings of each Fund Component change daily and are published around 4:00 p.m. NY-time.\* Additional information on the Index methodology can be found at https://tradeblock.com/markets/dfx/.  
  
Grayscale intends to attempt to have shares of this new product quoted on a secondary market. However, there is no guarantee this will be successful. Although the shares of certain products have been approved for trading on a secondary market, investors in this new product should not assume that the shares will ever obtain such an approval due to a variety of factors, including questions regulators such as the SEC, FINRA or other regulatory bodies may have regarding the product. As a result, shareholders of this product should be prepared to bear the risk of investment in the shares indefinitely.  
  
 \*The compositions of the Digital Large Cap Fund and the DeFi Fund are evaluated on a quarterly basis to remove existing Fund Components or to include new Fund Components in their portfolios, in accordance with the Construction Criteria established by Grayscale or the Index Provider, as applicable.  
  
About Grayscale Investments®    
Founded in 2013, Grayscale Investments is the world’s largest digital currency asset manager, with more than $41.5B in assets under management as of October 1, 2021.

chairfairy,"I'm not suggesting every Excel user should use version control, but that it's worth considering if you find yourself struggling through clumsy ways to track new file revisions. It's a big enough learning curve that most of us don't want to jump into VCS unless there's good reason, but once you get over the initial hump it can be really trivial to use, especially if you're not working with a large team editing all the same files at the same time. (And even with VCS it's often critical to coordinate with your teammates who works on each set of files at any given time - it's not a magic wand.)

Where Excel fits in the your organization depends a whole lot on the organization. It's not only finance / business folks using it - engineering and manufacturing also rely on it heavily. We're often flying be the seat of our pants with data, using Excel to prove out the math for a new process or check results when we don't have a real system to run the test. It's very much *not* taking in clean, well defined data.

VCS does bring a lot to the table when you have a multi-developer team, but it's a bit of a narrow view to say it applies only to that scope. My whole team of programmers is 3 people and we mostly work on projects individually, but our git repository is indispensable. On top of rev tracking, it lets us share a common code base and be able to keep each of our copies of a given file in sync.

As an individual developer, version control lets me work on a big set of new features for one project without changing the files that are released to production. Then if the production version needs a small bug fix, I can easily revert to that, make and release the bug fix, then jump back to where I was making changes. ""...v2"" / ""v3"" / etc. doesn't let you control which version is the one everyone should be using.

(And super minor point, but agile and scrum are project management paradigms, not any type of version control - it's simply about how you organize and plan your work. They're popularized in the field programming, but are applicable to literally any project no matter they size of the team.)",2021-10-02 19:27:27
samdachemist,"For me I try to keep $$$ off centralized exchanges just because if you're in the US the government could theoretically freeze that crypto.  Even if you're not in the US but the exchange is you could be SOL if they turn against it.  

A couple things I look at for analyzing protocols for safety is age, total value locked and if there have been any audits.  Curve is a decentralized exchange that has high TVL and has been around for over a year.  They specialize in pools of ""like"" tokens to minimize impermanent loss, which is a problem for other exchanges especially stable-crypto pair and new tokens that could be rug pulls.    

So when I was saying borrow a stable and provide it to curve its for people to exchange Dai/USDC/USDT.  Curve charges \~0.05% on all transactions which is distributed proportionally to all people with stable coins locked into the protocol.  Beyond that you can earn ""extra"" on top in the form of CRV tokens which give voting rights over the CRV protocol.  

There's currently kind of a cold war going on between secondary protocols over curve in that both yEARN finance and Convex finance are trying to secure a larger supply of CRV tokens by offering additional rewards to people for locking their CRV tokens into the respective protocols in order to have voting power to control the Curve protocol.  

This is important because of the amount of volume that the Curve protocol does.  So I think Curve is very safe and I think that they have a lot of levers to generate more $$$ which should theoretically flow to the CRV token holders.  I provide liquidty to curve in order to get exposure to it (instead of a stable coin) by earning rewards in curve.  

Curve is probably the safest exchange you can provide liquidity on.  You could make the argument for Uniswap or Sushiswap as well, and I really like SUSHI but UNI not so much (because of centralization).  Convex just multiplies rewards for CRV.  Sorry if this runs on or if i didn't answer your questions, we can take this to DM as well if you want.",2021-10-02 21:17:21

jbrev01,"In r/defi you can find some good defi for beginners tutorials and information.

My only advice is to stay away from projects with a low TVL (total value locked). Defi is all transparent so you can search for the projects with the highest TVL. Those will be popular known projects like Uniswap, Sushiswap, Aave, Curve, Quickswap. And stay away from liquidity pools or lending with unknown coins and tokens.

Defi is an anomaly that probably won't last forever with the returns we're currently seeing. Take advantage while you can because when crypto and defi go mainstream in finance, we won't be seeing the kinds of returns we have right now.

Best place to get started now is Polygon network, an Ethereum side chain. Fees are really low ($0.0001) and has all the same big projects as ETH. There isn't much available yet on SmartBCH, and no big stablecoins or large tokens other than BCH to trade with or provide liquidity currently.

Also, use Metamask with a hardware wallet. I've seen way too many people have their crypto stolen by just using metamask and browser wallets alone.

Basically in defi, you lock your crypto into smart contracts as a liquidity provider. For example ETH and USDC. People use a decentralized site like Quickswap to trade their ETH for USDC or vice versa. That trade happens because of people proving liquidity by locking their crypto in the smart contact. And those liquidity providers get paid trading fees when the trade takes place.

There's also lending/borrowing. A defi loan, people can put their own crypto up as collateral and take out a loan, like a stablecoin. No banks involved, no paperwork or KYC verification, no loan qualification, etc.

If you look at the stock market like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, those are centralized companies that issue stock certificates to people, shares in publicly traded companies. That centralized company handles everything, so there's trust involved. In defi, a company could create their own tokens and issue those as stock shares. Everything is transparent on the blockchain, so there's no trust required, no centralized authority who has control over everything. In the future, defi could also handle things like property ownership. Who owns what property. And for an investment property, who owns what percentage of a property and so who gets paid what percentage of rental income. When you look at things like this, it's becomes obvious how much potential there is in defi - decentralized finance. And the fact that most of the defi stuff happening right now is on the ETH blockchain, even SmartBCH is an ETH side chain. Not to be an ETH shill, but you can see how and why ETH will most likely be the first cryptocurrency to take over Bitcoin Core BTC which has absolutely no use-value. Can't use it to spend easily and cheaply, can't move it easily. All they have is their illogical store of value narrative, and the hopes of a bunch of gambling speculators to get rich quick who have no idea that in order to have a store of value, it must first be a medium of exchange.

lenkellui,"As someone who works in energy finance, I can provide a bit deeper insight on this topic.

Energy is a bit of a unique market for a couple of reasons: geographic limitations and supply diversity. In energy we have something called the [dispatch curve](https://www.powerengineeringint.com/content/dam/pei/print-articles/2016/07/1608pei_22.jpg), which basically shows how much energy demand is required for an energy producer to ""turn on"" in a given region. There's many different types of energy with various costs. Some forms like nuclear are rather slow (and expensive) to turn on and off and may remain operational even its at a loss for short periods of time. Additionally, it's extremely inefficient to carry energy over long distances, so markets are isolated to the suppliers and offtakers within a region no larger than a couple of states/countries. Within these markets, there are nodes (centralized connections) and hubs (locations with many offtakers) in the network that all have unique market prices. Of course this stuff is just based on variable cost of production--economics 101 type stuff. 

There's more nuance to this than I'm letting on here, but the long flat portion of the curve is generally the ""spot price"" of energy--and after including overhead and government subsidy--the price passed onto consumers in the market. Here in the states, natural gas is the dominant source of energy in most markets, so while removing some cheaper suppliers of energy may move the spot price a bit, it would require a massive upheavel of suppliers to drastically move the needle. I'm not too familiar with what Woitrin is referencing, but the term ""phase out"" suggests that the process is deliberately slow. It is also very common for suppliers and offtakers to enter purchasing contracts (PPAs &amp; VPPAs) that entirely avoid the market price. These contracts can last up to 15 years and essentially tether the price of energy to around the contract strike for an offtaker. 

TL;DR: All this is to say that the energy market is by design price inelastic, and the claim that phasing out of nuclear power will not cause the consumer price of energy to explode is probably more correct than it is wrong.",2021-10-05 04:05:48

""Nobody Really Knows How the Economy Works. A Fed Paper Is the Latest Sign.  
Many experts are rethinking longstanding core ideas, including the importance of  
inflation expectations.  
Hitch-hiking during the gas shortage in Beaverton, Ore., in 1973.  
By Neil Irwin Oct. 1, 2021

  
It has long been a central tenet of mainstream economic theory that public fears of inflation tend to be self-fulfilling. Now though, a cheeky and even gleeful takedown of  
this idea has emerged from an unlikely source, a senior adviser at the Federal Reserve named Jeremy B. Rudd. His 27-page paper, published as part of the Fed’s Finance and  
Economics Discussion Series, has become what passes for a viral sensation among economists.

  
The paper disputes the idea that people’s expectations for future inflation matter much for the level of inflation experienced today. That is especially important right now, in trying to figure out whether the current inflation surge is temporary or not. But the Rudd paper is part of something bigger still. It reflects a broader rethinking of core ideas about how the  
economy works and how policymakers, especially at central banks, try to manage things. This shift has also included debates about the relationship between unemployment and inflation, how deficit spending affects the economy, and much more. In effect, many of the key ideas underlying economic policy during the Great Moderation — the period of relatively steady growth and low inflation from the mid-1980s to 2007 that also seems to be a high-water mark for economists’ overconfidence — increasingly look to be at best incomplete, and at worst wrong. It is vivid evidence that macroeconomics, despite the thousands of highly intelligent people over centuries who have tried to figure it out, remains, to an uncomfortable degree, a black box. The ways that millions of people bounce off one another — buying and selling, lending and borrowing, intersecting with governments and central banks and businesses and everything else around us — amount to a system so complex that no human fully comprehends it.  


“Macroeconomics behaves like we’re doing physics after the quantum revolution, that we really understand at a fundamental level the forces around us,” said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an  
interview. “We’re really at the level of Galileo and Copernicus,” just figuring out the basics of how the universe works.  
“It requires more humility and acceptance that not everything fits into one model yet,” he said. Or put less politely, as Mr. Rudd writes in the first sentence of his paper, “Mainstream economics is replete with ideas that ‘everyone knows’ to be true, but that are actually  
arrant nonsense.” One reason for this, he posits: “The economy is a complicated system that is inherently difficult to understand, so propositions like these” — the arrant nonsense in question — “are all that saves us from intellectual nihilism.” And from that starting point, a staff economist at the world’s most powerful central bank went on to say, in effect,  
that his own employer has been focused on the wrong things for the last few decades.  
Importers were worried about the effect of the 10 percent duty imposed by President Nixon on foreign-made items as part of his new economic “game plan” to halt inflation.

  
Mainstream policymakers, very much including Mr. Rudd’s bosses at the Fed, believe that inflation is, in large part, self-fulfilling — that what people expect future inflation to look  
like has an ability to shape how much prices rise in the near term. In the common telling, the Great Inflation of the 1970s got going because people came to believe inflation would keep spiraling. The surge in gasoline prices wasn’t simply a frustrating development, but a harbinger of things to come, so people needed to demand higher raises, and businesses could feel confident charging higher prices for most everything. In this story, the great achievement of the Fed in the early 1980s was to break this cycle by re-establishing credibility that it would not allow sustained high inflation (though at the cost of a severe recession). That is why today’s discussions over the inflation outlook often spend a lot of time focusing on things like what bond prices suggest inflation will be five or 10 years from now, or how people answer survey questions about what they expect. Mr. Rudd argues that there is no solid evidence that the conventional story of the 1970s describes the real mechanism through which inflation takes place. He says there’s a simpler explanation consistent with the data: that businesses and workers arrive at prices and wages based on the conditions they’ve experienced in the recent past, not some abstract future forecast.  


For example, when inflation has been low in the recent past, workers might not demand raises as they would in a world where inflation was high; after all, their existing paychecks go pretty much as far as they used to. You don’t need some theory involving inflation expectations to get there. Some economists who are sympathetic to the idea that central bankers have overly fetishized precise measurements of inflation expectations aren’t ready to fully dismiss the idea. For example, Mr. Posen, a former Bank of England policymaker, says there remains a simple and hard-to-dispute idea about inflation expectations supported by lots of history: 

  that if people distrust a country’s monetary system, inflation shocks can spiral upward. Economic policy credibility matters. But that isn’t the same as assuming that some survey or bond market measure of what will happen to inflation in the distant future is particularly  
meaningful for forecasting the near future. “It has been a noble lie that has become a  
critical part of the catechism of global monetary policy, that long-term inflation expectations are not just interesting but are a decisive determinant of real-time inflation,” said Paul McCulley, a former Pimco chief economist, commenting on Mr. Rudd’s paper.

  
This isn’t the only way in which basic precepts underlying economic policy are shifting beneath economists’ feet. Particularly prominently, for years central bankers believed there was a tight relationship between the unemployment rate and inflation, known as the Phillips Curve. Over the course of the 2000s, though, that relationship appeared to weaken  
and become a less reliable guideline for how to set policy. Similarly, interest rates and inflation fell worldwide, for reasons that scholars are still trying to understand fully. That implied a lower “neutral interest rate,” or the rate that neither stimulates nor slows the economy, than was widely believed to be the case as recently as the mid-2010s. In many ways, the Fed’s policies just before the pandemic were aimed at incorporating those lessons and embracing sustained lower interest rates — and the possibility of lower  
unemployment — than many in the mainstream thought reasonable a few years earlier.

  
In the realm of fiscal policy, some conventional wisdom has also been upended in the last few years. It was thought that large government debt issuance would risk causing a spike in interest rates and crowd out private sector investment. But in that period, huge budget deficits have been paired with low interest rates and abundant credit for businesses. All of this makes it a challenging time for central bankers and other shapers of policy. “If you’re a  
policymaker and you don’t have robust confidence in the parameters of the game you are managing, it makes your job a whole lot more difficult,” Mr. McCulley said. But if you are in charge of making economic policy that affects the lives of millions, you can’t simply shrug your shoulders and say, “We don’t know how the world works, so what are we supposed to do?” You look at the evidence available, and make the best judgment you can. And then, if you think it turns out you were wrong about something, publish a sassy paper to try to get it right.""",2021-10-05 05:00:02

SlyTrout,"Without additional details on your situation, I can give you some good thumb rules. The most important thing is to get something that is safe and reliable. If it is possible to do that and stick to the thumb rules, do it. If not, try to get as close as you can to them.

1. Put at least 20% down.
2. Finance for 36 months or less.
3. Don't let the monthly payment exceed 8% of your monthly gross income.
4. Don't let the monthly payment exceed your monthly retirement savings.

The first two keep you ahead of the depreciation curve. Many people have ended up in financial trouble because their car was either totalled in an accident or had a major mechanical problem and they owed more than it was worth. A large down payment and short loan make it highly likely you will always have positive equity, even with models with higher than average depreciation. If you get a used car, which I strongly recommend for your situation, you have some wiggle room here. The thumb rules are for new cars and based on the significant depreciation that happens in the first fre years. Look up the value and expected depreciation for cars you are considering and come up with a plan to maintain positive equity and pay it off in a reasonable amount of time.

The last two look after your balance sheet. In general, the more you spend on a car the more your net worth is going to take a hit due to depreciation. Keeping the monthly payment to a small percentage of your income limits the price of the car you buy and therefore the depreciation loss you take. It also prevents the car payment from being a burden on your monthly budget.

jaytilala27,"Interest rates are calculated on various risk metrics and demand and supply of loans and invested capital. Just like how it was done 50 years ago, before federal govt. and ECB, and Japan decided to indirectly control borrowing rates through bank rates and repo rates. 

Let's say that supply of capital is $100M and demand for loans is also $100M, and the risk metrics decides that interest on loans is 6% and investors will get 5%. Now, imagine, demand for loan increases from $100M to $200M, this would trigger in risk metrics to charge more rates on loan, let's say 10% and give 9% to investors. If investors gets 9% in return, that would mean more people would provide capital and slowly the demand and supply will come closer to equilibrium.

Now, let's say invested capital in $200M and loan demand is only $100M, this means borrowers would pay less interests as supply is high, and investors would get less returns. This would encourage more borrowing since rates are low. 

Also, Defi allows fixed rate loans and variable rate loans as well, so investors and borrowers can choose which one they want.

Talking about yield curve, that's more of a concept of traditional finance because we have some specific time periods for bonds, like 1 month, 3 months, 10 years, and so on. However, in Defi, you can take a loan for 1 year, or 1 month, or 10 days, or 11 days, or even 10 hours. You can still draw a yield curve, but it would be no good because every individual and institution can take out loans for however long they want. 

Also, You will be able to  issue the traditional bonds on Cardano as well, you can use those to make yield curves and maybe connect oracles to them to figure out interest rates in Defi.",2021-10-06 12:40:10
sneakpeek_bot,"&gt; # Mothership Explains: Does S'pore really have 'one of the most Covid-naive populations in the world'?

&gt; At the recent Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) press conference on Oct. 2, finance minister and MTF co-chair Lawrence Wong called Singapore's population ""one of the most Covid-naive populations in the world"".

&gt; Wong said this in his opening remarks at the press conference, while giving an update on the overall Covid-19 situation in Singapore.

&gt; He mentioned that particular phrase while explaining that Singapore's overall strategy to reopening — geared toward living with Covid-19 as an endemic disease, rather than trying to eliminate it altogether — has not changed.

&gt; He explained that new restrictions were put in place as part of what the MTF has called the ""stabilisation phase"", because of ""tremendous stresses on our healthcare system"" and said that procedures and protocols would need ""a little bit of time"", which is why the recent restrictions were imposed.

&gt; Wong then said that Singapore should be prepared that the current big wave of cases we are experiencing will not be the last.

&gt; The reason why we should expect more waves of cases in future?

&gt; ""We are one of the most Covid-naive populations in the world,"" he said, before comparing Singapore's experience to that of ""many European countries"" — though he did not mention which ones in particular.

&gt; What it means to be ""Covid-naive""

&gt; To be naive typically means to be inexperienced or innocent, perhaps even gullible.

&gt; Surely Wong would know better than to call Singaporeans naive, you might be thinking.

&gt; However, there is another different meaning of ""naive"" in the medical field — specifically, when one is talking about drugs, or a person's immune system.

&gt; In other words, to be naive to the Covid-19 virus simply means that these individuals are ""not previously infected"", as clarified in a World Health Organisation (WHO) scientific brief on Covid-19 natural immunity.

&gt; Why should Covid-naive Singapore expect future waves of cases?

&gt; As Wong went on to explain, some countries in Europe are not as Covid-naive as Singapore.

&gt; This means that a larger proportion of their populations had been previously infected with Covid-19.

&gt; Wong explained that those countries had high fatalities when they went through their waves of Covid-19 infection in the past year or so, prior to vaccines being rolled out.

&gt; These high fatalities were the ""high price"" that these countries paid for a higher level of natural immunity — that is, immunity from being infected with Covid-19, as opposed to immunity from getting vaccinated.

&gt; This natural immunity, as well as successful vaccination programmes, means that many of these countries now have ""a new Covid-stable situation"", Wong explained.

&gt; Such countries have been able to relax restrictions, while avoiding a resurgence of cases.

&gt; In Singapore, on the other hand, infections were kept low ""for a very long time"", Wong highlighted.

&gt; Here's a simple summary of the comparison that Wong made.

&gt; So is being Covid-naive a bad thing?

&gt; To Wong, Singapore is ""fortunate"" in many ways to be in a different position than our European counterparts.

&gt; Many of those countries experienced their waves of infections prior to, or while vaccines were being rolled out.

&gt; However, Singapore is experiencing its current wave of infections with high vaccination rates.

&gt; This means that most of Singapore's population will be protected against serious illness even if infected.

&gt; ""That also means that we can get through this, and any subsequent waves with fewer casualties than the European countries,"" said Wong.

&gt; But does this mean permanent restrictions?

&gt; Wong said that Singapore will reach a point, ""perhaps months later"", where we will have high vaccinations and high natural immunity.

&gt; If you've been reading closely so far, you'd know that this means we would no longer be Covid-naive by then.

&gt; According to Wong, when this point arrives, Singapore will be ""able to reopen more confidently without seeing a new wave of cases.""

&gt; Ironically, however, Singapore will reach this point of high natural immunity more quickly if restrictions on social gatherings are relaxed, or even removed.

&gt; However, this would come at the expense of the healthcare system, as a surge in infections would not only result in reduced capacity to treat Covid-19 patients with severe symptoms, as well as those with other non-Covid-19 illnesses.

&gt; Thus, the relevance of something you might find familiar from the early days of the pandemic: Flattening the curve.

&gt; Are we still Covid-naive even with almost-85% vaccinated?

&gt; Some might be wondering why past infection rates even matter, since after all, Singapore's Covid-naive population also happens to be one of the most highly vaccinated in the world.

&gt; However, the past infection rates could make a significant difference, as past infection along with vaccination has been said to produce the ""best protection"" against Covid-19 and its variants.

&gt; In many other countries, big waves of infections followed by vaccination meant that significant segments of their population have both natural immunity, and immunity from vaccination — with this outcome having come at the cost of many deaths, and in some cases, an overburdened healthcare system.

&gt; In Singapore, lots of us have the vaccine, but no past infection to confer us with that ""best protection"", which makes us Covid-naive.

&gt; How Covid-naive are we, actually?

&gt; How do Singapore's infections compare to other countries' rates?

&gt; Are we in fact — in Wong's words — ""one of the most Covid-naive populations in the world""?

&gt; Here's a comparison of infection and fatality rates in Singapore (in red), some of the countries that Wong may have been referring to, as well as some countries closer to home, as of Oct. 1, 2021:

&gt; Singapore ranks 98th of 238 on the WHO's list, when countries/territories are ranked from least infections per 100,000 to most infections:

&gt; Singapore does better, however, if we are ranking countries from those which saw the lowest fatalities per 100,000, placing 40th in WHO's list:

&gt; It's important to note that the data is only accurate to the extent that countries are able to detect and report cases, of course.

&gt; It would be useful to bear in mind, however, that Singapore has conducted extensive testing operations whenever Covid-19 cases spiked, as well as for all close contacts of positive cases, meaning that the numbers are not likely to be seriously under-reported.

&gt; Singapore has also continued to insist on testing widely, with Wong's fellow MTF co-chair and health minister Ong Ye Kung explaining that Singapore would continue its practice of testing even asymptomatic cases, at the same Oct. 2 press conference.

&gt; Also, the data is only updated till Oct. 1, 2021, and the additional days since then could well push Singapore's infection and death rates higher than what the WHO data currently shows.

&gt; That being said, the fact that we are seeing unprecedented numbers now means that we are moving further and further from being Covid-naive.

&gt; But this also means that we are on the path to natural immunity, and closer to the lifting of restrictions and ""normal"" life, as far as possible.

&gt; More of what Wong actually said

&gt; If you want to read more, here's the fuller context of what Wong said:

&gt; ""Our overall strategy to reopening has not changed. But this is the first time we are experiencing such a big wave, and it is causing tremendous stresses on our healthcare system and our healthcare workers. Procedures, protocols have to be changed and adjusted, new capacity has to be added into the system. All these take a little bit of time, and that is why we are putting in place these measures in the stabilisation phase so that we can get all these things ready. Even as we go about this exercise during this period, this week and over the next few weeks, I think we should also be prepared that this will not be the last wave we experience. We are riding one major, one big wave now, but we should be mentally prepared that there will be subsequent waves to follow. Why is that so? It is because we are one of the most Covid-naive populations in the world. Unlike for example, many other European countries, we have kept infections in Singapore low for a very long time. Many European countries experienced large waves last year. If you recall, they went through these waves before they had the chance for their people to be vaccinated, and many countries ended up paying a high price, suffering high fatalities because of the waves that they experienced last year. But now, they have a much higher level of natural immunity, and together with the vaccination programmes that they have introduced, many of these countries have reached a new Covid-stable situation where they are able to resume activities and they have not seen any resurgence of cases. We are in a different position. In many ways, we are fortunate because we are facing this wave now with a much more highly vaccinated population, and that means that the vast majority of our people will be protected against serious illness. That also means that we can get through this, and any subsequent waves with fewer casualties than the European countries. Eventually, we will reach a point with high vaccinations and with a higher level of natural immunity, we too will eventually reach a point, perhaps months later, where we are more similar to the European countries, and the Covid-19 situation stabilises, and we are able to reopen more confidently without seeing a new wave of cases.""

I don't know tax law for shit, but these sorts of structures do already exist in legacy finance, albeit with a few more layers of obfuscation. In ten years, it'll be just as hard to understand what's going on in DeFi as it is to understand the Evergrande crisis or what happened in 2008.

Asset backed securities, i believe is the term. Buy assets that are expected to accrue value (debt obligations, like credit card receivables, auto loans, etc--for abracadabra and Alchemix it's mostly money markets by means of Year or Curve or both).

Buy said assets by selling/issuing a security that has nominal worth (ie, a stablecoin).

It's not totally new, but instead of a ""special purpose vehicle"" being created to handle the purchasing/issuance process, we have smart contracts handling it.

Cut out the middle man, and suddenly everyone can access these sorts of products.

As I said, you might like the protocol but the native asset might not necessarily be a good investment.

In middle school you were placed on what they thought you could pass.

crickyb24,"Just by asking this question you’re already ahead of the curve. Just remember that building wealth isn’t about what you make, it’s about what you keep. First, try to write down a general budget that lists all of your recurring monthly expenses (rent, car, utilities, food, etc.) - it doesn’t have to be perfect but it’ll give you an idea of how much money you need to pay out vs what is left over. This process may help you realize that you’re spending more than you’d like on certain things (e.g., maybe you’re spending half your income going out to eat). Next step is to determine what to do with your left over money after monthly expenses. Building an emergency fund of cash is a solid first step. Next, paying off debt is nearly always the right decision. If you have no debt, then you’ll want to start investing some money for retirement. You can open an account called a “Roth IRA” which will allow you to invest your money in a way that helps save on taxes.

newestthings,"Financed cars only really ""pay for themselves"" if you intend to drive them long term. I bought a new Mercedes in 2013 that I'm still driving. For the first 60 months, payments were &gt; 1000/month, now that it's fully paid off, the cost of keeping it on the road is comparatively negligible. I intend to drive the car for 10-12 years, pending on how long it remains problem free, we just passed 8 years and it's been a peach. If you're the kind to flip cars, then it will never be financially beneficial to finance, you're better off buying a used car that has had is past the steep portion of the amortization curve.",2021-10-09 00:46:29

brandnewredditacct,"The risk of all stocks is that they can go down a lot at any time, for any reason. You can obviously use margin to invest and trade, but you must understand the “risk” involved. This is a misunderstood word when it comes to finance. It’s not “risky” in the sense that danger is likely, it’s risky in the sense that if this goes south, you’re going to lose much much much more money than the measly 13% dividend you’re collecting a year. The Covid sell-off put in context against the larger bear markets in stock market history is chump change. As long as you understand the bell curve of possible outcomes, and decided that the reward outweighs the risks…

Additionally, the s&amp;p returns about 8-10% annually. I’m not too sure piling into a div etf on margin for a few % more is worth it. As some other people have said, there’s much better ways to deploy 100k than this.",2021-10-09 19:35:12
SoNotYou,"Autocompounders like Beefy finance. Basically you pick a Stable LP of which you trust the underlining tokens to stay $1 and a trustable project that wont rugpull. For example Quickswaps usdc-dai pool on polygon or Curve mimpool on Arbitrum. Get that LP in exchange they give you a token thay represent you share of the pool. Now you deposit that in an autocompounder like Beefy. They sell the reward token you get for providing liquidity for LP shares and take a fee for doing so.

I used Beefy as an example here since they are on the most chains. Most people here will be one of the chains they support.",2021-10-10 05:15:46

Polythereum,"Kind of.

Centralized Finance means exactly that.  A company owns and operates the exchange as a business, you know, for profit.  They ""own"" all the crypto on the exchange.

Decentralized Finance means no person or organization is the custodian.  The services are executed by software programs (smart contracts).

There are different risks associated with each, although at this time, the community generally regards bluechip exchanges as approximately equally safe.

Bluechip CEXs include the likes of Coinbase and Kraken.

Bluechip DEXs are things like AAVE and Curve.",2021-10-10 05:34:01
SoNotYou,"You can start with any amount. There is no minimum, of course the more you put in the more you earn. Just be aware of gas cost and if its worth it. Since you have take a few gasextensive actions.

Get the stablecoin(s) so do a swap on a dex to get the required stable. This is case only if you dont have the stable yet of course. Most* would require to put 50% stable1 and 50% stable in LP. So you need 250usdc and 250dai for example and cant use 500usdc only. So this would require 2 swaps to get both stables. 

LP them on the exchange (!! Note the LP needs to get rewarded with a token) 

Put the LP on an autocompounder.

This are 4 (could be 3) gas extensive transactions.

I would recommend trying this out with a few dollar on Polygon or similar cheap chain to get the hang of it. Like use quickswap and beefy finance for example. 

*LPs are pool where the 2 tokens in pool are always worth the same amount. For example a pool of 1 eth and 3500usdc. You put in both tokens so that you dont move the price on the dex. Exception is Curve since they treat all stables as =1$ (or =€1 for euro stable) no matter whats in the pool and thats why you can only deposit one stable there.",2021-10-10 05:45:26
Ieperen,"I did the same thing a while back and have been enjoying my gains since. 

As for reasons not to: smart contract risk. And as these products get more and more layered, something that doesn't get talked about much is how smart contract risk increases with every dapp that liquidity gets run through. 

An example:
I deposited my MIM2CRV tokens into the pickle finance contract on arbitrum for automatic compouding and added pickle rewards. An exploit in any one of the following protocols can destroy or severely impact my position:  
 - Pickle Finance  
 - MIM  
 - USDC  
 - USDT  
 - Curve  
 - Arbitrum  

Most of these have been around for quite a while so I feel comfortable in my position, but I would not recommend aping your entire stack into any product that depends on so many things going right. With time these products will only grow more complex, and most of the time that'll be fine, but I think it's good to remind yourself every now and again just how tall some of these defi Jenga towers are becoming.",2021-10-10 06:56:26
Ieperen,"Asked about this in the discord, the Curve LP rewards are currently not taken into account in the APY calculations. They are working on adding this, but this means that you would receive that 35% on top of the spell and pickle rewards. 

Even so, since Pickle finance takes a 20% cut on emission rewards it might still be a better idea to manually compound, depending on the size of your stack and your available time.",2021-10-10 08:03:32
qjornt,"Yeah that's kind of the problem this world suffers from. No equal opportunity is most countries, makes a lot of people miss out on becoming something with their talents. Most successful people are successful because they know the right people and because they've been handed great quality education or training most people can't afford. It takes hard work but most people don't have access to that, no matter how much you work.

I would like to talk about myself as an example in a country where opportunities are more equal than it is in the USA for example, it's a long read so beware if you can't bother. My family fled the balkan war in 1994 to Sweden with literally only our clothes and cash that amounted to $10. That's what we had when we ended up in Sweden, me being 4 months old. During the immigration process my parents would have to learn Swedish, my dad worked for a temporary work agency and moved between different jobs while my mom had to redo some high school classes to get access to university. My parents were 28 and 24 years old at this point. I grew up in a decent neighborhood, went to elementary school and had ""talent"" for math, in reality I just love puzzle solving and math is that to me so I would spend a lot of time studying math as a kid. My mom then went to university, got money from the government like every student does (instead of having to pay insane amounts of money like you do in the USA, my point about equal opportunity), and my dad finally ended up getting a normal full time job at an office due to hard work. It's not a good paid job, he's has Swedish median income. My mom ended up just recently becoming HR manager at a Swedish government agency and her salary is in the 95th percentile. Me, after three great and fun years in high school I went on to study applied physics and electrical engineering, again, I'm given money equal to $300 per month and a student loan of $700 per month at an interest rate of 0.16% per year (currently it's 0.12%), more than enough to pay for rent, food, alcohol, and books. After graduating university I started working in finance, currently I'm a quant analyst making just below $100k/year, though that's including bonuses, almost four years into my career. Literally from rags to riches without having to take the immense risk of indebting ourselves to oblivion, because that's what an equal opportunity does to people who want an opportunity to become something. And on top of this, at about one year old I was diagnosed with hemophilia, which scared my parents but in a country like Sweden it's entirely manageable and my quality of life is equal to someone who does not have hemophilia, because of the medicine Sweden provides to people. All I need to pay is a deductible of $200 per year for medicine that costs $150000 per year.

Sure, taxes are higher here. It literally doesn't bother me one bit because first of all I'd be the biggest hypocrite ever if it did mainly because of nationalized health insurance giving me $150k worth of medicine to stay fully functional and alive. Second of all because it literally doesn't affect my quality of life. I own (not rent) a big one bedroom one livingroom apartment with a huge ass balcony, I eat out whenever I feel lazy to make my own food, I buy the things I need without thinking about if I have enough money, I manage to save at least $1k minimum per month which I just throw into stonks, and I'm holding $15k in a cash account for emergencies which I've never had to tap into, not yet at least. And when bonus month arrives, that's a whole other story. So while it looks like I'm bragging here, I was only laying out the foundation to what I want to say next: People with high incomes who complain about ""high income taxes"" are the absolute worst. I can't spend my money fast enough and I just keep piling it up in assets. Sure I can't buy a yacht with my assets without taking a loan, but why would I want to? And evenso I'll be able to in a matter of years because I'm young and have a very steep salary increase curve on a year to year basis, considering the business I'm in. I'm actively voting for the left party because I want to equalize opportunities further, even if it means I have to pay more taxes (left party wants to increase taxes for higher incomes and lower it for lower incomes), because it won't affect my quality of life negatively in the slightest, it will give poorer families more money to keep, and it will make society a much better place with less misery and as a consequence less violent crime, and that way even increase my own quality of life.",2021-10-10 17:17:04

Math_Is_Funnn,"Speaking as a Canadian university grad, preparing for my fifth SOA exam.

Depending on the rules at your university regarding major/minor combinations, why not do both? For me, I was a math major with an economics minor (and a CS minor, but that got added later on). One of my former roommates did the opposite -- he was an economics major with a math minor. 

Regardless of what you study, unless you're enrolled in an actuarial science program (which my University didn't have), the exams are always going to be a large learning curve. Any probability or statistics-related class you can take will help a lot with some of the of the exams, and the same is true for finance-related classes (though maybe not anymore as they're scrapping IFM). Multivariable calculus is vital. Economics won't help you with the exams as much, but I've met many actuaries here who studied it -- as long as you're comfortable self-studying math, you'll be fine.

Best of luck!",2021-10-11 11:01:36
Lifter_Dan,"If you're good with crypto you can keep on compounding that after ""cashing out"" to stablecoins like USDC and UST.

Assuming you have some knowledge of DEFI?

Knowing DEFI is a skill that only a very small percentage of the population have. Having money AND knowing DEFI is a potent combination.

Even some of the low-risk returns like Curve finance stable pools on Arbitrum or Fantom pay a good percentage.

Two downsides I'm working through:

1. DEFI is very time consuming - to me it is ""My Job"". It earns better yield than traditional finance but I have to be constantly moving money around, avoiding risk and chasing higher yield. A week in crypto is like 3 months in the real world.. If you want to do something else with your time or take a different job/business DEFI is not ideal.
2. Gary Gennsler and the US crypto regulation. Stablecoin regulation is coming. What will happen to our stablecoins when it does.",2021-10-11 11:51:12

Math_Is_Funnn,"I graduated University with a 2.8 GPA, no internships or relevant work experience, and only one exam passed (I took P during the summer before my junior year, so I wouldn't have to study for it at the same time as my classes). Despite that, I landed an entry level position one month post-graduation. It's absolutely possible for you to become an actuary still.

1) The syllabus for both these exams is on the SOA's website. If you go into the exams with no background except for multivariable calculus (cal 3, if you can get up to that point, is all the mathematical background you'll need), you can learn the rest of the concepts on your own (but be prepared to study a LOT to do it). For me I studied through doing hundreds of practice questions on Coaching Actuaries and from downloading a couple of study manuals online.

2) You'll need at least one exam passed to be considered for even an internship in the actuarial world. Quite simply, most employers require proof that you're capable of passing the exams, as you'll be required throughout your employment to continue taking them. Though most places ask for 2-3 exams complete at the start, it is possible to get hired with 1. But I've never heard of someone being hired with 0 exams. Your first step should be to get through one exam. Beyond that, just keep applying! Focus on positions that don't ask for a transcript - your GPA won't matter if you don't have to share it.

3) If you graduate and haven't passed any exams, go sign up for one of the exams. You won't break into the field until you do.

4) It doesn't actually matter what you major in. Me, I studied math. But my coworkers have engineering degrees, economics degrees, finance degrees, etc. At the end of the day, they just want you to have a degree in something (to show that you're able to follow through a task to the end), and then the rest of their judgement rests on your exams. Honestly, you could even major in philosophy and then become an actuary, though if you haven't taken any higher-level math classes in Uni it'll be a much greater learning curve.

Good luck!",2021-10-11 23:53:00
ExoticCommunication,"Calculus just makes stats and finance MUCH easier if you can do a basic derivative. It’s one thing to measure change, it’s another to measure the RATE of change and figure out where you want something to be on a curve. I wish more people understood basic functions beyond “silly S curve thingy looks silly.” Even in my field (partnership management and business development) understanding the THINKING around rates of change can be useful.

Gig4t3ch,"&gt;You really think they've come up with some new math?

Yes, because the majority of their employees could have been employed as researchers at some of the most respected universities in the world. I don't just think they've come up with new models, I'm certain they have come up with new models. Look at some of the [people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ax) they [hired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_E._Baum). 

&gt;That they are the first guys to try to mathematically analyze the stock market?

They're the first to do it as rigorously as they have done. Tons of models in finance have had issues where they use incorrect assumptions. The original Black-Scholes model, probalby the most well known option pricing model, incorrectly assumes that volatility is constant. Now every single bank I can think of quotes options in terms of volatility.


And I believe before 2008 large amounts of banks used the same interest rate curve for discounting and pricing swaps. And everyone assumed the spread between things like LIBOR6M and LIBOR3M was nonexistent, which is also now widely understood to be incorrect. 


The point is that there is still a lot of room for research in finance, and even things that are considered basic have the potential to be improved.",2021-10-12 04:19:04
ThrowawayAccount5260,"I still ask myself this question lol. While I didn't have a great college GPA, it wasn't for lack of intelligence. And at the risk of sounding arrogant, I think when talking to people in an interview or something it's pretty clear I'm not an idiot or something. I just had a hard transition to college which tanked my grades my first semester and that was hard to recover from GPA-wise. I even took a 5th year to graduate.

Beyond that, I didn't really have that stellar of a resume. My only internship experience was my senior year when I interned the full year with the local (small) united way office. My internship was supposed to be working with the finance manager, but they were let go a month into my internship. Not long after, the other 2 employees left and weren't replaced. So for the rest of the school year it was just me and the director. In the end I think it was beneficial because it gave me the opportunity to help with a wide variety of business operations I wouldn't have been able to otherwise because just the 2 of us were working there. (At least that's how I spun the experience in interviews)

Other than that, I did run a small (very small) business a few summers while in college so I'm sure that showed competency with business functions, especially cost management which is a huge portion of my job.

I also think I personally had a bit of an advantage because the defense contractor I work for makes mostly aircraft and I've had a lifelong aviation passion with several hours towards a private pilot's license. So in my interview I sold them on the idea that I'd have a much smaller learning curve for the business than someone with no knowledge/passion for aviation.

So at the end of the day, while I didn't have a great resume or experience, I had a lot I could sell myself on for this particular job with this particular company. I'm not sure it would've worked out as well at another F500 company. I actually passed on applying to my current company for months because I assumed I didn't have a strong enough resume. But thankfully it worked out and hopefully I can build my career upwards using this experience",2021-10-12 04:34:09

Many startups with advanced tech will be bought up to aid the catch up, but I don’t think it’ll make a big difference.   10 years is Tesla solely because around that time we will have hit 1.5 degrees of warming in climate change. We are currently guaranteed 30 years of warming. We are also guaranteed to hit the 2.0 degrees if we hit 1.5 in sub 10 years. At that point in time I expect the world to hit the panic button. Panic button means massive tax credits and green industry investment. Tesla is very well positioned to benefit from such a catalyst with residential solar and more than likely shipping over 1.5 million cars a year by then.](/r/stocks/comments/q5kk1r/if_you_had_to_choose_one_stock_between_tsla_and/hg6pffg/)

If you're not greedy, you can just sell the junk tokens as you get them so it doesn't really matter if they crash in price, or you can automate the process through another platform like Yearn Finance to handle the dirty work for you so you can just keep accumulating your underlying asset rather than deal with the junk tokens yourself.",2021-10-13 03:34:32
mxyz,"It's risky, but not volatile. My highest risk defi play has been paying about 100% APY for the last couple weeks and I will move it if something better comes along.

The risks are so many levels deep. First of all, I'm using Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer 2 chain. A layer 2 chain inherits the security of the main chain, but it's officially still in BETA. It hasn't ever been rolled back, but something catastrophic could happen.

Next, to make that rate, I'm using three different stablecoins, each pegged to the price of the dollar in some way. I have these stablecoins put into a liquidity pool on the decentralized exchange Curve. Curve is considered one of the lowest risk defi platforms in existence on the main Ethereum chain. Now, if any of these 3 stablecoins becomes worthless, arbitragers are going to drain the pool and leave me with the worthless one. So right there I 3x'd my risk for stablecoins losing their peg to the dollar.

Curve liquidity pools pay the liquidity providers in a few ways. First, they collect trading fees from users using the pool. Just like Coinbase or other centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges also charge a fee. These fees get collected by the liquidity providers. It's like owning the actual means of exchange instead of stock in a company like coinbase. It's playing the house in the casino. And as long as the 3 stablecoins keep their peg to the dollar, I don't care which one I own. Whenever I decide to exit, I can choose any or all of the 3 stablecoins to withdraw. The second way Curve pays rewards is by giving away their CRV token and sometimes promotional tokens from another platform. In this case, one of the three stablecoins I'm using is offering their own incentive giving away their own token called SPELL to curve liquidity providers.

But do I want these junk tokens? No way! And do I want to manage converting this junk and pay gas fees each time? No again! I just want to watch the number go up. So I take my IOU I get for providing liquidity to Curve and hand over control to software run by Beefy Finance. That smart contract uses it to farm the SPELL and CRV and trade it for more shares of the Curve liquidity position. This starts compounding my gains multiple times per day with only a tiny amount of exposure to the price of SPELL and CRV. The worst that could happen from those tokens crashing in value is that my rewards start going down and I find the next promo offer that satisfies my risk/reward tolerance.",2021-10-13 09:02:59

Findings from an analysis by the Ministry of Health (MoH) on the cases during the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak as of Tuesday showed that despite the second wave not showing a decrease, it is however stable and not showing an increase. The weekly average of new cases per day has also decreased from 183 per day to 148.




Minister of Health Dato Seri Setia Dr Haji Mohd Isham bin Haji Jaafar shared these details during the daily press conference yesterday.




Dato Seri Setia Dr Haji Mohd Isham said, “A total of 9,132 cases have been reported since the second wave began on August 6 where 9,082 (99.5 per cent) were local transmission cases while 50 were imported cases.”




Based on the dates the cases underwent swab tests, the graph displaying the epidemic curve for the second wave to date also shows the ‘doubling time’ whereby the period for the total number of cases to double is 28.8 days, compared to three to four days when the second wave first occurred. Meanwhile, the reproduction number for the second wave, where the basic reproduction number (R-naught) is the reproduction number when the second wave first occurred, is at level 5.




“At the beginning of the second wave, one positive case caused five new cases. Currently, the effective reproduction number, R(t), is at level 1, which means that one positive case caused one new case. The R(t) at level 1 also indicates a stable state of infection,” said the minister.









In relation to Operasi Pulih conducted since October 4, the minister said, “Out of the 1,756 cases detected, 61 per cent of the cases involved the workplace or staff houses housing the companies’ employees. Only nine per cent were related to household cases or cases where the families lived in private homes.”




The total cases in Category 4 and 5 treated at the National Isolation Centre are all stable. Seventy-one per cent of cases treated in Category 4 and 5 are those who have not been vaccinated, he said.




“The Home Isolation Policy implemented since October 8 has successfully reduced the pressure on bed capacity rate or bed occupancy rate in isolation centres. From the occupancy rate of 82 per cent, the rate has decreased to 78.7 per cent,” said the minister.




“The vaccination rate in the Sultanate has increased as projected and InsyaAllah, we will successfully achieve the target of 80 per cent of the population vaccinated as expected. The increase in vaccination rate is very slow however for those aged 80 and above.”




Minister of Home Affairs Pehin Orang Kaya Seri Kerna Dato Seri Setia (Dr) Haji Awang Abu Bakar bin Haji Apong and Minister at the Prime Minister’s Office and Minister of Finance and Economy II Dato Seri Setia Dr Awang Haji Mohd Amin Liew bin Abdullah also attended.

The total cases in Category 4 and 5 treated at the National Isolation Centre are all stable. Seventy-one per cent of cases treated in Category 4 and 5 are those who have not been vaccinated, he said.




“The Home Isolation Policy implemented since October 8 has successfully reduced the pressure on bed capacity rate or bed occupancy rate in isolation centres. From the occupancy rate of 82 per cent, the rate has decreased to 78.7 per cent,” said the minister.




“The vaccination rate in the Sultanate has increased as projected and InsyaAllah, we will successfully achieve the target of 80 per cent of the population vaccinated as expected. The increase in vaccination rate is very slow however for those aged 80 and above.”




Minister of Home Affairs Pehin Orang Kaya Seri Kerna Dato Seri Setia (Dr) Haji Awang Abu Bakar bin Haji Apong and Minister at the Prime Minister’s Office and Minister of Finance and Economy II Dato Seri Setia Dr Awang Haji Mohd Amin Liew bin Abdullah also attended.

sneakpeek_bot,"&gt; # Singapore must strengthen revenue resilience to ensure no citizen is excluded from the benefits of growth: Lawrence Wong

&gt; SINGAPORE - The lives of Singaporeans and that of their children will become progressively better, and nobody - and no group - will stagnate or feel excluded from the benefits of growth, said Finance Minister Lawrence Wong on Friday (Oct 15).

&gt; Investments in these efforts to mitigate inequality and improve social mobility entail regular spending, and in order to cope with rising spending needs, Singapore will have to strengthen the resilience of its revenue base, he added.

&gt; ""We must continue to reduce inequality and promote greater social mobility among all segments of society and throughout their working lives... All these efforts will require more recurrent funding.

&gt; ""But these are areas that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will not hesitate to spend on - to invest in the progress and wellbeing of our people, to temper inequality and improve social mobility, and to counter the tendency for a mature society to stratify.

&gt; ""These are fundamental tenets of our commitment to Singaporeans.""

&gt; He gave this assurance to all Singaporeans, as he outlined Singapore's fiscal strategies and thinking behind them, at the 35th Singapore Economic Roundtable organised by the Institute of Policy Studies.

&gt; The roundtable gathers senior private sector economists, academics, business leaders and policy makers to discuss key macroeconomic policy issues facing Singapore.

&gt; Mr Wong said that Singapore has succeeded so far in running a prudent and effective fiscal policy. But the task at hand will only become harder, given three key challenges or ""curves"" that will determine the trajectory of the country's fiscal strategy.

&gt; These are: widening faultlines, and the threat to social cohesion when there is accumulated advantage by a small group of people; a rapidly ageing population, which means a shrinking labour force and an ever greater need for healthcare and aged care; and climate change - an existential challenge that calls for urgent action today, even if its worst effects will only be felt decades from now.

&gt; Like other countries, Singapore will need more fiscal resources to tackle these challenges of inequality, demographics and emissions effectively, he said.

&gt; The goal is to build a society that is even more fair and just - where every child can achieve his or her dreams and every worker can stand tall, and where every person can be accepted regardless of social background or age, race or religion.

&gt; ""But how can we ensure sufficient resources without placing an undue burden on our current or future generations? That is a question that keeps many Finance Ministers awake at night.

&gt; ""That means we must be alive to the immense responsibility the Government has as steward of our resources. What we have inherited from yesterday, we must wisely guard; what we have been entrusted with today, we must responsibly utilise.""

&gt; He pointed out that Singapore has made good progress on social mobility. A 2015 study by MOF found that of the children born from 1978 to 1982 to parents who were at the bottom one-fifth of the income stakes, 14.3 per cent moved to the top fifth among their peers in their 30s - higher than corresponding figures for other countries in Northern America and Europe.

&gt; This data was recently updated for children born from 1985 to 1989, and the percentage was 14 per cent - slightly lower than before, but still much better than many other places, he said.

&gt; He noted that it is not enough to tackle inequality through initiatives such as SkillsFuture, the progressive wage approach and top-ups to the Workfare Income Supplement scheme for lower-wage workers.

&gt; 

&gt; Singapore, too, is one of the fastest ageing societies, with one-quarter of Singaporeans projected to be 65 and above by 2030. This can place significant strain on society, he said.

&gt; The Republic's healthcare spending has already tripled in dollar terms over the past decade, and is now at 2.2 per cent of GDP. This expenditure is expected to increase further to 3 per cent of GDP by 2030.

&gt; ""I have said before that the revenue from the increase in GST will go towards supporting our healthcare expenditure. But this revenue will not be enough to cover the additional healthcare spending.

&gt; ""And we can expect healthcare spending to keep rising even beyond 2030, while the decline in the working age citizen population will shrink our income tax base. These are difficult problems, and there are no easy solutions.""

&gt; With shrinking labour force growth, productivity will be key, added Mr Wong. This means helping businesses to transform and shift away from manual processes, and equipping people with new skills.

&gt; It also means growing the silver economy, raising the retirement and re-employment ages, and providing wage top-ups and grants to incentivise companies to employ senior workers.

&gt; On the emissions curve, he said that Singapore is committed to this global effort, and is taking proactive steps to decarbonise its economy.

&gt; This will not be an easy transition because the country is at a double disadvantage - a lack of land space and natural resources which makes it very challenging to scale up renewable energy; and significant flood risks as a low-lying island.

&gt; But Singapore's economic story has always been one where it defied the odds, he said. ""So we are seriously considering the import of green electricity, and findings ways to overcome the high cost, and technical and security challenges.""

&gt; Singapore is also actively pursuing new opportunities to grow as a sustainable finance hub, and investing in R&amp;D on new technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture.

&gt; To arrive at a fairer, greener, and more inclusive society, Singapore must re-examine its fiscal strategies so that its tools can meet the tasks at hand, said Mr Wong.

&gt; It must ensure that its programmes and investments are funded in a fiscally efficient manner that preserves inter-generational equity.

&gt; Singapore has gone beyond just awarding grants to businesses, to using loans and equity to support companies. This will allow it to recycle its fiscal resources in the long run.

&gt; It also risk-shares with banks, and provides support or invests with private sector partners such as Clifford Capital and Heliconia.

&gt; ""In this way, we borrow their commercial lens in the selection of companies to groom into local champions. These expanded ways of investing in our economy and viable companies are crucial in stretching the public dollar,"" he added.

&gt; Singapore also strengthens inter-generational equity between the present and future, by making use of borrowing to finance long-term infrastructure projects.

&gt; The Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act, or SINGA, allows the Government to issue bonds to fund nationally significant infrastructure with high upfront costs but large long-term benefits.

&gt; Some think that borrowing will create more fiscal space, and so Singapore should borrow more.

&gt; But the Minister cautioned that borrowing is not a panacea to fiscal challenges, as what is borrowed today has to be paid back tomorrow, and borrowing simply shifts the burden to the future generation.

&gt; That is why Singapore is limiting its borrowing to long-term projects, where it makes sense to share the costs equitably between present and future generations, he explained.

&gt; ""We should never seek to make our own lives easier at the expense of future generations. That would not be responsible. Instead, we should always seek to pass on a Singapore in good shape to our future generations.

&gt; ""This has been a cornerstone of our fiscal philosophy since independence, and we will continue to uphold this.""

&gt; Strengthening revenue resilience is also crucial, he said, adding that compared to other countries, Singapore is in a strong fiscal position.

&gt; It has its reserves as an endowment, from which it draws a stream of resources to spend every year. Most advanced countries pay 2 to 3 per cent of GDP each year just to service their debts, he said.

&gt; In Singapore's case, its Net Investment Return Contributions (NIRC) give an additional revenue of around 3 per cent GDP on average, which has helped keep the overall tax burden low.

&gt; Some want Singapore to spend even more from its endowment.

&gt; But this idea should not be tossed about ""flippantly"", said Mr Wong, as returns from the NIRC already face significant headwinds in a more challenging global investment environment, and one must never underestimate the kinds of shocks that may plague Singapore in the future.

&gt; Just for Covid-19 alone, the Government has planned to use more than $50 billion from the reserves - more than 10 times the amount it had drawn for the 2009 global financial crisis, he added.

&gt; He concluded that Singapore's long-term outlook and prudence have put it in a stable place fiscally, and enabled it tostrengthen its social compact over the years.

&gt; In the end, he said, the country's fiscal system must sustain a more fair and just society.

&gt; ""This is our vision, and this is what our fiscal strategies have been built on. We will wisely steward our resources and never stop thinking about tomorrow, so we can have an ever fairer, greener, and more inclusive Singapore.""

oidoglr,"You didn’t include the rest of my sentence which said “through my CU”. I also stated previously that I do give the F&amp;I office a chance to offer a lower finance rate. 

If the dealer says I can get a lower purchase price on the car if I finance through them then it’s a simple calculation of the difference in interest rate between what my CU is offering and the dealer finance to look at the total difference. Not that big of a deal when you’re negotiating from home outside the pressure of a sales office. 

For example, when I bought a new car the option was an option to finance at 0% or take $5k off the MSRP (end of the MY a few years ago before the current car market obviously) so it was $25k @ my CU’s 3.5% or VW credit’s $30k at 0%. Taking the dealer financing over a 6 year loan term I would have paid $2,246 more for the car even at 0%

I have only bought one new car though (I get bored with cars pretty quickly - 2.5 years is the longest I’ve owned any one so I at least buy them past their initial depreciation curve) - so my advice is more specific to used cars that tend not to have the same promotional offers from the manufacturer to move new product.",2021-10-16 00:51:18

start100000,"The first US-listed bitcoin exchange traded funds are on the verge of launching next week with the deadline for an objection from America’s top securities regulator fast approaching.  
According to people familiar with the matter, the ETFs are likely to be given a green light by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, marking the culmination of an eight-year battle to win approval.  
ProShares Bitcoin Strategy would be the first ETF to launch, probably on Tuesday, when the 75-day period during which the SEC could object will have expired. A day later, the Invesco Bitcoin Strategy ETF, would also be allowed to launch unless the regulator blocks it.  
ProShares and Invesco declined to comment. The SEC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  
The likely approvals could open the floodgates to a stream of similar products, potentially fuelling a further leg up in the price of the cryptocurrency, which was trading 4.8 per cent higher on Friday at a shade under $60,000 on the Coinbase exchange.  
All the ETFs will be based on bitcoin futures contracts, rather than the spot price, with the SEC known to be concerned about a potential lack of liquidity and the risk of price manipulation on spot exchanges.  
It is still possible that the ETFs hit a roadblock, with the SEC having until midnight on Monday to raise objections to ProShares’ vehicle.  
As recently as last week Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC, described crypto finance as the “Wild West or the old world of ‘buyer beware’ that existed before securities laws were enacted”, adding that it is “rife with fraud, scams and abuse”.  
However, Gensler has hinted that he is more comfortable with trading on regulated futures venues such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  
Overnight the SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy tweeted: “Before investing in a fund that holds bitcoin futures contracts, make sure you carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits.”  
The likely approvals come eight years after entrepreneurs and Olympic rowers the Winklevoss twins applied to launch the first bitcoin ETF in the US, at a time when bitcoin was trading nearer $1,000.  
A swath of proposed funds has bitten the dust since, with the US having been overtaken by jurisdictions such as Sweden, Switzerland, Jersey, Germany and Canada that have permitted crypto exchange traded products.  
Almost 50 crypto ETPs are now up and running worldwide with combined assets of $14bn, according to data from TrackInsight. This includes 16 bitcoin ETPs, including inverse vehicles, which rise in price when bitcoin falls and vice versa.  
US investors have had access to private trusts such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, however, which has grown to $37bn in assets since launching in 2013, indicating the appetite for the cryptocurrency in the US.  
Weekly net flows into dedicated cryptocurrency funds as a whole hit a four-year high of more than $2.5bn earlier this month, according to data provider EPFR.  
While the SEC believes bitcoin futures are more appropriate for retail investors than trading in the underlying spot market, they are unlikely to deliver the same returns.  
The bitcoin futures market typically, though not always, trades with a modestly upward sloping curve, known as contango. This means that, more often than not, a fund will incur a loss when it rolls the front-month contract into a longer-dated one.  
Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Invest, which has filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, estimated the cost of this roll yield at 5 to 10 per cent a year.  
Dave Abner, global head of business development of Gemini, a crypto exchange, said that “while bitcoin futures ETFs are said to offer more protections for investors, this approach could unfortunately create another set of returns that don’t equal reality for investors seeking investment exposure to bitcoin”.

29187765432569864,"Imagine going straight from high school into med school. In many countries if you can get accepted into med school you enter it directly from high school, so you are not burnt out, and worn out by 4 years of meaningless college.  And you are not in debt for those 4 years.  The USA “education” system is set up to be elitist and to weed people out.  In many other countries their system is set up to reward and to advance smart people, as opposed to restrict the people who don’t have the means to spend thousands of dollars for 4 years of undergraduate school before spending even more money for more years.  The USA higher education system is set up to be keep people from easily advancing in life. The system basically discriminates against poor people. The system could easily be changed over night but the politicians and leaders don’t talk about that.  I know many great doctors from other countries and none of those doctors had to attend 4 years of college prior to med school.  And get this, in many countries if you do choose to go to college then the government PAYS for your college.  So in those countries instead of the system making it very hard to advance in life, the system is designed to make it easy to advance. Just imagine not needing to know anything from 4 years of undergraduate college in order to be a good doctor.  
Our system discriminates against people who don’t have enough money to go to college, and then once you are in college it weeds you out further. Many professors grade tests and papers on a curve so even though you earn a 90 on test, your grade gets curved down.  Some courses will only permit a certain number of students to have an A, so they curve people’s grades down until that magical number is reached.  So imagine you spend tens of thousands of dollars to go to college, and you get all A’s on your tests, but due to the curve your grade becomes a B.  So at the end of your 4 years your gpa is a 3.25 instead of the 3.75 that you actually earned.  This is just another example of how the system makes it hard to advance.  Then years after you graduate and you apply for jobs, say with the government, you discover that many of the higher paying positions require a grade point of 3.5 in order to be considered, but due to those professors that curved down, you are ineligible for the higher paying positions, even though you are competent in the subject and  have relevant work experience.  Our system is designed to keep people down, not designed to facilitate their advancement in life.  If high schools wanted to facilitate their students careers they would teach critical thinking skills, interviewing skills, internet research nuances, ethics, personal finance, and organizational skills and specific trade skills and employment skills so you can get a good job out of high school without going to college.  For example auto mechanics, or computer engineering, or air conditioning repair, or construction or welding or veterinary technology, etc. 
But instead they teach foreign languages, algebra, biology, physics, chemistry, trigonometry, geometry, etc. I have not needed chemistry, algebra, physics, foreign languages etc. since graduating high school and if the need arises for any of these subjects I can use the internet to figure things out.  Basically most of high school now days is obsolete and meaningless in terms of academics BUT without great grades the door to college is closed.  So we make great grades in high school in order to get into a college that curves our GPA down.  Most of high school is not needed for anything due to being able to use the internet to answer questions.  Shakespeare is useless in life, it serves no purpose to teach it.  If I need to solve a math algebra question now days I can use the internet or an app, I certainly don’t need to do years of homework.   Most everything we are taught in high school is not necessary for us to learn, 50 years ago it served a purpose but now it is just a colossal waste of time.  So yea, you do what you are supposed to, you attend school, get good grades and it is actually meaninglessness unless you are willing to go massively into debt to go to college.  The academics of high school are meaningless, but it is useful for teenagers to learn self discipline, critical thinking skills, time management, interpersonal skills, and how to have good judgment.  Approximately 1/2 of high school graduates go to some kind of college and they go into debt in order to attend college. So we are setting up some of our smartest people to start their lives with massive debt that takes decades to pay off, and somehow this system is supposed to be good for our society.  The system is just massively messed up.  You have done nothing wrong, you are swimming against the current as are millions of other people.  You are not alone.",2021-10-16 11:45:01

That way your car will not become a financial burden.

FlyingSaucer100,"I left academia right after my PhD, so this may not be that relevant to you. I specialized in theoretical physics, and I had quite a lot of experience with Pythong and Matlab programming for numerical computing and stochastic modelling.

Unfortunately, my knowledge and expertise were quite niche and when I tried getting into areas like quantitative finance or data science, I couldnt make it past the resume screeining stage, despite having my resume reviewed professionally. I tried big tech companies like Google but I couldnt make it past the technical interviews, I simply dont have a background in computer science so it was very hard for me to catch up.

The_Wind_Cries,"Sure man.   


First off, I will say that Geist has risks that are non trivial.  So i'll start there.  


**RISKS / FLAGS:**

\-The dev/leadership team is anonymous. Meaning it's hard to get access to someone who actually is runing the project and knows how it works and where it is going for straight answers.  


\-The tokenomics are really challenging for early investors. Geist has a max suply of 1 billion, but as of today only \~24 million of those have been emitted. With \~2 million more being emitted each day. That's significant inflation of supply for a new platform. And while Geist has already become the biggest platform in FTM in terms of TVL (more on that later)... FTM defi is just not big enough yet to support buying pressure with that much inflation even on its biggest platform.  


\-That has led to the coin dropping its value at a dizzying rate. Everyone with a brain knew it was going to drop pretty hard like most farm/reward tokens do in their first weeks/months, but the rate at which Geist has dropped (and is still dropping) is pretty significant. Owing to a few factors (the tokenomics, but also whale activity which we will get to). It makes it really important for anyone getting into the project to have really realistic expectations of DCA/timing their moves and to have a good strategy in place so they don't APE in and get rekt.  


\-TMS is decreasing. Although the 12 billion TMS that Geist had in its first 1-3 days was not sustainable and was mostly driven by early hype, it's now at around 5.39 billion. If it holds there, great. But if it keeps going down? Then platform fees (which are the revenue engine that drives rewards and incentivizes folks to stake/lock their geist) will follow. Now Geist offers an important functionality to the FTM ecosystem in terms of lending/borrowing, but much of that activity is incentivized by geist rewards. So watching TMS is key.  


\-BTC rewards on the platform are not currently being distributed. Meanwhile ETH, FTM, DAI, USDT and USDC rewards are all working fine. Now the dev team has said this is an issue with the platform needing to accumulate a certain amount of BTC before it's distributed... and that BTC rewards will be distributed to lockers and stakers soon... but has been evasive on giving a timeline or explaining how much progress has been made to hit that point. Not a good look.  


\-Whales are actively using the platform in a way that makes them money, but punishes non-whale investors who are interested/passionate/keen on the project. There are two large whales in particular (with 500m+ on the platform) who dump all their Geist every few hours. Driving the price down hard in big jumps. This definitely has punished some folks who aped in to the platform in its first day or two, and turned off a lot of other retail investors who might otherwise have invested in what otherwise is a pretty interesting project.  


**OPPORTUNITIES / GOOD SIGNS:**  


With that important context out of the way, why I believe in the project.  


\-The multi-sig team is solid. Really solid.  


It includes:  


a) Michael Chen (Fantom Foundation)  
b) Eerie (SpookySwap co-founder)  
c) 0xngmi (co-founder DefiLlama)  
d) Aveen Hujiari (co-founder Geist)  
e) Charlie Watkins (Curve Finance)

Now it's unclear how involved in the day to day (if at all) these guys are, but their involvement at least as far as being the custodians of the Protocol is pretty darn good. It definitely suggests a layer of credibility that had to be there for the platform to establish TVL of 4+ billion in just two weeks.  


\-The platform has real utility. FTM needed a large scale borrowing/lending platform where it was easy and quick to loan crypto and borrow against it (if desired) and it shows in how much capital flowed into Geist from the jump. I use it myself even for things that have nothing to do with the $geist token itself, and several large whales are making use of it as well. It's sometimes fun to watch their wallets and see the moves they make.  


\-The platform has injected a ton of life and TVL into the FTM ecosystem. Despite only being two weeks old, it's far and away the [biggest FTM platform with 2.6b in TVL. Spooky is second place with 600m](https://twitter.com/Crypto_Judge1/status/1449926055041527815/photo/1). That says a lot right there. Geist brings a lot to the table in building the backbone for future DEFI growth for FTM.   


\-FTM rewards: the platform is on pace to unlock the highest tier of FTM rewards based on its TVL. In the meantime, Michael Chen himself promised (and delivered on the promise) to incentivize people to use it with his own FTM. That strikes me as a powerful endorsement (backed up by real money) from a major FTM figure.  


\-The revenue sharing model is legit. You earn real ETH, FTM, USDC, DAI, USDT right now for Geist that you have staked or locked. In addition to Geist. And right now combined it works out to about 6% / day of your total locked/staked amount made up of those coins. Most comes in Geist but the amount of eth and ftm you generate is still non trivial.   


\-APR has been pretty darn consistent for locked/staked rewards on the platform. Staking is still over 300% and has held up over time. On the locked Geist front,  tt started in the tens of thousands on day 1 of course, but it's still at 2350-2400% right now and was in that exact same range 24 hours ago. That rate of decay is really damn nice, although will it last long term? Uncertain. But it's holding up well so far.  


  


There are probably more things to add to either list. All in all, definitely not a project where at the moment it's easy (or even remotely right) to just say to someone ""YOU GOT TO INVEST IN GEIST. IT'S A NO BRAINER DUDE! TO THE MOON!""   


It's imperfect, and still in that awkward knife edge phase where we are all still waiting to see if it's truly going to be able to live up to all the hype and excitement it generated at launch or if it's just going to be bled dry by whales in the short term leaving regular folks who believed in the platform long term holding the bag in the end. But for the moment, I feel it's a project worth being cautiously optimistic about and carefully using/interacting with with a clear strategy in mind and open eyes about the risks.",2021-10-18 13:27:21

u-rkallio,"Hey, we seem to share a similar wish to slow the progression of the game!

&gt;	I prefer playing long Skyrim playthroughs. A long time it bothered me, that I become too powerful too soon, so when I found the {{Sykrim Skill Uncapper}} and an uncapper.ini for ordinator I set up skillgain to 4 times slower. Albeit this helped, I still tend to end up too powerful at some point. I would love to play the game without changing the difficulty midgame and with always some challenge to it. Any suggestions?

I used to have this exact setup.  It takes a lot of tweaking to get the progression between different skills right, because difficulty also effects how much skill xp you get in combat for some skills, but not for others.

Anyway, I moved to using {{Experience}}, with the {{Static Skill Leveling}} add on.  This way I still get to tweak the overall progression speed of my character, and I don’t need to micromanage skill usage (training alchemy/smithing/enchanting especially is a pain).

You’ll still end up becoming way too powerful in the late-game, that’s just because the Skyrim progression curve is so wack.  The game starts with you dealing damage in the 5-15 points per hit range, but that quickly grows to multiple hundreds.  There’s no way balancing encounters with that kind of power creep, because early game opponents with 30-60 health will always fall in a single hit, while late game NPCs with health pools in the hundreds or thousands will be damage sponges, especially on legendary difficulty.

One way to mitigate this is to avoid utilizing one or two of smithing/enchanting/alchemy, which will flatten the progression quite a bit.  There are also NPC stat rescaler patches on the nexus which reduce the disparity between weak and strong NPCs.  What you should be aiming for is a flatter damage progression curve for you as well as the NPCs.

&gt;	The third thing that bothers me is the gold. I love to find treasures, but when my treasury is stacked with gold, gems and jewelry without any desire to spend it, the motivation to find even more suffers a little. I found {{Honed Metal}} to be a pretty good gold sink for a while, but it also contradicts my hope to not become too powerfull too soon, you do not even have to invest perks in your blacksmith skill anymore. The master pickpocket perk in {{Ordinator}} which lets you spend 50k for a perk point is also a good gold sink, but also supports becoming too powerful. {{RE - Real Estate Continued}} allows me to spend large amounts of gold, but not without returning even larger amounts after time passes. I don’t want to pay taxes for my horse, properties or followers like suggested in {{Simple Taxes SE}}, somehow this just doesn’t fit in my Skyrim-conception. I give some of my followers a pay with {{Nether’s Follower Framework}}. Yet, even without brewing and selling potions I still end up with more gold then I can spend. Do you have any ideas where I could spend it? Is there any mod that lets me finance and support a mercenary army to fight the Thalmor, far from Skyrim? Or something that lets me build a castle, bit by bit, for hundred-of-thousands gold pieces? Sinfully expensive feasts to invite friends and impress the nobility? Thank you for any suggestions!

I never seem to have this problem with becoming too rich.  I use honed metal, and on most characters I don’t level up any of enchanting/smithing/alchemy at all.  Instead I spent my money buying new weapons/enchantments/potions/tempering services from merchants to survive the next dungeon crawl.  Playing on legendary, I find I’m always spending the gold I have on hand for any kind of edge I can get.  Make sure you’ve got equipment durability system installed as well, it makes the tempering service that honed metal offers a nice money sink.

Followers are a great gold sink.  I use NFF’s weekly payment feature to balance the help I get from having a follower.  Of course, having a follower, I end up also having to buy gear upgrades and potions for them as well.  Make sure you’ve got the SKSE plugin that makes followers respect the game’s difficulty setting, otherwise they just become damage sponges on higher difficulty levels, and you end up not needing to upgrade their equipment as much.",2021-10-19 05:20:24
Andynr,"Vesper Finance. VSP. It's a decentralized platform on Ethereum where you can deposit e.g. stablecoins such as USDC and earn around 5%\~ APY with 5%\~ APY on top of that in their VSP token.

thomgloams,"Oh I didn't mean to imply anything about Curve. I've used Curve for stable swaps a bunch. I had never used their pools until recently.  And I started with a stablecoin pool but exited once I realized that anything under idk, ~$1000 (?) isn't worth it because of fees incurred from approving, depositing, withdrawing, claiming etc. Which of course, (I'm an idiot I know) is how they can provide rewards. 
Nothing wrong with that.  But if ETH fees (to a much lesser extent FTM or MATIC fees) feel large to a person (like me) then LP probably isn't a good idea. 

Which is unfortunate since as more come into crypto, the rewards will go down but the fees will be the same. And ppl who want to explore DeFi and farming with $500 are just gonna lose money. 

Unless one has some real inside info on an IDO or a platform drop, some kind of edge, it doesn't seem worth it to expose yourself to the crypto you were holding already, + IL + reward volatility + needless expensive fees.
Am I wrong?  DeFi is not a game even tho it is the gamification of finance. You're not gonna turn $500 into $5000 unless you have a huge strategic advantage (many do I'm sure) or a giant bankroll to start with. 

Pls tell me I'm wrong tho! All that farming fun doesn't have to end, does it? Dang",2021-10-19 12:50:31
CatSE---ApeX---,"Hi!

I agree with your sentiment on execution risk, and hiw the team / collective skill-set is key. 

1) I would recommend TheKOOKreports more than excellent team walkthrough post. It was taken down from wsb by mods, reposted on his private sub and is linked by me from the AST subreddit. In short they have assembled a set of ace professionals from defense, finance and from competing companies a lot of engineering/ space operation personell. A substantial amount from Blue Origin. I have seen one leave, he was in charge of areanging the delayed ride-share on a Soyuz. The managment seems to me able to attract competent people and acts in a meritocratic manner as to who stays. So I’d pass the in-depth questions on the team to Kook who did the research. I’ll say something about Able though. He worked as engineer at cellular connectivity company Ericsson in my home country they are cellular technology pioneers. He then went on to lead a succesful satellite communications company which he sold fot ~1/2 Bn USD. This means he is a seasoned CEO in the SatCom industry who has made profits. He has seeded the company with his own funds, is on minimum wage and all his outcome from the enterprise lies with success and his priority voting rights shares. AST is his baby.
Looking into his partner choice / mutualistic spectrum sharing businessmodel / how he shys CapEx / how the designs are next level from tech and regulatory fit perspective I am nothing short of impressed.
He is shy and nervous in front of cameras. I am to. He gets a lot of criticism for it. In my country the US TV commercial salesman type CEO would not be taken seriously but in the US that is considered got rethoric skills. So his humble/shy tech geek apperance is something I like but others dread. He must be another person with cameras Off the deals he struck with world leading enterprises shows this: AT&amp;T, Vodafone Rakuten/Altiostar, Samsung and so on. 

I will also say something on Adriana. The 3Bn Cisneros fam. Invesat company she runs made their fortunes broadcasting from Space. She went to launch events as a teen. For a US Space Billionaire, they both live in Florida, there you have the real deal. She actually made her billions in space. 
Her saying sums her up: ”Results not promises”.

2)  Timeline was pushed 3 months on a Soyuz launch delay (the delay was the prinary Korean satellite CAS-500-2 not AST fault). And as Marshack put it, this is inherent to Space and that guy who vetted the tech said the remaining risks were timing risks of that sort. So they had this business update call after the move to Space-x Falcon Transporter was announced. In that call they outlined the timeline. It is largely in agreement with the original ip. No milestone is pushed more than these three months and timeline catches up in the end. I would feel more comfortable that holds true if we see launch agreements drop on the Bluebird 1-4  and Bluebitd 5-20 upcoming launches sometime in the next half year that would serve as additional catalysts. They were under NDA with Space-x since 2017, so things might be in the works without us knowing.

3) most my capital is in my real estate/ agriculture enterprise so that investing in hypergrowth is my inflation hedge, a diversfication of my investments. I today hold well over 40,000 common shares at a 8.5 cost base. Growth rate should slow near 2027/28 and I will likely scale down / diversify the investment by then following my Lassonde curve theory of share price trajectory as the constellation enters depletion phase. But I will also be older and likely keep some for the dividends. So I am long ASTS. IF and WHEN this starts a catalyst driven runup I plan to extract most of my cost base. That will be gradually in the 30-50 range. This way I plan to be able to handle the volatility better as the value increases, thinking all I originally invested is secured. My only two other holds on the stock market are ENLV and LAC. Before that I held one stock, MRNA, which I invested in at the start of the pandemic I have since sold. My philosophy here is to research a few select companies and hold them during their hypergrowth phase until they have executed. I am by far heaviest in ASTS beeing my highest conviction case. Such an all in hypergrowth / high risk portfolio only makes sense if I count my ”value” real estate investment as part of the total. If AST does not execute I will loose portfolio value, on the flip side if they execute it will have outsized gains.
I have made an Net Present Value sensitivity analysis on the ip Free Cash Flow. There is this chart you can google and find. Lets you evaluate the company on a partial success basis / high discount rate.

If I use a very low percentage of future cash flow, say 40%, as a proxy for a 60% failure risk or just a 49% partial successful execution. And I use a high discount rate, say 12%, then the company is still worth much more than current market cap. That NPV chart lets you do that valuation by your own percentages/rates.

And this is when asserting a value of 0 to 51% owned subsidiary Nanoavionics, with 90 missions flown and launching the GIoT 72 sat constellation of their own. And counting only cash flows up until 2030 and 0 revenue thereafter. The company is just severely undervalued. This is I think because as a first mover their actual risks are not well understood. Imo they are mostly timing risks, there will be a few launch delays (there usually are), some countries will most likely delay spectum / market access causing a delay in some of the cash flow. So there is that delay/timing risk. But it does not add up to 80-90% failure risk / cash fliw reduction where the company is now valued. It adds up to 20-30% as a proxy for delayed cash flows and when you do the DCF / NPV math on that you see it is an investment worth taking.

Inadorable,"Cheann Comhairle,

My first involvement in Northern Irish politics was helping my good friend Lady_Aya write the then LPNI party manifesto - followed by a hard fought campaign in the constituency of Derry and Tyrone North against the then First Minister and the leader of the Ulster Workers Party, in which the LPNI made gains compared to the pre-election polling despite one of the most impressive efforts by the UWP to win the seat.

Following the election I was asked to take the positions of AERA minister and later Finance minister by our former party leader, /u/ohprkl - I gladly accepted the former, and had to be convinced to take up the latter position. It’s a big workload and a significant responsibility to deliver a budget and I wasn’t sure whether I’d have the time to do so. Since then I’ve taken to my job and decided that if I were to do it, I would do it right. 

During the term I’ve passed two major pieces of legislation, spending a combined billion pounds in investments, subsidies, wages and grants. Other legislation submitted to the speakership or planned shall move another 900 million pounds as I attempt to ensure the major programmes included in this budget are carried out, and not just lines on a budget the people of Northern Ireland, and indeed, the United Kingdom, are asked to fund.

Cheann Comhairle, when I was writing this budget, I was constantly thinking about where I’ve come from. About my youth growing up in our rural countryside, as a working class, LGBTQ+ woman in a catholic and too often not accepting environment. As a child they underestimated me. As a teenager, they discriminated against me. As a university student, my working class background meant that I was never truly accepted.

And yet, Cheann Comhairle, here I stand. No doubt, these are experiences that many fellow Catholics in this country have shared, but still ones that have shaped me. Shaped my views on society, on politics and on economics. And these views have shaped the budget that the Executive has introduced to this Assembly today.

That means this budget is unapologetically in favour of the interests of rural Northern Ireland, unapologetically social democratic and strongly in favour of greater social mobility, redistribution of wealth and economic development. Whether the Ulster Unionists or the Alliance Party can support this budget based on their own views is neither here nor there. Of course more support is preferable - but whether my budget holds up to their expectations of what a good budget should be is not my business. I am proud of the work I have delivered, and the policies laid out in the budget.


Now, let us get to those policies. The first of these may have taken the collapse of an executive, but Northern Ireland shall be raising the Corporation Tax rate to the minimum level proposed by the President of the United States, noted Irish Catholic Joseph R. Biden. In raising the rate to 15%, we are also raising over 100 million extra in tax revenues. This extra revenue helps Northern Ireland run a significant surplus for the next few years, even after the public minimum wage comes into full effect.

This budget cuts the rate of Land Value Tax levied in Northern Ireland from 1.5% to 0.75%. To some, this doesn’t sound like a lot. Less than a pence to the pound - but this saves hundreds of thousands of people in NI hundreds of pounds per year. This especially benefits farmers in this country, who today pay an effective 33% tax on their income due to LVT - making them the most heavily taxed people in this country. This budget will cut that tax in half and ensure our agricultural industry stands stronger than before.

I’m proud that this budget includes a fund for Water Management under the AERA budget, which also includes the fund for flood protection into the total. This fund shall not only be used for making Northern Ireland’s rivers, lakes and seas cleaner than they are now, but it shall also be used for rewilding projects along our rivers, the creation of new lakes along them, allowing our rivers to run more naturally and giving them the room to do so. The fund will also work in tandem with the tree planting programme to create a greater delay between when rain falls and the water reaches the river itself - flattening the curve and limiting the intensity and frequency of catastrophic failures of flood defense infrastructure.

The increase in NIEA will allow the current agency to improve its staffing levels. Today, they are still too low for the agency to do its job properly, leading to damage to our natural environments and events like the fish kills earlier this year. Ensuring we protect our nature and our biodiversity is a duty we have, not only to future generations or along religious lines, but also to ourselves, so all of us can continue to enjoy the beautiful nature of the country we live in.

The increase in subsidies to Libraries NI has been lowered by £90 million after an investigation with the help of /u/phyrik2222 into the use of this spending has found that this would quadruple the funding to all Libraries in Northern Ireland, a level of spending we considered inappropriate for the goals laid out by the previous budget. However, this does not mean that the executive does not support the work of our archivists, historians and researchers - 10 million of the PRONI fund has been made an annualised spending commitment to enable a digitalisation offensive to ensure more and more of the items and documents held at the archive are digitalised and thus more easily accessible to researchers, who will also be eligible for funding and assistance through the PRONI’s new fund for historians and researchers using the archive for their research projects.
The newly established rural culture fund will help protect the arts in rural parts of Northern Ireland flourish, with the possibility for writers, poets and artists using all kinds of languages and techniques to practice their work in our towns and villages. It allows for small local museums to continue their operations and maybe even expand. The Fishing museum of Northern Ireland will give our maritime and fluvial cultures the recognition they deserve, as well as create jobs for the direct area it shall be placed in.

The Apprenticeship Wage Subsidy included in this budget means that apprentices in Northern Ireland will finally be able to get a proper living wage, whilst still being competitive on the market with already qualified workers in their fields. This will transform lives, with apprentices now being paid over £10,000 more on an annual basis for their work and thus able to live happy, fulfilling lives off their work, rather than struggling to get by. The subsidy will ensure women and disabled people are more competitive on this market as well, giving the former more chance to find employment despite sexist attitudes and thus slowly normalise women working in these fields. This also means that disabled people are able to find fulfilling, well-paid work where they learn a valuable skill and thus are able to compete in the labour market.

Whilst the revaluations in the Education department do mean a net decrease in spending in the department, the spending is being used more effectively. The implementation of free tutoring means that all students in Northern Ireland are able to get the support they need to succeed, regardless of their (parents) financial means. The Rural Schools fund means that we can ensure our primary and secondary schools in rural areas can stay open and make the costs necessary to run at their best quality - whether that be additional teachers, new technology or new books.

To stop our brain drain to the rest of the United Kingdom and the Republic, it is vital that we invest in free tuition for students here, to incentivise Northern Irish students to stay here rather than move elsewhere for education and likely, stay there. Indeed, the fact that tuition is free in Northern Ireland for everyone, not just students from Northern Ireland, means that we could see an opposite effect - more students from Scotland, Wales and England moving here for education. If we want to build a strong economy into the future, this is an investment we have to make.

And this Executive is delivering more for rural infrastructure than just schools. We’re also investing in expanding rural healthcare services - from hospitals, to eldercare, gender identity clinics, ambulance services and more GPs. One part of this rural healthcare plan means offering higher wages for GPs in rural areas, so they continue to work in their communities and be the one of the central figures in those towns and villages again.

This Executive will abolish fares on our public transport systems. In doing so, we will not only take away a major cost in the lives of many people living in Northern Ireland today, it will form a major part of our strategy to take on climate change. Public transport shall always be the cheapest form of transport available to people here, and thus preferable to the car, especially in urban areas. To compensate for the increased demand expected due to public transport becoming free to use, we are allocating extra funds to Translink for the purpose of increasing capacity on existing transport systems.

Furthermore, this Executive is investing in expanding Northern Ireland’s rural bus network by thousands of miles, running hundreds more buses all across the country along many lines ranging from Derry to Newry and Fermanagh to the Causeway Coast. We will aim to have these buses be electric ones where feasible, but due to the large distances traveled it may be necessary to use conventional buses along some lines. Bus stops along these lines will be built to be accessible to all, with locations to shelter from the rain, park your bicycles and proper lighting for the early and late hours of the day.

2. Imo if finance isn't an issue, go for classes. Sure they might not give you the attention they give toppers, but any attention is better than none at all. The peer group and schedule are the most important things a class provides imo. Had it not been for the company of my friends, I would have slacked off faster than you can blink.

Urshilikai,"Joining late, shouting into the void what's been on my mind since 2015. Coincidentally when I went bearish on the stock market and lost an astounding amount of money--I'm biased that the fed cost me this 6 figure sum but will absolutely eat this loss if it was somehow for the utilitarian good. However I believe that fed policy since 2015 (and well before that) has not been for the greater good.

What is the official federal mandate: presently it is ""price"" stability and minimizing unemployment. Though I'm not seeing how current fed policy is enabling these goals at the present moment, given that inflation is correlated with future reduction in GDP and higher inequality (Gini coefficient) \[[https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.295.848&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.295.848&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf)\]. Nor do I think that ""reduce unemployment"" is actually a noble goal, given the material conditions of US capitalism where the vast majority of jobs are necessarily exploitative AND the implied effect of workers having less bargaining power via wage stagnation through permanently low unemployment. These goals instead bolster the status quo, reduce likelihood of social unrest, and empower the owners of financial capital.

The fed was formed in 1913 in response to a series of bank runs in which the fed would backstop all deposits of private banks--an actual noble goal to protect people from the excesses of capitalism. Note the absence of the dual mandate that is cited today, which was only formalized in the 1970s in response the inflation of the 60s-70s \[[https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.295.848&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.295.848&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf)\]. Coincidentally, this was a time when the value productive labor of the middle class decoupled from their earnings--there were many changes occurring during this period and I don't argue this is the sole cause but a likely contributor and an indicator of things to come. 

Jumping back to the present, what is the fed attempting to materially accomplish with its policy? I believe that the fed is, in a very real sense, living up to its compositional makeup: an unelected quasi-governmental organization with a revolving door to private financial institutions (Goldman Sachs) among the senior management: I imply that it attempts to straddle goals involving maintaining the status quo of the government (duopoly stability) to the benefit of financial systemic power. Viewed through this lens, what do low interest rates, the bond purchase program, exploding overnight repo, and novel collaboration with the US treasury accomplish? 

The low interest rates have been a hallmark of the fed since the identification of the Phillips curve which is an inverse relationship between WAGE inflation and unemployment. Right off the bat the assumption that PRICE inflation = WAGE inflation is only weakly supported (pointing straight at the flat line of inflation-adjusted wages since 1970, not even getting into the subject of shadow inflation stats that include things like housing/healthcare/education in the proportion that they are consumed). 

Low interest rates incentivize taking on debt at increasingly poor rates of return (often for 30 year duration). This is why it's often termed as ""pulling future consumption to the present"". Unless that investment has expressly forward-looking anti-externality intentions, it will be used to satisfy present vices. For consumers this includes things like houses, cars, credit cards. For banks its the same thing, but they can front run you--and profit from fees along the way. That's not entirely true, since banks can use debt in a variety of other creative ways in order to satisfy the ""multiple"" that all undergraduate economists are taught is king. A large fraction of this institutional debt-fueled speculation goes into bonds and stocks, but does so quasi-indiscriminately (or not so indiscriminately in the case of pump and dumps or debt-supported share buybacks). This is an oversimplification (though I don't pretend to know the vast networks and web-like avenues through which private capital can presently subvert utilitarian good--neither do I believe that even those in power do). The end result, that I hope most people can grasp intuitively, is that people and private companies have been forced to borrow cheap debt in order to stay afloat. Who wins when the bill comes due? This is the long game that I think the financial elite are playing at: benefiting from wage slavery on the way up, and hoping to benefit from the debt slavery on the way down. Cheap debt (and the trend of even cheaper future debt) creates perverse incentive structures to knowingly borrow as much as you can today assuming that you can borrow even more tomorrow. I disagree with this incentive structure at every level, and with the outcomes it produces--it benefits the riskiest gamblers to the detriment of savers. I don't believe that infinite risk tolerance should be rewarded. 

The bond purchase program is where things really started to decouple for me. I don't know if it existed prior to the covid era, but that's when it seemed to take off. Rather than the fed manipulating the US government-issued interest rate (which is backstopped against default by the US monopoly on violence AKA the military) which sets the rock-bottom floor of rates upon which other debt is measured, they started buying corporate debt. This later exploded during the early part of the covid crash and quite literally saved vast swaths of industries (cruise lines I'm looking at you) from annihilation. I'm torn here, because this may have been an actual positive benefit of the fed to stop financial ruin in the span of 3 months during the original lockdown--granted it was an environment of their own creation after nonstop QE since 2009 where no company was incentivized to hold a rainy day fund. Given that backdrop, I actually think the response to covid was warranted--BUT IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN if we had in mind geological time-scale investment horizons leading up to it. Let's be real, the earth is finite. Finance and the fed must be forced to play by these rules. Bond buying sets a horrible precedent for direct action by the government/fed to prop up zombie companies. 

The overnight repo and US treasury collaboration further extend what I believe are extremely dangerous limits of fed power. The former is an inverse measure of financial institutions willingness to lend to each other. Banks typically will lend to each other overnight to cover withdrawals, under the assumption that not all banks have net withdrawals each day (i.e. a run on the entire banking system in which the fed should guarantee). The rate of lending between banks is determined by perceived risk of default. It should speak volumes that financial institutions are unwilling to lend to each other. Who has the hot potato? Lehman? Evergrande? The addition of the US treasury, headed by previous fed chairwoman Janet Yellen and underscoring the revolving door among financial institutions, only solidifies the picture in my mind that shit is fucked behind the scenes. And yet we aren't addressing the root causes of this instability which is leveraged debt beyond comprehension (quadrillions, orders of magnitude larger than world GDP via derivatives contracts).

One could interpret the theme of this post as consistent with the feds most recent stated goal of long-running average 2% inflation since at its surface appears to be a fairly reasonable amount of inflation for those who took on unproductive debt without harming savers. While this is obviously bullshit in practice today given the real inflation in the past year has been in the neighborhood of 15%. Even if its ""transitory"" we should be gunning for no inflation for nearly a decade based on the last year alone (throw in real inflation since the 90s and the fed should keep the dollar flat for a century per their stated goal...). I'm not aware of any material the fed publishes that corroborates their models or predictions from which they derive policy, and so I can only come to the conclusion that this is BS. The number is fake, the goals are fake, the methods are increasingly fake. However I actually like this \~1-2% number which is the apparent inflation-adjusted growth of productivity. And that's important to account for if the goal of a currency is to keep pace with real economic efficiency. However I don't trust an institution to manage this, and instead we should be dismantling the the government and private systems of power that could even conceive of controlling such a number. We should also be simplifying and dismantling the complexity of the financial system (e.g. mortgages cannot be repackaged and sold to the greater idiot at 10x leverage because neither derivatives nor leverage should exist). If Wall Street wants liquidity,force them to trade in the direct commodities themselves and nothing else. Also decommodify necessities.

Greenmachine881,"\&gt;I haven't read Mosler's proposal. Got a link?

[https://www.huffpost.com/entry/proposals-for-the-banking\_b\_432105](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/proposals-for-the-banking_b_432105) 

\&gt;I suspect that it's mostly about making the system formally what it is in real life and making it clear to all parties (elected reps, appointed boards, etc.) what their roles and authorities are.

No, it's hard core interest rate, money creation, banking regulation.  Note that he assumes in the reader a detailed and expansive knowledge of the fixed income financial markets and govt finance.  A concise statement such as ""banks cannot sell loans"" have sweeping implications - with four words he wiped out Fannie Mae and all GSE backed bonds, which is $8T market today.  [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL404090405Q](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL404090405Q)

However he does leave out some important things: What about the corporate bond market? You need a bank for money creation to underwrite the bond, is that ""selling"" a loan? So you start carving out a lot of exceptions.  What about brokerage margin? etc etc.

It's definitely radical, I'll give him that.  I think one key realization is that in this zero short rate environment, banks will end up paying zero on deposits and will have no risk of losing those deposits (fed covers them unlimited) or having short rates rise and inverting the yield curve - every bankers waking nightmare.  So in banking parlance, zero interest rate risk, zero funding risk.  Bankers do one thing and one thing only: Analyze credit, and then eat their own dogfood.

\&gt;The dollar is already a computer entry at the Fed backed by absolutely zilch. 

Yes and no.  Dollars are computer entries at the sum of all financial institutions worldwide, and they are backed by debt.  Some of that debt is US govt debt (but not all there are plenty corporate and household debt) and the US govt portion of that debt is backed by zilch.  The non-govt portion is backed by land, buildings, corporate assets.  A distinction of this difference is that US govt makes coupon payments to non-govt entities and for them that is ""real money"" in the sense of profits, dividends, paying staff, buying fancy buildings.

\&gt; Backed by X, would means that it can be exchanged for X. It can't be exchanged for anything but itself.

Today it can be exchanged for debt securities and vice versa pretty easily, You have a fed note in your hand, you stand on a street corner waive it in the air, someone drives by and hands you a piece of paper signed by secretary of the treasury tilted ""Bond indenture agreement"", you take that and give up the dollar bill - you've exchanged it for something and vice versa.  Both paper are meaningless promises backed by nothing but the financial terms are very different (one carries coupon).  Because of that their relative exchange values fluctuate.

Gikkio_,"&gt;I mean, that all may be true of many games, and to a good degree people will leave this game just because they’ve gotten their enjoyment out of it. But in this case, the game is just pushing people away and killing itself. The publishers are greedy, trying to squeeze every cent out of the player base, and don’t want to put any money into their servers. And the devs don’t care to actually balance their game any more, releasing one OP unit after another, and never properly addressing hero balance. Those are the real reasons this game has declined so quickly.

Totally agree with you. But take for example soft houses like EA, or like others. They offer the same game every year, investing in microtransactions that have now become true ""gambling"" for the very young.

They made a game, a game where I only spent the money for 1 skin that I don't even use, just to finance the project.It is true that they are trying to ""get the last drops of milk from the old cow"", it is understandable because I do not think they will reinvest in the game.The ingame choices are completely wrong, but they are due to the COMMON RULES OF MARKETING. ;) 

1. Attract people with affordable prices
2. Create a community and make the product known
3. When the life curve of the product is at the right point, squeeze every remaining money and close the project. It's the world that goes like this unfortunately so I don't feel upset with them because for FREE they gave me a nice gaming experience shared with friends.

jbrev01,"I'm not going to go over the risks in crypto. There are many. You can research yourself on how to stay sufficiently safe. As far as defi projects going bust or beings scams, stick to the big names, popular defi projects with large TVL (total value locked). My advice to stay safe in terms of crypto security are to only and always use a hardware wallet. Always keep control of your own crypto, don't leave it sitting in an exchange wallet or wallet that you don't control the private keys. Again, USE A HARDWARE WALLET ONLY. I've seen way too many people losing their crypto in defi from using browser wallets only.

There is a chance that some stablecoins will go to zero. DAI is a decentralized stablecoin that has proven itself in big market crashes (somewhat). I hear UST Terra is another decentralized algorithmic stablecoin that is better than DAI, but the only project that offers it is I think Uniswap, but I'm doing everything on Polygon at the moment. USDT Tether is high risk as the company that issues tether is not transparent and has never allowed an audit of their finances. There are also rumors that if Evergrande defaults on their debts, this can cause tether to collapse (which would be very, very bad for all of crypto, and the worldwide economy). USDC is probably the safest stablecoin as it is audited and somewhat transparent. So Curve finance has a stablecoin pool that is split between USDC, USDT and DAI, that's a way to hedge your bets. But again, I'm staying far away from tether. All of my stablecoins are in USDC as I'm confident the circle that issues them (Circle) won't go bust.

I actually only keep very little in stablecoins, only a few months living expenses as I am not confident at all in government fiat currencies like the US Dollar. They are losing their value quickly and it is only going to accelerate. The governments and central banks think they can manage and control this, but history and logic says otherwise.

I currently keep most of my wealth stored in crypto and silver. So most of my defi pools are in crypto, not stablecoins. Mainly ETH at the moment.",2021-10-23 19:43:58
GrilledCheezzy,"I mean I get what the recipe for this is - deflationary, newer coin but really the same contract with minor changes, shill the ever living fuck out of it and just be all positive like fan boys. It sort of works if you all do it and it just catches the hype train but it really adds nothing to DeFi. I’ll shill you on what I’m especially interested in right now. 

Visor finance - earn unsiwap fees from as strategically managed pools in v3. Being used by newer projects to properly manage their pools and token releases on uniswap v3. Also uses the erc721 standard as vault for LP coins which is fairly new in DEX projects. 

convex finance - it pools and locks CRV in curve to share a boosted APY higher than you would get alone and manages LP for multiple DEX apps. 

Arcx - passport credit score NFTs which will result in specialized farming, LP opportunities and airdrops  based on uou transaction history

Dydx exchange - I leverage trade on Dydx which is on side chain so avoid ethereum fees. 

Earned 200$ in first week APY in convex. You can also earn Dydx token rewards based on the amount of fees you pay to the LPs for borrowing in trades.  I’ve earned over 4000$ in Dydx tokens this epoch.  I did post a similar tweet to this comment but I don’t really have to shill my investments in order for them to succeed.

mia6ix,"I’m with you on everything, except the enormous and unnecessary leap you’re making to imply that the Wu-Tang album will be fractionalized as an NFT dividend for GME shareholders. I’ve been seeing this logical leap all over all the GME subs today, like apes are going to own a piece of this album, and it makes no sense. If you entirely remove that from your argument, your argument is much improved. 

For instance, change this one sentence: 

“Fractionalized NFTs mean they can break the asset (the priceless album)…” to “Fractionalized NFTs mean they can break the asset (the GME NFT dividend)…” and you have a great argument. 

There is literally no need for this specific album to be the asset that becomes the GME NFT dividend. Any NFT can be fractionalized, or a series of NFTs exactly matching the number of official shares could be created, and both of these would be just as impossible for broker/dealers to acquire for counterfeit shares. 

What the Wu-Tang and PleasrDAO situation reveals to us is

1. Ryan Cohen is almost certainly the hooded person in the PleasrDAO photo. 

(See https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qe2h3w/please_flick_through_pictures_and_connect_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)


This tells us he’s WAY ahead of the curve in bleeding-edge blockchain applications, which lets us know that a crypto/NFT dividend, or an entirely blockchain-based stock market, is something on his radar and totally within his wheelhouse. It validates what we’ve learned about the GameStop NFT project, the collaboration with Loopring, and GMERICA. It lends support to the idea that GMERICA will be or is already a DAO. 

2. PleasrDAO members appear to be aware of the unfolding situation with GameStop. 

(See https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qdsr4r/the_nft_which_will_hit_the_scene_like_a_bomb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf )

The references in the media interview with pplpleasr and the references to apes on their site indicate this. This is seriously bullish for us. If you haven’t checked out the PleasrDAO membership, it’s a who’s who of crypto innovators. https://pleasr.org/

The reason I do not think that the Wu-Tang album itself is related to GameStop is because this album is owned by PleasrDAO, not by Ryan Cohen. PleasrDAO has 74 members who now own this album together, and many of them are BFDs in DeFi (decentralized finance). There is no reason to assume that these stakeholders in this valuable asset are going to break up this asset to deliver fractionalized “shares” of it specifically to GameStop stockholders. That’s the huge leap I’m talking about. It makes no sense. PleasrDAO owns a lot of valuable NFTs. Their mission statement is about decentralized, community ownership of digital art. 

The connection we should be making is that RC’s involvement with PleasrDAO is evidence that he knows *exactly* how to leverage DAO concepts and fractionalized NFTs to potentially revolutionize the stock market as we know it - and he will perhaps do that in exactly the way you’ve described (minus the part about distributing a priceless album as a fractionalized NFT).  

Any NFT dividend issued by GameStop will *become* priceless the very second broker-dealers realize they can’t fulfill their legal obligation to provide said dividend to all the clients who have GME in their portfolios.",2021-10-24 04:26:08

7. Boost has taken elements from Uniswap, SushiSwap, ParaSwap, Bancor, Balancer, Dodo Exchange, and Curve Finance to create a full-functioning backend. They have added advanced functions, such as a Limit order function, which will enable users to set a predetermined price at which they are willing to execute a swap. In future iterations, they will also be infusing features that can only be accessed by Boost Coin holders and some subscription based features requiring Boost Coin exclusively as payment.
BoostSwap will have a 0.3% swap fee which will be directly contributed to the Boost Coin liquidity pool, thus increasing the value of Boost Coin with every transaction performed on BoostSwap, regardless of which tokens or coins are exchanged.
Also they will be establishing numerous partnerships with new projects being launched on the Ethereum network. These partnerships will be both revenue generating and provide additional marketing and outreach. The revenue will also be added to the liquidity pool of Boost coin, further increasing its value.

1to14to4,"You can read the CBO report on this.

https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56910

While the outlook is bad, the issue isn't raising interest rates right now. It's going to happen and there is no stopping it. The 10 year will rise on its own as the yield curve steepens. 

But the fact is the issue isn't rising interest rates right now and the Fed raising rates. We will come back almost in line with servicing costs relative to GDP according to the CBO. The issue is the long-term spending projections and expansion of the debt. As the final bullet point on the presentations say.

&gt;Growth of Net Interest Outlays. In CBO’s most recent projections, the cumulative deficit from 2021 through 2030 totals nearly $13 trillion. Borrowing to finance that deficit—at a time when interest rates are expected to rise—would cause net interest payments as a percentage of GDP to increase over that period, from 1.4 percent to 2.2 percent, which is generally in line with the 50-year average of 2.0 percent. Over the long term, interest rates are projected to rise further, and the amount of debt issued is projected to grow, causing net outlays for interest to increase to about 8 percent of GDP by 2050.

So no - no one with knowledge of these projections thinks that rising interest rates right now would have a ""threat""ening effect to the stability of the economy. Or else you'd have no one arguing for it - and there are plenty of people arguing for raising rates.

Edit: that doesn't mean there isn't some political tilt here. Some people (and possibly Powell) want to keep rates low to fund the current spending package, which probably will be funding over time through a wide variety of different duration bonds. But that also doesn't mean rising interest rates is unstabalizing... just dangerous because it leads to the debt growing faster.",2021-10-24 13:59:36
RimkeV,"Mentioned mine a few times before but...

Rewards from bank accounts - Halifax and Barclays. Got Lloyds too but it's not monetary.
£8 a month. (Double this as partner does same)

Only surveys I do is on Premise, started this month and only surveys I can stand, should easily pass £10. (Double again for partner)

Serpclix - Roughly £10 a month give or take but due to work, lots of times when not at my computer, it's easy enough to do though. (Partner does around the same)

Use to do AMEX/Nectar/Tesco points, if spending big I'll still use AMEX. Jump on any spend promos, where possible shop via BA Shopping Portal, insure my fake cat for it to die for bonus points etc... weekly shop at Sainsbury's anyway so still collect points, would say I do around £10 a month.

Like I said above, use to do a lot on the cards but recently switched to Crypto.com card for the 2% cashback (in CRO) and Spotify, only started it the other week but spent lots of time on the sub and learning to get the most out of it.
Link it to a Curve card, then both you and your partner can use the same card, creating more cashback faster.
Annoyingly once you load up the card with money, apparently you can't withdraw the money off the card so yet again, use Curve, spend on a normal credit card via Curve and end of the month, add up what you've spent and get Curve to move it the CDC card once you've loaded up the correct amount.

If people don't fancy using crypto card and staking £300, Chase is offering 1% cashback for a year.

Just started holding stable coins for the high interest, expected £8 back this month from that, compound it and put back in for a month etc...
Looking at liquidity pools still.

Got 1 Helium miner that's on week 3 that's generated $112 so far.
Got 3 more helium miners to come.

My AWAIR monitor is coming for PlanetWatch.io that should hopefully bring in $2k a year but obviously coin price can fluctuate. May by more of these, we'll see.
Tempted to flip 2 of the Helium miners and get the Aquino Type 1 from PlanetWatch.

I work continental shifts, average around 13 days a month so if weather nice and not got much on, I'll jump on my bike and do a bit of Deliveroo/UberEats, anywhere between £100 - 150 a month, maybe a bit less this last month, don't mind the cold and rain but the wind is crippling at times 🤣

I basically use the beermoney offers to help finance ways of making more money.
Other day I went through and did all the invest/loan offers, for an investment of £35, I'll get that back minus/plus how the investment went plus £65 in referral money, should come end of Jan and start of Feb.

Next week I'll start on any crypto offers I've yet to do because I got lazy, think around 7 or 8, obviously some you have to hold for a while.

I'll then use my partner's info and refer her to them all with my referral so treble the returns of any offer.
Any MatchBetters with multiple accounts courtesy of family and friends can do this.

My advice, if you got a partner, get them on board or at least get their info and set it all up.

cherry-pick-me,"Thanks op for starting this! Thanks to everyone for sharing how they make money online!

If you are un undergrad (Uni student who doesn't necessarily study on the Uni's campus; eg distance/online learning), you can get free council tax depending on the number of credits and your local council rules.

For me, the most money I made referring through the Cash App until they closed my account. 

Now, I use Topcashback and Quidco whenever I can to get cashback (utilities, airport car park, ebay, mobile and broadband, home insurance etc)

I also try to cook more often, and be more mindful when shopping about what I need vs what I want (AKA stay away from impulse buying). I know this doesn't give you any money per se, but it can make a meaningful difference in the way you spend the money you have (which often is not a lot to start with!). 

Cutting down on unnecessary subscriptions or trials can also help! Say if you used to use your gym so many times per week, or watch Netflix so often in a week, but no longer have time for that due to current commitments, if can be sensible to simply cancel them if they no longer provide value for money to you.

I haven't tried matched betting, but it seems that you can make money like many have said and posted, and if you follow the rules properly. 

Another point is that some of these offers (bank switches, credit cards etc) can impact your credit history (in particular in the short term). While this may not matter, it can be detrimental if you are looking to secure a loan, car finance or mortgage in the near term (say next 12 months or so). 

And many offers seem to just lure customers with a dangling carrot, and then they are soon pulled out or the apps completely disappear, eg Emma, Cleo, Verse (due to Brexit), Curve (keep changing their referral terms) and on and on... Sometimes, it's not even worth to effort so yeah, I feel like it's quite difficult to make any decent money on a regular basis. Especially now, when the offers seem to have thinned out significantly due to Covid crisis and everything else...

As for survey offers, I personally don't have an inclination. I think Swagbucks simply has put me off from trying others.",2021-10-24 20:06:53
Whale_Poacher,"Capitalism does not need to be ruthless, anticompetitive, or existent as free market capitalism. Your analogy is full on mouth garbage. We’re all participants in capitalism, it’s not like saying whatever the fuck you’re saying. I don’t know what kind of approach you’re taking, but my expertise is in marxism and finance, what I’ve studied the most in school and have degrees in. You seem to lack knowledge on how funds for such things are raised and distributed for the building and maintaining of those buildings. They exist in a capitalist system and are maintained through taxation in a capitalist system. I don’t know if you’re proposing socialism instead, but I’d rather have high meat prices then bread lines and no opportunity to move in life. Capitalism proposes that others can make decisions about whether something is worth it to them and if enough decide alternatives to rising meat prices are a better opportunity they will seek them. Price fixing is a mechanism that involves colluding and acting in a way that hurts others and manipulates a supply and demand curve. Capitalism is not a zero sum game and your throwing big words at me as if I don’t understand the mechanics of capitalism isn’t really a proper response to why meat prices are being MANIPULATED beyond what equilibrium should be on a demand curve.",2021-10-25 01:34:00
handsomeboh,"There are lots of economic theories on personal finance. Chief among them is the Permanent Income Hypothesis as developed by Friedman in the 50s. It quite simply posits that the most efficient way to plan your expenditure is consumption smoothing. As long as you have the same diminishing marginal utility curve in each period, then the optimal strategy is always to split up your consumption equally in every period.

However, your income is not constant, and so you need to forecast your future earnings and consume the average of that in each period. In practice, that means you should consume more than you earn when you're younger by taking debt, and pay off that debt when you're older. We sort of do this already with car loans and mortgages, but it basically tells us that not being in debt is economically inefficient.

On top of this we can also stack theories on precautionary savings. This posits that your savings should be proportionate to your uncertainty. This means you should save less when uncertainty decreases, like when you buy insurance.

There's a whole field of study here that includes multiple other theories like intertemporal choice theory, and many facets of portfolio construction theory.",2021-10-25 07:56:11
Whawken84,"A billion dollars a year is return on an investment which wasn't originally created to make any profit other than having a better educated workers and citizens.

""If a degree isn't worth a $30,000 investment, why get one?""  My perspective, looking back to the public universities pre dating the 1862 Morrill Act (ex Mich. State U was founded 1855) is that public higher education should be accessible. 30Gs on a 22 year old's shoulders is a lot of money. Not everyone has supportive or money savvy parents / guardians. That debt can influence every decision made by this young adult. And many mistakes. We all make bad decisions. Often we make more not -so -great decisions when we're young &amp; less experienced. Many new grads get low paying jobs to start or unpaid ""internships"" (which I think are a cruel joke). 22 year olds often don't have a career mapped out. And today's good idea of a profession might be outdated quickly due to technological change. Repeating myself, most grads &amp; parents are not that well versed in finance. Parents may be working in jobs and school and are exhausted when they get home - being a health care worker was exhausting before COVID. The big debt discourages many potential students from applying for college. Graduates may go straight to grad school in order to manage that debt - or avoid immediately confronting it,  only to find that they hate their chosen field or are ill suited for it despite grades &amp; test scores.

I agree w/ you about the history of skyrocketing educational costs. IMO, it became a racket. 

IMO Parent Plus Loans are best for parents who don't really have a financial need for Parent Plus Loans or know their kid is the next Stephen Hawking, Cheryl Sandberg or (fill in the blank). Parents are often just finished with or are still paying their own student loans. Parents need to save for their own retirement. The kids  won't be able to support them as they, too will still be paying loans and the grandkids will be needing student loans before the lis are done with payment - making them The Sandwich Generation. .Since most pensions are a thing of the past and 401Ks / 403Bs, while portable, usually don't have the same financial benefit for the average middle class or working person. this adds more financial &amp; emotional stress. Too much temptation to take money out for life's necessities or emergencies beyond the emergency fund. Life throws us curve balls: catastrophic illness, natural disasters, unwanted unemployment.

Gravely_Chill,"Here is my own breakdown of all the courses I have taken or am currently taking and with which professor.  Enjoy!!!

BUSOBA 2321 (Dickstein) I’m in now and it is just annoying.  I did pretty bad on his exam, but there is a built in curve and, on top of that another curve that gets implemented if students do so bad.  Basically, the course material, weekly quizzes, and cases are easy, but the exams are just painful and confusing to study for.  They do not run on proctorio, however it still is terrible.

BUSOBA 2320 (Draper) was not as bad imo.  There was so much extra credit to take advantage of that you should be able to pull an A as long as you do it all.  The cases are more involved, but are super easy if you go to office hours.

BUSML 3250 (Norton) is the same deal as stats.  The exams are difficult, but in my case as long as you pull an 85 the curves and extra credit should take it up to an A.  

BUSML 3380 (Esper) was another annoying course.  There are so few points in the class that if you miss one quiz your grade can drop significantly.  I thought I did bad on the exam, but it turned out he curved it so much that I ended pulling an A.

BUSFIN 3220 (Clark) is mostly self paced as far as I’m concerned.  You have to do your due diligence and stay current with the material yourself.  The exams were average as far as difficulty, but you do have to really study for them.

BUSMHR 3200 (Buchanan) has difficult exams that are weighted heavily.  Just really study for them and stay current with the material.  The work outside the exams is super easy.

BUSFIN 3500 (Helmreich) I can’t really comment on yet since that course just started for me, however I heard this course isn’t too bad compared to the others.

BUSOBA 3230 (Lundregan) is more math heavy than I anticipated.  The required lectures and recitations force you to stay current with the material.  The math isn’t difficult, its just a different kind of math like finance and statistics.  So far, this class has been one of the most organized at fisher for me.

BUSMHR 2000 (Corredoira) was super easy.

I had transfer credit for the two accounting courses, but I hear I dodged a bullet with those.  If you have any questions let me know.",2021-10-26 09:28:02
TsotyliBoi,"Then, and I’ll elaborate, don’t do anything you don’t have a drive to do.

I wanted to be ahead of the curve so I’d ask this question. Everyone said the same thing, “enjoy your college time” One senior manager actually gave me something to do. He gave me a textbook to read to learn and understand real estate finance (bc thats what I wanted). Even with my drive and interest, I never got past page 10 lmao. Did it affect me in any way? Not one bit.

However I make the point of do what drives you because sometimes you genuinely *want* to do “professional” things in your free-time and you shouldn’t feel bad about that. I started a consulting firm my senior year cuz I was interested in it and the opportunity presented itself. That went on to be the most asked thing on my resume (I was even in the army lol) and what got me to land Deloitte, Amazon, and so on. So if you do in fact have a drive to do something related, then go for it cuz it’ll only help your chances of success. Not doing anything career-related, and simply chilling and enjoying college, will also help your chances of success. Just do you 🥸",2021-10-26 10:57:00

panzerpanda,Locking up curve tokens gives you voting power for curve gauges which can massively boost apr on the lps on curve. Average lock up is 3.5 years and 88% of circulating curve is currently locked. Supply shock is a thing since convex finance started incentivizing people to stake their crv with them and lock it up forever. Convex will soon own the curve  weight gauge vote by itself. Dyor on that dope ass protocol with its staking and bribing system for curve weight gauges by locking cvx tokens. It’s a lot more complicated but I’ve made a retard huge amount of money off of both. Plus ~60% apr on your staked cvxcrv and ~50-55% on locked cvx with bribes taken into account is fucking choice shit.,2021-10-26 22:41:14

That's a pretty decent tutorial for convex, getting into the Curve pools is a bit complicated but it's worth knowing how to do because the yields are so high. It's worth mentioning that this form of yield farming is a bit riskier than regular yield farming on PCS or whatever but so far there haven't been any real problems with impermanent loss and TVL has been consistently exploding since Convex launched. Hope the article helps.",2021-10-26 23:54:06

This is a better explanation than I could give because I'm not very tech savvy. When you deposit into Curve LP's you have the option to lock up your LP token long term (4 years or so) in exchange for a drastically higher yield.

 So what Convex does is it takes your Curve LP token and locks it up in the Curve Guage for you and you get a Convex LP token in exchange. So now you're receiving boosted Curve rewards and also Convex finance rewards on your Convex LP token, which results in a significantly higher yield than simply using Curve. You can withdraw your assets from the Convex LP at any time, so you get the benefits of locking up your liquidity long term without actually having to lock it up for any time at all. It's great.

Also, you can stake Curve Dao token for 64 percent APR on Convex (comes out to around 80% APY by compounding like every other month). There are also BTC and ETH pegged pools that allow you to get a really solid yield on your BTC or ETH with a minimal risk of impermanent loss and you can't really find that anywhere else. Maybe Balancer but I'm not positive. Hope this helps.",2021-10-27 00:05:57
Sardonac,"Graduating isn't the goal, graduating with a degree that gives you a decent return on investment is.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if you end up not liking the fields that are super relevant to your field of engineering, engineering and similar STEM majors tend to be fairly robust academically, which gives you more options to find work in other fields. This is why you see engineers who end up working in finance, project management, whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

In your position I would consider going part time. If going part time and lowering your course load means that you do better but end up graduating a little later, that is a fair trade off and will build your self confidence. I would also keep in mind that engineering academics tends to be very front loaded in difficulty. There is a harsh initial learning curve that forces you to adapt to the workload. By the time you're in late sophomore/junior year you're more comfortable with your new 'normal' workload and can handle the stress a little better. Don't beat yourself up too much, you can definitely handle the engineering workload if you manage it at your pace.",2021-10-27 00:21:12

3. Not sure but not easy i think. Bell curve has people getting 100s

4. GPA at the Uni stage? Would be important for masters and for work. Dont think masters is required as not many of my friends went on to do masters. I think its not good to be overqualified when you just start work too. Youd want some working exp under your belt to get a good lay. 

GPA likely affects your choice of exchange. Before covid, i think everyone was guaranteed a slot. But your GPA would affect your chances if other people applied for the same slot.

NoFrontiers,"A l'heure où le Livret A ne rapporte plus que 0,50 %, un courtier enregistré auprès de l'Autorité des marchés financiers lance un placement au « rendement garanti » de 5 %. Est-ce une réelle alternative aux livrets d'épargne classiques ?  
Un livret à 5 % : l'annonce du courtier en cryptomonnaies Coinhouse, enregistré auprès de l'Autorité des marchés financiers, a de quoi susciter la curiosité. A l'heure où le Livret A ne rapporte plus que 0,50 % , comment est-il possible de servir 10 fois plus aux investisseurs sur un livret d'épargne ? Si l'argent magique n'existe pas, les rendements magiques non plus. Un produit ayant stricto sensu les mêmes caractéristiques qu'un livret à savoir la liquidité, un rendement plutôt stable et un capital garanti ne peut pas servir un tel taux dans les conditions actuelles de marché.  
D'ailleurs, bien qu'il soit baptisé « Livret Crypto USDT », « ce n'est pas un livret d'épargne » de l'aveu même du directeur commercial de Coinhouse Romain Saguy. Première différence : il n'est que partiellement liquide. Alors que l'argent sur un Livret A est disponible à tout moment, les fonds confiés à Coinhouse sont bloqués durant les 13 premières semaines qui suivent la souscription. « A l'issue de ces 3 mois, le client peut sortir quand il le veut. Il recevra le rendement annuel au prorata de son temps d'investissement », explique Romain Saguy, directeur commercial de Coinhouse . En l'occurrence, un taux de 5 % annuel correspond à une rémunération de 1,25 % après 13 semaines.  
Capital non garanti  
Plus fondamental encore, le capital sur le livret de Coinhouse n'est pas couvert alors que les dépôts sur un livret bancaire classique sont protégés indépendamment du contexte économique ou de marché. Le courtier ne garantit pas à l'épargnant qu'il retrouve la totalité de l'argent déposé. Il s'engage seulement sur le versement des intérêts.  
Ce produit n'est donc pas dénué de risques, ce que n'occulte pas Coinhouse. Dans la fiche d'information accompagnant ce produit, le courtier évalue à 3 sur 7 le risque de ce placement, 1 signifiant pour Coinhouse que le risque est faible, 7 qu'il est très fort. Bien qu'elle reprenne les codes du SRRI, l'indice financier courant qui permet de mesurer le niveau de volatilité d'un placement (1), cette échelle de risque est propre à Coinhouse, fait remarquer Philippe Maupas, consultant financier et auteur du blog alphabetablog. Elle n'est ainsi pas comparable par exemple au SRRI d'un fonds immobilier, très souvent noté 3 sur 7. Il semble effectivement que les risques attachés à ce nouveau produit soient nettement plus élevés.  
3 Risque majeurs  
En l'occurrence, les risques du Livret Crypto USDT liés aux sous-jacents de ce placement sont au nombre de trois : contrepartie, piratage et change.  
Concrètement, pour générer 5 % de rendement, Coinhouse prête les cryptomonnaies de ses clients via les outils de finance décentralisée. En résumé, il s'agit de sortes de plateformes de crowdfunding en mode crypto, c'est-à-dire régies par un protocole informatique.  
« Cela fait 18 mois à 2 ans que la finance décentralisée existe, mais c'est complexe techniquement pour un investisseur seul. Certaines plateformes ne sont pas accessibles en dessous de 2 millions investis. Les taux sont variables d'un jour à l'autre, cela peut-être 8 % une journée, 4 % une autre. Il faut se montrer réactif et réallouer ses fonds vers d'autres plateformes si le rendement baisse », détaille Romain Saguy. C'est aussi cette volatilité forte qui fait que Coinhouse peut réviser tous les 3 mois le taux de son livret crypto.  
La finance décentralisée permet notamment à des crypto-investisseurs d'emprunter de la cryptomonnaie pour augmenter la quantité d'argent investi. C'est ce qui génère un effet de levier dans cet univers virtuel. Pour obtenir un prêt, ces investisseurs doivent mettre en collatéral la quantité suffisante de cryptomonnaies pour couvrir leurs éventuelles pertes et rembourser ainsi le prêteur, assure Romain Saguy.

Risques de contrepartie et de piratage  
Mais un risque de contrepartie existe bel et bien, reconnaît le directeur commercial de Coinhouse. « Si on fait une erreur de gestion et que notre investissement génère moins de 5 %, nous assumons la différence. En revanche, si le protocole sur lequel l'argent est placé fait défaut, ce n'est pas du ressort de Coinhouse. Nous minimisons ce risque en faisant appel à des plateformes de premier plan comme FTX qui vient de lever 100 millions de dollars », poursuit Romain Saguy. Sur les 16 supports d'investissement sélectionnés, Coinhouse passe aussi par des applications moins connues comme Curve et Aave.  
« Il y a un risque de fraude », met aussi en garde Philippe Maupas. « Depuis 3 à 6 mois, les affaires de hacking qui sortent dans la presse concernent essentiellement la finance décentralisée », fait également remarquer Mehdi Zouari, expert blockchain et crypto pour le groupe de conseillers en gestion de patrimoine Selexium. Ce dernier préconise aux investisseurs intéressés par la cryptomonnaie de s'exposer très progressivement.  
« Il faut commencer avec quelques centaines d'euros et ne surtout pas clôturer son Livret A destiné à accueillir l'épargne de précaution », explique Mehdi Zouari. S'agissant du placement de Coinhouse, « le ticket d'entrée de 50.000 dollars est très élevé. Ce produit est donc réservé à des investisseurs ayant une capacité d'épargne importante », souligne le porte-parole de Selexium. Coinhouse indique vouloir abaisser prochainement ce montant minimum d'investissement.  
Risque de change  
Enfin, un troisième risque existe : celui de change. En effet, les prêts aux crypto-investisseurs ne s'effectuent pas en euros, mais en stablecoins. Il s'agit d'une cryptomonnaie. Mais à la différence des plus connues, bitcoin et ether, la valeur d'un stablecoin est censée être stable dans le temps, équivalente à une monnaie comme l'euro ou le dollar. En l'occurrence, Coinhouse a choisi le stablecoin tether (USDT).  
Avantage : tant que l'investisseur ne convertit pas ses stablecoins en euros, aucune fiscalité ne s'applique. Inconvénient : comme le tether est indexé sur le dollar, l'investisseur qui mise sur le Livret Crypto USDT de Coinhouse s'expose aux évolutions de la parité euro-dollar. « Cela peut être à son détriment si le dollar s'affaiblit », met en garde Romain Saguy.  
En outre, si le tether est le stablecoin le plus courant, avec une capitalisation qui dépasse les 40 milliards de dollars, le mécanisme de garantie lui permettant de maintenir sa conversion en dollars pose question. Le 15 octobre dernier, le régulateur américain, le CFTC, l'a en effet condamné à payer 41 millions de dollars pour avoir menti sur ses réserves. Interrogé, le porte-parole de Coinhouse se veut rassurant : « le seul fait que Tether ait été mis à l'amende est un signe positif. Cela veut dire qu'ils ont soldé leur contentieux », explique Romain Saguy. Il ajoute néanmoins vouloir prochainement diversifier les stablecoins utilisés.

2) There aren't any sufficiently liquid lending/borrowing markets for wNXM at the moment. While there is a Rari Capital Fuse pool that Reflexer Finance has started, it's not a whitelisted pool yet, so it wouldn't be coverable by Nexus Mutual. I'm not sure how liquid that pool is, but feel free to look on Rari Capital's Fuse pools. 

3) The Nexus community is very aware of the wNXM discount issue. During our community call today, it was discussed extensively. You can see the current forum post on [Solving wNXM discount while maintaining reasonable MCR%](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/solving-wnxm-discount-while-maintaining-reasonable-mcr/683) on the Nexus Mutual forum. Our Investment Hub is also exploring a potential buyback, but there are considerations our community is reviewing before that can happen. 

While the MCR lock issue is very frustrating, the bonding curve is essential for controlling capitalisation levels so the mutual can ensure there's enough capital to payout claims should a loss event occur. 

For more information on the difference between wNXM and NXM or for a breakdown of the mutual's tokenomics, you can review these two links:

Mrs_Frisby,"Speaking of disinfo on this sub - *here is some right here.*

Sinema is legislating exactly as she promised she would in her solid red state.  For example one of her planks was a promise to the people of Arizona that she would not raise taxes. She makes that one regularly and kept it in the House too. 

[https://thehill.com/policy/finance/578102-sinemas-office-outlines-opposition-to-tax-rate-hikes](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/578102-sinemas-office-outlines-opposition-to-tax-rate-hikes)

&gt;Sen. Kyrsten Sinema's office on Friday outlined the senator's opposition to raising tax rates, saying the Arizona Democrat thinks that just increasing rates ""will not in any way address the challenge of tax avoidance or improve economic competitiveness.""

Now the idea that raising taxes is pointless because the rich just avoid them is a popular GOP canard - so I'm not at all surprised to see Arizona voters embracing that bit of laffer curve nonsense.  And of course Senator McCain 2.0 believes this just like McCain 1.0 believed it.  The difference here is that McCain 2.0 isn't voting for McConnell as Senate Majority leader and is confirming Biden's appointments without a fuss as well as getting the Infrastructure bill past the senate and critical bills like the ARP and infrastructure. 

You aren't a progressive if you don't make progress.  Real progressives count their blessings and take the wins we get rather than focusing on the negative.  It keeps your energy up to fight another day.

cinepro,"You just discovered the economic principle of complements and substitution. You would probably get a Nobel Prize for it, if it wasn't already in every Econ 101 textbook.

Because there are a massive number of suppliers for ""food"" and massive competition, there is great supply of ""food"" and prices stay low. Everyone needs ""food"", but not everyone needs ""broccoli"". They might be just as happy with cauliflower, or spinach, or peas. So if all the broccoli farmers increased prices together, people could buy less broccoli. 

You could argue the same is true for housing in a specific area, and to a certain degree, it could be. If all the landlords in Burbank decided to raise rents, people might choose housing in North Hollywood, or Sun Valley. But if all the renters in the valley were getting an extra $1,000/mo, then many would accept higher rents. And since there could be more renters than available units (and few substitute options), prices could rise. 

https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-macroeconomics/basic-economics-concepts-macro/demand/v/price-of-related-products-and-demand

&gt;Complements are goods that are consumed together. Substitutes are goods where you can consume one in place of the other. The prices of complementary or substitute goods also shift the demand curve. When the price of a good that complements a good decreases, then the quantity demanded of one increases and the demand for the other increases. When the price of a substitute good decreases, the quantity demanded for that good increases, but the demand for the good that it is being substituted for decreases.",2021-10-28 23:13:33

Zukoismyhero,"As a woman myself I see where you are coming from. I've always been in the gifted class, I'm working on my 5th degree. I'm a bit ADHD so I've always had a million things going on, lots of hobbies, lost if interests. My boyfriend is a physician and I really love our intellectual conversations about science. I have traveled all over the world, love sociology and the human condition, love primate behavior. Love money, finance, business, real estate. Own a home and garden and do construction, play several instruments etc. Like computers and can fix or build just about anything. I have twin 16 year olds so ive done the mom thing for many years. Through that a million more skills like drawing and dinosaurs and videogames. 

And then sometimes I talk to people and its like they go through life like a rock falling down a hill. Unaware of the vastness of the universe or the flowers they crush. They just... Exist. No opinions no need for legacy. I like to say ""half the people are below average intelligence"" i cope with this by being in the medical field where my colleagues are very intelligent and by proxy interesting. 

However I would argue that this phenomenon of perpetual nothingness is not related to gender, rather it is related to intelligence. Women have an IQ bell curve that tends towards center while men are more spread out. So you get a higher percentage of genius men, fewer females, throw in some confirmation bias and bam... Women are all boring and dumb. However men also outnumber women in areas like special ed classes 4:1. They are more likely to fail out of school and have limited interests such as only porn and videogames, limited emotional range. Also they may talk about things you, as a guy, find more interesting. I can go on for hours about toddlers nap schedules or the role of estrogen in the body but you might find that dull because its not videogame related. 

My point is that you need to look at the breadth of a persons knowledge regardless of its relevance to you in order to decipher their capabilities. Meaning their overall intelligence without confirmation bias. 

Perhaps if you listened instead of waiting for your turn to talk with the assumption they will have nothing to offer you intellectuallly you will have more satisfying conversations, or perhaps, the women in your social circle are of below average intelligence.",2021-10-29 11:25:28

omgouda,"You’re obviously entrepreneurial given that you generated $2.5M in sales. I see some people below mentioned going into tech sales. Example job title would be like account manager. This is a very lucrative field to be in. And once you can sell for one tech company, you can almost always sell for another. These ppl are making six figures easily and from what I understand, this job can be done remotely. 

If you feel like you like accounting, this is also a decent path to go down. It won’t be as lucrative as tech sales in the beginning but if you work hard and make the right connections, you can move into a lot of those ‘sexy’ high finance roles after some experience. You would def need to get a CPA if choosing to be an accountant. More of a time investment for sure. Something to consider if you want to have time with your family. 

Maybe if I was in your position, I would look into tech sales. I can imagine that most of your competition for these roles haven’t sold $2.5m at 22 years old. This puts you way ahead of the curve.
