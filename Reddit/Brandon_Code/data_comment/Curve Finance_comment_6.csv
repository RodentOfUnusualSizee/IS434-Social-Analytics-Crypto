rdtrowz,"As u/UnearnedConfident has mentioned, at your age, the best investment is in yourself. Get a good education and pick up a skill you can sell. Continue to develop this skill as this will mainly how you earn money and capital to invest (for most people anyway). More than this, take this time to get more educated on other topics on financial planning - learn to have a budget, emergency cash, manage debt and loans, credit cards, develop your credit, taxes, retirement accounts, get health insured, etc. Investing your money should come after you've got all these fundamentals right.

Dave Ramsay is a good starting point to get these fundamentals, but I''ve heard his stuff on investing are not all that great (don't quote me!). Avoid the Rich Dad Poor Dad book, I'll summarize it for you in one sentence - Buy assets that generate wealth, avoid assets that don't. The entire book goes on and on about this concept and doesn't really teach you anything else that is meaningful. It felt like I was waiting and waiting for a reveal that did not come even as I ended the book.

The PersonalFinance sub wiki has really good general guide on what to focus on for people of various age groups: [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/teachme](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/teachme).

Once you've got the fundamentals set, you can start learning about investment styles and ones that suit you. I highly recommend to look into indexing.

Some commonly and highly recommended books are:

* Simple Path to Wealth by J Collins - Great starting point on most of the fundamentals I talked about.
* The Richest Man in Babylon by Samuel Clason - Very interesting take on personal finance.
* If You Can: How Millennials Can Get Rich Slowly by William J Bernstein - Very short read and introduction to the concept of indexing and investing in general. It's only 15 pages long and it's free! However, it should be taken more as a guide to learning more. In the book, the author also recommends other books to read further on various topics.
* The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John C Bogle - This is all about indexing I spoke about. Mr Bogle is very very highly regarded in some subsections of the investing community (they've even named themselves after him, Bogleheads, and there's a subreddit that follows his investing principles!).

This should more or less get you started on good grounds. There's a lot to learn but you getting started at 16 is way ahead of the curve. I wish I had this foresight and discipline at your age. Keep it up and keep going, good luck!",2021-06-01 10:56:30
ADA_CodeProfessor,"Hello Ergo Team,

I am a software engineer for a large finance company. I have mostly focused on full stack .NET development (C#,javascript,SQL), but have recently moved over the Haskell. Do you have any advice so I can quickly ramp up to speed and be able to help on your current sprints. I see so much potential in Cardano and Ergo and feel truly honored being at ground zero of this movement. 

It is interesting that Solidity is object oriented, so maybe the learning curve will be low for me. I  want to understand what programming langue we should study. If I walked in the next day to work for Ergo, what language will I need to write in and what are some projects that I would be assigned to as a Jr Haskell/Solidity developer?

Thank you for answering. I am working on a coding school and want to prepare students for jobs in the crypto IT space.

machinegunkisses,"Thanks for your thoughts. It sounds like you see two groups, call them ""growth"" investors (really, pump and dump shops and other speculators) and ""value"" investors (people buying for long term; coin's value determined by its capability). If so, I agree with that assessment.

Personally, I think we're in a crypto bubble, which is why the former group dominates right now. I also think trying to make money like this is a fool's errand: The value of the coins is just what someone else is willing to pay for them, so you have to be ahead of the curve almost all the time to get in and out early. Me, I don't have time for that amount of work, but, I'm sure there're traders who are regularly successful.

I'm interested in the long run value proposition of cryptos, which I think will be determined by their capabilities. It's why I think Bitcoin will fall by the wayside (or just stagnate), because it doesn't really offer anything of value. 

We'll see about smart contracts, but I'm not totally convinced that there's value in decentralizing finance. There could also be a killer app that just hasn't happened, yet.",2021-06-01 14:34:37

iKickdaBass,"&gt; What about the fact that QE is not decreasing any time soon. Just like you said that banks have too much cash and the net effect of that is nil. Additional monetization of bonds is potentially harmful.

If the net affect of it is nil, how is it potentially harmful?

&gt;Also, what about the infrastructure bill and the upcoming govt budget? Increased govt spending could also play a role in driving up inflation.

Government spending increase both demand for goods and shifts the supply curve to meet those demands. The new equilibrium price should be close to the previous one. Issuing bonds to finance infrastructure projects puts excess cash to use. Unlike in normal economic conditions where there may not be excess cash, there is a demand for bonds now because cash is paying so little interest. And with interest rates so low now, it makes a lot of sense to invest in infrastructure projects because a portion of that government spending comes back in the form of more tax revenue to pay the interest on the infrastructure projects.

&gt;Foreign investors have been seeking US Treasury bonds which is also devaluing the dollar. 

Foreign investors seeking US treasuries would not devalue the dollar. Foreign investors need to buy dollars first and then buy the US treasuries with those dollars. The dollar has been declining and interest rates increasing due to selling bonds and using those dollars to  buy other foreign currencies.  

&gt;US being a net importer is thus paying more for the same goods. How will that correct?

The US has been a net importer for a very long time. In times of a strong dollar, those goods are cheaper. In times of a weak dollar, those goods become more expensive. This makes domestically made projects more competitive, both in the US and abroad. Exports increase with a weak dollar and thus ultimately strengthen the dollar and the system self corrects.",2021-06-02 07:02:36

NotTooDeep,"Even better, your situation is!

You have a great exit strategy from this situation; it's get another job at a company with a global presence but better management. 50 direct reports is a stinker, and you really can't do much more than correct admin errors with that volume. And half of them in India? If that's a typical outsourcing arrangement, then you can't do much career development with them. So you're only really managing the careers of 25 people.

But you will be perceived by other companies as somewhat of a superwoman with this on your resume. ""If she can do that, imagine what she can do on our project with 25 resources.""  They'll give you an administrative assistant and more money. I saw this happen in the finance industry. A manager was hired away from a big telecom into a big brokerage and spent her days wearing Italian sport coats to planning meetings. The project managers and technical managers reported to her, but that was it. Different industries view project teams in different ways. Different industries view their org charts somewhere between a necessary evil and a prideful powerpoint slide that shows what a great C-level person they are. 

You're in that part of the career growth curve that is like calculus classes for pre-med students. Doctors don't do much math in real practice, but the math classes serve as filters to ensure only the best pre-med students make it into med school. 

Tradeoffs: do you want to be a Director or VP that hires and fires people like you, and pushes them like you're being pushed?  Do you want to work with a smaller team in fewer time zones? Do you want to live in your current city? Do you want to work at a startup, with all the fun and uncertainty that entails? Do you want to stay in the same industry?

Management skills are easily transferred to different industries in some circumstances, especially in IT. You really do need to have a handle on what your direct reports actually do, but don't need to be able to do their jobs yourself in IT.

Embrace the kid interruptions; they're a blessing in disguise. 

Remote work is much more common because of the pandemic. You are in a time when finding your next gig can be as simple as asking google, ""remote jobs &lt;your job title and a detail or two&gt;"". I started a new job yesterday and that's how I found it.

Observations: stock options at startups are not real. Not until they have an IPO or are acquired. The vast majority of startups never have either of these events.

infant_ape,"Have to debunk one element of this: the geometric mean theory.  

There was a post here a few months back where someone applied the ""geometric mean"" to the phenomenon of people selling on the way up and down (with very few selling at the actual peak) and they came up with some pretty crazy numbers, such as:

*1k per share price total payout would be $33,525,000,000 @ 447 per share (Geometric Mean)*  
*5k per share price total payout would be $75,000,000,000 @ 1000 per share (Geometric Mean)*  
*10k per share price total payout would be $106,050,000,000 @ 1414 per share (Geometric Mean)*  
*42k per share price total payout would be $217,350,000,000 @ 2898 per share (Geometric Mean)*  
*69k per share price total payout would be $278,550,000,000 @ 3714 per share (Geometric Mean)*  
*100k per share price total payout would be $335,400,000,000 @ 4472 per share (Geometric Mean)*  
*500k per share price total payout would be $750,000,000,000 @ 10000 per share (Geometric Mean)*  
*1m per share price total payout would be $1,060,650,000,000 @ 14142 per share (Geometric Mean)*  
*2m per share price total payout would be $1,500,000,000,000 @ 20000 per share (Geometric Mean)*  
*20m per share price total payout would be $4,743,375,000,000 @ 63245 per share (Geometric Mean)*

SO... at $1,000,000/share... this guy thinks the average price to buy-to-cover (number of shares was hypothetical based on suspected SI) for hedgies will only be $14k and change.  

Now while I'm not a finance formula guy, i DO understand the concept of a bell curve as it applies to an average, and such a low number didn't make sense to me.  But hey, again- I'm not a finance guy, so maybe I'm missing something.

BUT... another ape way wrinklier than me jumped in and said ""uh, that's not how geometric means work; they aren't meant to find averages across a bell curve.""  And he went on to explain how geometric means ARE meant to be used to calculate RETURNS, not an average share price.  Here is a pretty clear explanation:

**Understanding the Geometric Mean**  
**In Growth Rates**  
The geometric mean is used in finance to calculate average growth rates and is referred to as the compounded annual growth rate. Consider a stock that grows by 10% in year one, declines by 20% in year two, and then grows by 30% in year three. The geometric mean of the growth rate is calculated as follows:  
((1+0.1)\*(1-0.2)\*(1+0.3))\^(1/3) = 0.046 or 4.6% annually.

SO... as you can see... there is NO application to finding what increasing and decreasing price averages would be across a sell-off on the way up and down during a squeeze.  WOuld there be SOME sort of average price?  Id imagine yes, what with inevitable paper hands and institutional selling-off.  But I imagine that, with apes holding... the average price hedgies pay will be be a far higher average than the geo-mean ape stated above. 

That's all I got.  Peace.  And Hodl.

TL;DR- the geometric mean will not be of any help to apes during a squeeze, so stop spreading it as a concept that will work in our favor.  Other things will, but not this.",2021-06-02 23:37:36
harschso,"Got into a role straight out of uni heavily involving modelling (infra, energy, project finance type of models). The first few months were a steep learning curve, writing macros to optimise models, modelling debt sculpting etc

First I enjoyed it because it was challenging and you get to design mechanisms to translate the client’s requests in the most concise and comprehensive manner as possible. Your logic needs to be easily understood by others, flexible and accurate.

Day to day: Like for any job, there are more thrilling parts to others depending on what’s needed. But as you progress you get more and more into the conceptual part, writing emails explaining your numbers or tackling issues of how things should be modelled.

At some point modelling becomes like writing, the most important is the message you convey/ results you obtain. So I’d say happiness would be more in finding satisfaction in the sector/industry that you are working in. 

When the numbers are not right, you go to the source and re trace the calculations to identify the error.

shadeneeder4202,"&gt;OP is confusing that with government bond rates. It’s a classic case of people getting the bond market rate mixed up with Central Bank overnight rates after reading a Buzzfeed article on monetary policy. Those rates are supposed to be related, but Central Banks can play this game for a very long time. I encourage OP to read up on yield curve control and other methods Central Banks can use to also control bond rates too.

Yes I do know, I have a Masters in this subject and am employed practicing it. Generally fixed-rate mortgage rates are determined based on GoC bond yields (5-year bond determines 5-year mortgage). Variable rate mortgages depend on the BoC's overnight rate. 

There is a linkage in that bond yields depend on the expected trajectory of the BoC's overnight rate. This is more true the shorter the bond's term. For instance, a 2-year bond depends heavily on the expected movement of the BoC's overnight rate. So for instance, if the BoC states they're going to keep the overnight rate at 0.5% for two years and the market believes them the 2-year bond yield will be 0.5%. But at the other end of the spectrum for a 30-year bond the yield is determined by expected economic growth, inflation and the credit worthiness of the country. Who does the determination? Fixed income investors in the City and Wall Street. 

What's terrifying is I'm almost certain neither our Prime Minister nor Finance Minister understand how this all ties together. How can you tell? Their comments around Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) and bond yields being low in the middle of COVID.

MMT's main tenant is that a government which borrows in its own currency cannot default. As a result, government borrowing is only limited by inflation and when you're in a zero rate environment with a demand shortage government borrowing is a ""free lunch"". This is all true but it's incomplete. The ""limited by inflation"" tenant is incredibly important but tends to be down-played. Currently the GoC funds its day-to-day operations through bond sales which on a look-through basis go to both the BoC and bond investors. The BoC buying bonds is what is known as ""monetizing"" the debt, which gets its name from the BoC printing money to purchase bonds. That is totally fine when economy wide supply outstrips demand. Your purchases will stimulate demand, and because there's a demand gap there will be no inflation. 

But if and when the economy is running at full capacity you will start to see inflation from this monetization. At this point the monetization needs to stop to prevent an inflationary spiral. The GoC is then forced to sell many more bonds to actual investors. This will increase bond yields driving up the rates on fixed-rate mortgages.  The BoC will likely be forced to increase its overnight rate as well to keep inflation under control. Now here comes the fallacy that I keep seeing on this sub about how the BoC would never do that, it would send the government and over-levered homeowners into a world of hurt. *They have no choice*. Inflation is a spiral, if you don't raise rates it will drive down the currency, raising the cost of imports, increasing inflation. Anyone who thinks the BoC will keep rates low during a period of rising inflation and bond yields is playing a very dangerous game.",2021-06-03 21:27:33

Darekh87,"It all depends on your situation. If you'd like to live outside your family home and earn a living wage- avoid internships and schemes as they won't pay enough to support yourself under the guise of training, etc. 

If you do live with your family and are happy to continue so, those schemes will provide you with a SOLID training and introduction into the job. 

I can only speak for myself and my life experience. I've worked in finance for the past 10ish years, it is a field of choice for me and as a job it's good enough. I've never done any education in the direction of finance, actually I'm only starting AAT levels 3 and 4 this year (purely just to get a higher paying job). I am what they call a victim of experience. Done every branch of finance, learned on the job and have to say I wouldn't have it any other way- but it's me. I work alongside people who are on apprenticeship schemes, etc. and even tho my workplace offered to pay for whatever I want as long as I will enroll in such a scheme (without it affecting my salary) they all sound like a straight up nightmare to me. Regular calls with a ""talent coach"", catch ups, theory, blah blah blah. I'm used to learning on the job and even tho it's always been a steep learning curve with high stress moments it's the style I prefer. But at my age maybe it's just the fact that I refuse to follow a heavily academic route. If you think that's the way for you tho I'd apply for entry level jobs or admin jobs- those get your foot through the door and later on offer lateral moves into ""proper"" finance within the company. I myself moved to finance from a night shift in a hotel. It involved a lot of audit work and when a finance position opened up my work was appreciated by the FC and I was given a chance. A ""hands- on"" approach also allowed me some better start in the salary area, which was important to me as I am an EU citizen living here by myself so I needed the dough to support myself and save. 

Now, the other side of the coin. If you're OK living at home on an apprentice salary- that's the way to go if your ambition is a Finance Manager/ Financial Controller position still your 20s. Those programs/ schemes provide the certification which will push you forward on the ladder. I have to admit I'm a person who never wanted to be THE BOSS. Mid level managent around 30something k a year is my lifestyle. Come to work, do the job, leave - don't believe in overtime, don't belive in ""we're a family here""- no we're not- it's a job, pay me and leave me alone. So my approach to my career provided me with exactly that- slow but steady salary raises and vastly stress- free jobs. Is there a glass ceiling? Yes, because I do not have the fabled ""ambition"" to progress- don't feel the need to. BUT if you do, and there's nothing wrong with that- if you want it fast- I think sacrificing some years to stay at home and use the schemes to provide you with the necessary papers is worth it. 1 of my current managers is 7 years my junior - and bless her, she's a great boss. I can see she's happy in her position and proud of the hard work she put in in her early 20s. 

So, the question is- what do you think you want from life at this moment? It's not a fair question, because the answer will change many-a times, but all you can do is follow your gut while you find yourself in the current circumstances. 

Get a full time entry level job or follow a more academic/ apprenticeship route..... up to you.

obrian_99,"Story of a dead end team: a team I know have been running more than 5 years now, doing purely quant stuff, mostly machine learning, back test curve fitting. All the guys have backgrounds in stats, math, physics, no finance. 

Performance wise, they've been shitty. Even in the winning years, they've never outperformed the SPX, or even M2 delta. But they're determined to ""never give up""... 

They took me on as an advisor for a while, and the main mistake I noticed was that while the trades were quantitative in nature, their risk management was not. It was all discretionary when it came to position sizing, which trades to put on, or stop; and none of them ever dug deep into why a trade made or lost money. 

So my main advice to you: regardless of how you put trades on. Have an objective, quantitative plan for risk management, i.e. position reduction. When things get stressful, it's very difficult to make optimal decisions quickly on your feet.",2021-06-05 05:53:41
NewCow,"i'm aware of how delta hedging works. what you're describing sounds a little like max pain theory, which fails once you understand MM mechanics better. there are a few things you're misunderstanding.

volume alone doesn't tell you much because you don't know what types of orders those are (buy to open, buy to close, sell to open, sell to close). what matters is open interest at the end of the day, which you don't know either since it is calculated at the end of each day.

delta hedging is a dynamic process, so the MM is continuously adjusting their overall stock + options positions to get as close to aggregate 0 delta as possible. in other words, the MM has been hedging this entire time and does not need to go out at the last minute to buy more shares to fulfill their short call obligations, because they've already been accumulating the necessary inventory (since delta approaches 1 for an ITM option as it approaches expiration). the purpose of delta hedging is to eliminate directional risk, so the MM has no preference of where the stock goes since he/she is hedged already, the MM makes money on volume and the bid/ask spread.

gamma refers to delta's rate of change, and gamma rises as a stock approaches the strike and declines as the option moves deeper into the money (google ""options gamma curve""). consider an OTM call with 0.4 delta. as the stock goes up and approaches the strike, gamma kicks in and delta begins to accelerate, forcing the MM to buy more and more shares to hedge, then once the call is ITM and has a delta of around 0.6, gamma declines and delta starts to decelerate. gamma squeezes have contributed to volatility in these meme stocks since WSB traders buy a lot of OTM weeklies, but a gamma squeeze has no bearing at expiration because again, the MM is already fully hedged at expiration and is not going out to buy stock at the last minute.

hope that helps.

ethereum88,"TL;DR

Curve Finance is a decentralized exchange (DEX) running on Ethereum. It's specifically designed for swapping between stablecoins. All you need is an Ethereum wallet, some funds, and you can swap different stablecoins with low fees and slippage.

Other than swapping, one can also deposit stablecoins for interest. (Currently the interest rate on Curve Polygon is like \~5% + 17% in MATIC which is unparalleled.)

The only downside is its interface, which is quite beginner-unfriendly and looks like MS-DOS.",2021-06-05 15:33:07
r-2-eth-2,"**What Is Curve Finance in DeFi?**

&gt; Curve Finance is an automated market maker protocol designed for swapping between stablecoins with low fees and slippage. Curve is one of the best ways to swap between different tokenized versions of Bitcoin, such as WBTC, renBTC, and sBTC.At the time of writing, there are 17 Curve pools available to swap between many different stablecoins and assets. Similarly to SushiSwap and Uniswap, Curve Finance also has a high profile hard fork - Swerve Finance.

&gt; Curve DAO token stands among the few DeFi tokens that have seen a strong recovery over the past two weeks due to reduced Ethereum gas fees, the launch of Convex Finance and the DeFi sector beginning to find a bottom. Curve Finance and the wider DeFi ecosystem could also be benefitting from the sharp decline in gas fees on the Ethereum network, which had previously priced out many retail traders from performing the simple approval and confirmation transactions required to stake and claim earnings from DeFi protocols. Lower fees have allowed a wider range of users to re-engage with their favorite DeFi protocols, and Curve has been a significant beneficiary of this development.

Mediocre-Diamond9902,"Econ Major here, and I've taken all of these classes except for ECMT 475.

Econ 311 is very good for an introduction to the money and banking system. It focuses more on the theory and explaining how money is used in the financial system, focusing on how it is exchanged, it is much more theory and explanation based. Econ 445 on the other hand, goes into the mathematical calculations for portfolio management through investments in stocks, bonds, options, and futures, as well as calculating and managing risk. Econ 445 is very stats heavy, and for many (including myself) that made it quite difficult. 

I took Econ 311 in the fall and then Econ 445 the next semester, and I would recommend doing that if you are able, I think 311 provides a good background before you get into the nitty gritty stuff in 445. I will say that for both classes, the professors are pretty great. I personally liked Edwardson better, who teaches 311, I love the way he lectures, its so laid back and allowed me to learn the content better. Jansen is a good guy, and he does interesting work at the Econ Research Center, but sometimes his lectures on the content can be shallow, leaving you unable to complete the homework, so just know you might be spending time learning on your own. Again, if you have a stronger background in Stats or finance in general, you should be fine. Neither of them try to trick you or have extremely difficult exams, and Jansen offered a curve when the class didn't do so hot on the final, so they aren't looking to destroy your grade.

&amp;#x200B;

As for ECMT classes, I haven't taken Stat 211 as another poster said, but 461 is basically learning how to use Excel and how to manipulate economic data. The capstone is a research paper. If you take it with Schulman (which is likely, and he is awesome), he provides you with a couple different options of data sets based on what you are interested in (for example, when I took it, there was alcohol sales at the beginning of the pandemic in each texas county, NCAA baseball stats, finance data, and high school sat scores) and there would be data on a bunch of variables in each set, and then you would pick a couple variables you want, and then you would form some hypothesis and run your data set through the tests he teaches in class (regression, ANOVA, t-tests, f-tests, etc) and then write your paper about your conclusions.

ECMT 463 goes more in depth about econometrics, so its a little more theory based, and focuses more directly on regressions and hypothesis testing. There is also a research paper component, except my prof for this one made us find all of our own data and create out own question to test, in all honestly that paper was shorter/easier than the 461 paper.",2021-06-05 21:13:22

MiguelChina,"Farming is a little complicated if you haven't done if before and not always advised until you have taken the time to learn about it. But, a quick run down from my understanding:

When you enter a farm, you are providing liquidity to the pool. So you might add liquidity into a FEG pool for example: You add $1,000 worth of FEG and $1,000 worth of another coin (most likely a stable coin or eth). There a many pairs depending on the farms available. Because your liquidity is in the farm's pool, you will be rewarded with a % of the total rewards from that farm's pool. So, if you have add 1% of the total pool, than you get 1% of the total rewards. 

The rewards come from fees from trading on that pair, so a farm (Sushi, Curve, Polycat, etc.) might reward the pool with .25% on every transaction on that pair (of what you would get 1% because of the liquidity you have added to the pool). 

Also, people might take a loan from the farm and depending on how it is setup (mostly in stable coins), that person will have to pay back the loan with interest, so the farm gets interest payments (like a bank). 

The really high ARP makes this seem really good, but it has downsides depending on the farm, there is almost always entry and exit fees, which you have to pay with the liquidity you are providing, transferring liquidity also requires gas (which can get expensive) and some require time locks (which means you can't access your liquidity for a time period). Farms can also rug pull (@RugSteemer on twitter) is a good source to check before entering a farm/pool. 

If you are new to farming, I would suggest doing some research or starting with a very small amount of money until you get a better idea of how it all works. This is just my understanding, I'm also new to farming, and so you should DYOR before starting with farming.

Also, if this explanation is wrong please call me out, so I can also understand it better.

vuduchyld,"I agree with those below who say zoom out just a little bit.  

Don't consider me a credible source on this, but I think I read somewhere that some of the team recently had some lockups expire, which may have put quite a few MATIC in play on exchanges and generated some available supply.  May not be true.  I can't find that or cite it.  But it may be true...click on the 1-month view here: [https://www.viewbase.com/coin/matic-network](https://www.viewbase.com/coin/matic-network)

But that is short term.  As for the L2/DeFi issue, I think Polygon will do well with retail DeFi.  Institutions are definitely going to be more interested by the security of Arbitrum/Optimism, but if BSC proved one thing, it's that there is a ton of retail demand for inexpensive and fast DeFi.  I tend to believe that even with L2s, 2.0, and everything we know is coming, scaling will be an issue for quite some time.  

I actually like some of the DeFi options on Polygon.  One can choose established players, such as Aave and Curve.  Unlike Alpha or 1Inch, they never went to BSC.  This gives Polygon at least a little bit of legitimacy.  Those teams are really fucking good and smart.  There are also some novel options available.  Mai Finance is at least prima facie similar to MakerDAO.  You can collateralize MATIC, borrow a MiMATIC stablecoin, and use that to farm or buy more crypto.  

I'm not fixing to sell off ETH for MATIC.  (Maybe Bitcoin, though!)  ETH wears the crown.  I deployed a bit of new capital to BSC back in February, though, and I am glad I did.  I've since deployed a bit more new capital and re-deployed BSC capital to MATIC.  If nothing else, it's a worthwhile testnet.  I'm a bit of an experiential learner, and I like being able to move in (AND OUT) of positions with some capital efficiency.",2021-06-07 01:04:46
vuduchyld,"I can't in all good conscience recommend these, because I don't know enough about them, really.  I'm just kind of screwing around with a little bit of capital, because that's how I learn.  DYOR DYOR please please DYOR!

* Both Aave and Curve are on Polygon.  I haven't looked at all the offerings in a while, but as I recall, there was a Polygon option that looked like 3Crv with 5-6% returns on your stables plus 15-20% returns in WMATIC.
* Mai Finance is similar, I think, to MakerDAO.  You can deposit MATIC into a vault, then borrow a MiMATIC stablecoin.  They have a few farming options that allow you to earn the QiDAO token, Qi.  That Qi token has recently had a run up in price from around 50 cents to around 80 cents, so that farming reward ends up being pretty substantial.  You can pool MiMATIC/USDC for farming pure stables to Qi or MiMATIC/Qi.
* My favorite aggregator is Adamant Finance.  I'm looking at their website right now, and it seems too good to be true...SO IT PROBABLY IS.  The rewards on stables are outrageously high.  I've got a couple of different stable combos running, including FRAX/USDC on Sushi and DAI/USDC on QuickSwap.
* Maybe somebody like u/LogrisTheBard can tell me what I'm missing, here, but Adamant TVL has jumped from under $100mm to about $130mm in maybe 48 hours.  Keep in mind...some of the rewards come from their ADDY token (not all...and it depends on the pool).  But the market cap of the token is less than $20mm.  They show monthly profits to stakers of the token at more than $4mm.  EDIT: and like the Qi token, the ADDY token has run pretty wild the last 48 hours...up from $34 to $57.
* So market cap to TVL is an absurdly low 0.15...and even assuming no growth in TVL or profits, they would be generating $50mm per year in profits that get paid to $19mm worth of hodlers....so 2.5x cash flow to cap?  How could that even be true in this universe?  Of course, the ADDY token, like the Qi token, has jumped from $34 to $57 just over the course of this weekend, so maybe it's true and people are catching on to it?

DYOR, DYOR, DYOR.  I don't think Curve is going to be rugging you.  Adamant has an audit, at least, but that shit ain't worth much judging by all the BSC rugs lately.  I will tell you point blank that if I get rugged, I will shrug my shoulders and sigh, but I am NOT risking any capital here that I can't afford to walk away from.

ProjectEqual,"I don't know why you're getting some hate around here for trying out something new... as long as it's Eth you're willing to lose you should be fine. The whole point of DeFi right now is being early and experimenting... being an early user comes with high risks but also potentially high rewards.

That being said, as someone said below the vault should:

1. Convert 1/2 of your Eth to yvBoost (which is CRV locked permanently in Curve protocol)
2. Stake yvBOOST in the yvBOOST-ETH SLP on SushiSwap for SUSHI rewards
3. Deposits this SLP into the yvBOOST-ETH pJar on Pickle Finance for PICKLE rewards.

Key-Night-3736,"OP here. This is my curiousity. These corporations don't care about actual public sentiment, per se, as much as backlash beyond the point that they can PR it away. In today's infantilish hyper sensitivity to anyone being even 'offended' by literally anything, they are just getting ahead of the curve PR wise, while in fact seeing the numbers on their ledgers reflect the facts that THEIR customer base IS more diverse ethnically than ever, and will continue to be. And they are ALOT more sensitive, but seemingly about the more superficial aspects, while the flagrant abuses of corporate power go unchecked in plain view, while they make a commercial with woke content, or whatever. And that's enough for their critics! Not mocking your assertion, it IS remarkable their stance, which itself is the bigger shame.

Unlike Republican adherents, banks deal in the real world they exist in, not some idealized fantasy throwback to a Norman Rockwell world that never fucking even existed. They don't choose the demographics, they simply do business with the customers that ARE. As for their fading prejudices, they are just getting out of their own way, and with the times, way late, but sooner than most, for PR value. It's just smart business, and they reap kudos as well, from the growing demographics.

As for the opposite side of the coin \[consumers power of boycott of brands not sufficiently woke\] well, good luck, you know? The brand will outlast any protest. It just WILL. Reebok anyone? Hugo fucking Boss anyone? Coco Chanel? People forget, most don't care in the first place, some even go for contrary consumption to own the libs, or the cons for that matter.

Just be careful that DeFi comes with a plethora of added risks.

Hacks, scam, bugs, exploits, exit strategies happen all the time even with the most respected platforms. Also transactions are irreversible and there's no customer support. And as much as I like them, there's always the counterpart risk as basically any respectable defi has a company/org that backs it and has ownership of the smart contract. Best case scenario, the smart contract is your third party.

And for as much we all hate banks, keep in mind that DeFi (and many CeFi yeld platforms) don't provide the same level of asset security that banks provide. And even the best stablecoin is not backed by any government, while in the majority of the world's countries the respective government offer some kind of protections for fiat deposited in Bank accounts by their citizens.


That said, if you move considerable amount of tendies (so gas fees are no big issue), go DeFi on Ethereum. Aave, curve, compound, yearn finance to name a few (in order of trust -imho-).

And GALE is a token that only goes up and can be exchanged for BUSD (yes, it is not a gimick). It uses a linear bonding curve model:[https://docs.blizzard.money/snowbank/gale](https://docs.blizzard.money/snowbank/gale)

So it is basically backed by BUSD, and there is a 3% fee on withdrawals so the price goes up, and obviously if you get in early you will earn more GALE then someone who gets in later, since the price will keep going up.

Alternatively, on Pantherswap there is currently a Panther -&gt; BUSD jungle, and you can stake CAKE there to get Panther.",2021-06-09 17:52:42

r-2-eth-2,"**Curve Finance's new release positions project for AMM takeover**

&gt; Earlier today Curve Finance announced the launch of a new ""Algorithm for exchanging volatile assets."" Curve's base functionality is designed to enable low-slippage swaps between similar assets, such as one type of stablecoin to another - USDC to DAI, etc - by concentrating liquidity on a bonding curve weighted towards a particular price. While the math and architecture may be difficult to understand, the end result is not: Curve is now taking on the broader AMM space with what it believes to be a more efficient product for both traders and liquidity providers, using automatically rebalancing fee and price structures. The DeFi community has reacted glowingly, with many christening the release as ""Curve v2."" Observers have been gushing about the capital efficiency and liquidity optimizations the new model offers.

TeamHume,"Is it just me or are there others still boggling at us breaking through $4000/share like it was nothing earlier this year? And still managing to seemingly settle in for months at the 3000+ range...

People were going crazy when it passed $420 18 months ago. When it started going above, people were shouting about the need to sell because the stock was clearly getting years ahead of itself. A friend of mine sold half his shares as it approached $500 in order to recoup his entire investment and “let the other half be a free roll”.

I know a lot of rapid growth is being priced in and I believe it will go much higher by 2025 ... but seriously, wtf are we doing hovering at $3000+ as early as 2021?

Revanchist1,"For most well made projects and dApps, the documentation is usually the best place to learn about all the key parts. 

https://alchemix-finance.gitbook.io/alchemix-finance/

Most documentations are explained simply but may take multiple reads to fully comprehend how the systems work.

The Transmuter plays a major role in trying to maintaing the peg. The yield from the deposited Dai (earned via Yearn Finance Dai vault) is sent to the Transmuter contract. When you deposit alUSD into the Transmuter, you will be able to withdraw Dai at the 1:1 peg. The alUSD is burnt and Dai is distributed.

Things get more complicated though. 
u/LogrisTheBard 's posts explains it great.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nr5cic/daily_general_discussion_june_3_2021/h0htw0t?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3

But due to some whales wanting to farm efficiently without incurring Slippage, there is a significant amount of Dai (permanently-ish) locked in the Transmuter which is earning yield for all users of Alchemix. Effectively boosting the interest earned on everyone deposits.

Another aspect is the arbritage opportunity. If alUSD loses its peg (alUSD worth less than Dai), you can swap alUSD via curve and deposit the cheap alUSD in the Transmuter to recieve the 1 alUSD:1 Dai. However by using the Transmuter, you are reducing the total amount of Dai in the system that is being used to yield farm. Which means you are reducing the effective yield of Alchemix Dai Vault for everyone. 


The ideas is simple but complicated systems have emerged from them.


MakerDao, Yearn finance, Alchemix, Curve Finance, Uniswap (AMM) These are the main systems that people new to the space should read up on. And you can get the best info from their documentations.",2021-06-10 05:22:19

greenbean94,"There's one corporate firm that might fit into this category (putting particular value on top-tier finance or consulting experience) and it is literally the #1 ranked corporate firm, Wachtell.  Wachtell only actively recruits top (measured by 1L grades) students from seven law schools. It is very difficult to get a job there, and it's a bad idea to go to law school with the idea that you need to become a Wachtell associate.

With a few exceptions, hiring at the top corporate law firms is determined by two things: (1) whether the firms recruit at your law school (they all recruit at T14 schools, plus a few others, and some try to take most of their summer associate class from the top schools in the T14) and (2) your 1L grades. Previous work experience is not especially relevant, though it might be a conversation starter in an interview or something that helps on the margin. If it informs why you want to go into a particular area of corporate law (e.g. ""I was an investment banker prior to law school, and am now really interested in being a capital markets associate.""), it might  help in the interview, but it won't make up for your grades. I just graduated and know many people working at top 5-10 law firms in NYC - some went straight through to law school, some worked, but their pre-law school jobs didn't in any way affect their outcomes.

If you want to work at a top corporate law firm, the best way to do it is to go to a T14 law school and do well (at least in the top 1/3 of your class) on the curve your 1L year. Your grades are the most important factor in determining where you'll get a job. Many top firms have grade cutoffs (varying by school) below which they won't consider applicants at all. For now, you should focus on getting a good LSAT score.",2021-06-10 22:33:24

ResortBeautiful,"Hi! I am y4 business student (this coming aug), I am not sure if this is going to be super helpful, but pehaps maybe sharing my experiences may help? I know what youre feeling, that B+ no matter how hard you work dissapointment really hits hard. 

For me, what I realised that sometimes it comes down to luck and chance, sadly. Like for some of my mods, I did better for all the components and still ended up with a B+ while other mods where i felt i did the bare minimum i ended up with an A- or an A. Usually I attribute this is like the ridiculous papers that are supposed to separate the strong student from the weak student but just end up randomly rewarding some students. For example, when I took FIN3701, Corporate Finance, the finals was a 20+ question MCQ, in the exam, there were some questions that tested really werid obsequre memory facts like one single line burried in a whole mountain of slide decks, you could argue only smart students will memorise this one line from the entrie syllabus, but in truth, i only got it correct because it just so happen i was staring at that particular slide right before the test and did some jimmy neutron brain power memory to remember it. Additionally, in my year, the questions were randomised with no backwards navigation, which resulted in some people getting the really tough questions first and ended up having no time for the easy questions. For this exam particularly, it was clear to me that the forced bell curve really is kinda random at times and does not really favour those that put in effort. Another exam of this would be one of my BA modules, IT3010, Data Management With SQL, it was an MCQ exam only, and again I managed to guess some answers correctly and did better than my friends that are very clearly smarter than me. Personally, imo the bell curve really screws people over and throws them into the B+ grade even if you tried really really hard. 

The only 2 ways I have managed to get an A and A+ in any mod is firstly, like i mentioned dumb luck, and secondly you have to be an absolute god. When I did FIN3702 Investments (sth i cant remember the mod name) I absolutely devoted my entire life to it. I spent hours on it, staying up till 5am+ getting homework absolutely perfect, I would answer questions 2-3 times in class, get full marks for all the assignments and get 80% percentile for all exams. It was very very ridiculous. Not only that, I am naturally more inclined to stats and math so this mod really was right in my wheelhouse. Only then was i able to get an A :""). It was a pretty harrowing experience, while i am proud of it, I realised that it takes a lot to get an A in business school :/.

This experience might be limited to my own point of view, and i may be dumber than your average FCH biz kid so this might be a wharpped opinion, but it is an opinion nonetheless haha. Some people plan from the start of the sem which mod they want to dedicate their lives to, i did that with mine. I started before the sem began, studying seniors notes, looking through slides for class part opportunities and finding practice papers etc so perhaps you may try this. But this is not a guarantee, the bell curve gods might simply think you unworthy and cast you aside no matter how hard you try :"").

Sorry for the long post i am very passionate about the B+ A- grade boundary war. 

TLDR: If you wanna do well in biz school, dumb luck, or absolutely sacrifice your life and prepare to hit the ground running before the week 0 even begins.

ChanceTheWrapper68,"If you find these step complicated then I assume you haven't used defi a lot or not at all. If that assumption is correct I would like to warn you of the amount of risk you would be taking by doing what the OP is suggesting. 
Defi is not like Binance, you are on your own if something happens. In this case the largest risk that I would consider is that you have to purchase the Dfyn token because 50% of liquidity provider token has to be the Dfyn token and the other half is whatever you choose to match with it.
The token is very new and there is no guarantee that it will not be worthless in some time, if that happens you also lose whatever you matched with the Dfyn token. That said, I don't know this project and have only looked at their website. This might be a good project that goes far. But from what I saw there is nothing special about it.
Additionally, the OP is incentivised to advertise this since anyone who participates will have to buy the Dfyn token, therefore pushing up the price of the token (which the OP has already invested in). They present this as a good way to get high apy, but apy means nothing if the token is worthless. I find this disingenuous and therefore would trust the OP less (or they just don't realize this themselves or have some reason to believe in this project).

If you're interested in getting better yields than Binance offers, I would advise to either try out projects on the Binance chain first and only ones that have been around for a bit or time (pancakeswap, beefy finance, autofarm, pancakebunny, or some others that I don't know about) or if you want the cheaper fees of polygon then curve, aave, quickswap, and sushiswap are all reputable (but with lower apys) and they do not require you to purchase their tokens to participate.

If you knew all of this then sorry for wasting your time. I just get a bit scared for people because of the amount of scams and bad projects in this space and a new person often hasn't developed the level of scepticism and mistrust that you have to have.",2021-06-11 09:04:33

My understanding is the Sushiswap liquidity pools are subsidised so 191780 Titan are allocated to the Titan/Matic pool per day, with $14 million in the pool at the moment it means this large amount of coins is spread amongst a small number of deposited coins, hence the high interest?

herbys,"&gt; What does a Cybertruck do that a lightly used F-150 XL couldn't?

Driving at six cents per mile of operational cost. An F150 costs three times as much in operational cost per mile.

That such difference in operational cost can offset the additional acquisition cost of an electric truck at a certain mileage level should be fairly easy to understand for someone with a background in finance. Cost difference which for the single motor truck is less than $10K compared to a minimally equipped F150, and that is not even counting tax incentives and resale price of the truck after you are done with it.
And if you are comparing with a used truck, you have to consider the even lower efficiency and higher maintenance cost of a used truck, and resale difference of the used electric truck and the numbers will still make sense after a certain mileage level. What that mileage level is depends on the cost of the used truck, it's fuel economy, how long you plan to keep it and the actual resale price of a Cybertruck, which we don't know yet, but if you are saying that a no mileage that intersection happens I will have to call BS on your stated credentials since it's finance 101 that a curve with a higher fixed cost with a lower incremental cost will eventually intercept one with a lower fixed cost and higher incremental cost.

BNEIte,"Behind the paywall:


Beijing will cast the G7 as a democratic China-bashing weekend, but it has only itself to blame. Australia’s presence shows it is getting support from a growing list of nations.


There is a view liberal democracy is in its twilight years and this weekend’s gathering of the Group of Seven industrialised economies – with Australia, South Korea, and India also invited – could be little more than a heroic last stand by the so-called Democratic 10, or D10.


According to this perspective, Scott Morrison landing in Britain to rally democracies to resist coercion and preserve freedom is a fool’s errand and will needlessly provoke China. Why will he not accept the tide of history has changed and is washing away liberal practices in its wake?


The record shows arguments about inevitability are almost always wrong. That China is powerful is undeniable.


Even so, it is poorly appreciated that China, and the entire region more generally, cannot continue to rise without the resources, know-how and assistance of the democracies about to meet in Cornwall.


We know getting democracies to act together is more difficult than herding cats. But they are far from a spent force and democracies retain considerable strategic and economic agency. The summit will be one of the more consequential gatherings for Australia and the Indo-Pacific region.


A rule of thumb in international affairs is the inverse relationship between the size of the grouping and the determination to tackle important and difficult issues.


Unlike recent G7 summits with a motley collection of observer nations, this year’s version has only four invited guests – the three regional democracies mentioned and democratic South Africa. Narendra Modi is unable to attend in person because of the Covid-19 emergency in India.



But composition is indicative of intent. It is no coincidence that Australia and India were invited. With the US and Japan, they comprise the Indo-Pacific Quad, the four formidable economic and military powers most committed to counter directly the worst aspects of Chinese behaviour.


The Quad countries may be ahead of the curve but there is broader support for them than is widely appreciated.


Britain, the EU and Canada belatedly have come to a similar conclusion that the military, industrial, trade, technological and repressive policies of China is a serious and growing threat to their individual and collective interests.


It is worth noting this year’s G7 summit is framing discussion on many issues ranging from pandemic response to trade and technological policy as defined by a contest between liberal and authoritarian approaches.


Resolve is one thing. What about the notion that the proverbial horse has bolted and it is futile to resist creeping Chinese economic and eventually political and military dominance of the region? The combined military weight and prowess of the democracies are superior, even if the gap is closing quickly. But much will depend on the trajectory and decisions of the trading nations in the Indo-Pacific.


In this context, Chinese hopes of economic dominance may be fulfilled only if maritime East Asia becomes a Sino-centric region. Many believe this has already occurred or else is imminent.


It may surprise some that foreign direct investment from Japan, the US, EU and South Korea – all present at Cornwall this weekend – are more important sources of capital for developing trading nations in Asia than is China. Partnerships with government and firms from these advanced democracies add far more to the productive capacity of these developing maritime nations than do interactions with Chinese entities.


Moreover, these regional economies – China included – are heavily reliant on importing innovation, technology and know-how, the lion’s share coming from entities headquartered in D10 nations. Beijing cannot afford economic separation from democratic nations but seeks their subservience and acquiescence to unequal arrangements in China’s favour.


In large measure, ambitious Chinese blueprints such as the Belt and Road Initiative and Made in China 2025 were formulated to address its own vulnerabilities and shortcomings. Even then, the BRI cannot succeed if China is unable to freely access the deep consumer markets in Western Europe.


This then is the frustration and danger for the Chinese Communist Party. China needs continued access to D10 consumer markets, technologies, innovation, know-how and finance to get itself into a position of enduring strength.


Far from being a self-sustaining economic behemoth, China is making the mistake of spiting the nations on which it needs to continue its rise. The list of complaints is long and growing – systemic economic predation and theft, unreciprocated trade and investment practices, military assertiveness, territorial expansion, economic coercion and interference in the institutions of other nations.


Shouldn’t China have expected pushback? Yes, although Beijing was relying on a divide-and-rule approach, which is possible in the absence of democratic unity or where there is a loss of faith in democratic community itself. Encouraging the latter is what its messaging about superior authoritarian competence is all about – a perspective too many enjoying the fruits of democratic society are all too happy to accept without further investigation.


Hubris and overreach will come back to bite. China has crossed the line too far and too many times. Democracies in North America, Europe and Asia are starting to talk in similar ways and move in similar directions, albeit at different speeds as democratic processes are always messy and inelegant.


Australia has been invited to the past three summits, including the one this weekend, and it is playing more than its part in focusing and steering the conversation, with the economic bruises to show for it.

Kiwi_Global,"think people are excited about defi because it brought new opportunities in this space and there is a glimp of hope that crypto assets aren't just going to be converted to dollars in the end, only for speculation to increase your net value outside crypto. with defi there are ways you can leave your assets on the network while also profiting, against just holding the asset to sell it.

i'm eth bull so keep that in mind, my experience is mostly in eth and ofc would recommend to check defi on ethereum BUT with calculated risks. you asked me are there better deals on exchanges or on ethereum and the thing is, nobody can tell you what is more profitable in the end. its similar as if you asked me what next token will moon. no one knows, and if they claim to know they are probably lying.

in my view if you are entering with smaller amounts exchanges like coinbase or binance are just fine. but keep in mind that on binance chain there were a lot of hacks for smaller cap tokens lately so don't ape into staking the most obscure tokens, stick with those that have already some history behind them.

for ethereum you can check ROI percentages using [https://zapper.fi](https://zapper.fi) \- go to Farm and under Farmin Opportunities search for token you have, and there you can check current ROI on different dapps. Zapper is just a view from which you can interact with all different dapps from one interface. So you got aave, curve, uniswap etc in there, no need to go to different web pages. also keep in mind that ROI or APY are constantly changing and there is always a smart contract risk. But for the most popular dapps the risk isn't that high because they were already battle tested. also the disadvantage are the fees for interacting with the network. on ethereum fees are currently larger than on binance chain for example. for them to fall down you will have to wait unfortunately a few weeks till arbitrum gets live. currently you can transfer your funds on polygon using zapper for smaller fees between contracts. but polygon is a side chain so with it you aren't as bad as on binance chain(centralized) but not also high security(ethereum), you are somewhere in the middle..

&amp;#x200B;

from my experience, if you want to earn something from defi on ethereum right now, firstly read about different defi apps and what they do. after you select one enter slowly but you need to have at least couple of hundred dollars to be profitable in the medium term(3-6months) because you are dealing with network fees which will eat you net value if you are just clicking around on different dapps.

&amp;#x200B;

hopefully you can find something that will suit you. if defi is boring(in the end when was finance really exciting?) you can check other dapps that aren't defi, like pooltogether for lossless lottery, maybe ens or even opensea for ntfs. but keep in mind those aren't financial opportunities, they are more exploring type of apps",2021-06-11 19:12:06
Basement_Armory,"@OP, I get what you're saying, as you've told people at least twice now that you're saying ""What if all you had to use for armor was AR500 targets?"" .....So that we're on the same page, I'll give you the short answer, a possibility of what you're looking for, and the correct response.

Short answer: ""...then I wouldn't run armor."" 

Lots of people don't run armor, and while yes I do have some and I do run it, it is not a necessity. The honest to goodness truth is, most of us will never, EVER be in a gunfight. We train in the hopes that if we HAVE to be, we'll be able to swiftly and accurately employ whatever means we have to end it quick. As such, if we're ever in a position that we should be going in with armor, it means this situation is already royally fucked - unless it is literally your job to do this and if that is the case, you're gonna have good armor already (I hope). Truthfully, armor weighs you down unless you're spending $texas$ for something lightweight enough that it doesn't ruin your day to be in it for more than 5 minutes. So if you don't NEED it, go without it. Think of Heemayer's ""Killdozer"" - AR500 plate is 3/8"" thick, and he stacked 1/2""+ inch thick armor all over it .... but unless you as a person have the horsepower and endurance of a Komatsu d355a (and even then, it was only running at like 10MPH), carrying several loaded mags and any other kit PLUS heavy, heat-inducing plates is not gonna be a good time.

If you really want, I am happy do give a graduate-level dissertation as to WHY using steel made for construction buckets is a terrible idea for armor, but for the sake of an already long response, I'll just say ""don't"". If you are dead set on using it, I would slip a phone book or textbook over the front and have some sort closed cell foam pad on the back to absorb trauma. Part of the point of armor is not only to deflect bullets, but to slow them down and spread/absorb the impact enough that it doesn't feel like you got hit by a 3200fps Mack truck. The thickness and repetitive layers of the phonebook/textbook can help slow it down and capture it in place enough that the spalling could be minimized as well as slowing the bullet even more to prevent penetration, and the foam backing may also work as a cheap way to not feel slapped by the side of a bulldozer.

IF. YOU. HAVE. TO. RUN. BUDGET. PLATES. .... which NOBODY does, but if for whatever reason you absolutely HAVE to keep up with your larper8or hipstergram friends, don't spend nearly $400 on a ""if the gunshots don't kill me, the plates will"" setup when you can get a legitimate setup for the same price. You can pick up a Condor MOPC plate carrier for around $75 new if you look around or a DDT Krieger for near the same. After that, search for ""4401"" or ""4401sh"" plates. Bulletproof-it.com and bodyarmoronline.com both sell a pair of the 4401 single curve composite stand-alone plates that are essentially Hesco 4401's without the logo for around $300. You can even finance with something like Sezzle, or for the super-broke with garbage credit, you can use Quadpay or the PayPal Buy-in-4 options to split that $300 into much easier to chew on bites. There are also RMA 1155 plates, and many other affordable options that are infinitely less likely to sever arteries from their spall than splashy steel. You can do it, I believe in you.",2021-06-11 21:34:35
yprivacymatter,DAI-USDC-USDT curve vault OR the iron finance vaults,2021-06-11 22:01:15
TheGarbageStore,"Stablecoin update: the total supply of stablecoins is $108.953 billion, a 0.38% increase week-over week.    A 0.38% increase is not really what you would expect to see if money was massively flowing in to stablecoin issuers.   We saw some growth in the US-domiciled and non-US-domiciled custodial sectors (Tether).   We have a new high of $22.32b USDC, $9.356b BUSD (despite Silvergate having some issues with Binance), $1.009b PAX, $0.714b HUSD, $1.436b TUSD, and $0.178b GUSD- the latter two being new highs.   In the algorithmic sector, Dai increased 9.6% week-over-week, while many of the others decreased: we have $0.203b sUSD, $1.899b UST, $0.366b USDN, and $0.713b LUSD, along with $2.043b Fei.  The supply of Tether increased 0.94% to $62.6b.  
 
Here on BTCM, we proudly bring you Real Quantitative Alpha with respect to the stablecoin sector.    Often it is asked “How risky is Tether”?    Often, it is answered very poorly in a conspiratorial manner.  Let’s take a look at stablecoin borrowing rates on Compound: Tether was added to this protocol in mid-May and you can borrow it (or other stablecoins)  in exchange for paying an APR, shown below on the y-axis with time on the X-axis.  

https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/cryptocurrency-lending/compound-borrow-rates

If you integrate the area under the curve for these rates, you get a rough estimate of the interest the borrower pays, which allows us to ask the question “if we want to borrow a stablecoin, is Tether more expensive to borrow than USDC”?   Now, the real, hard-hitting question is “what is each stablecoin’s perceived default risk”, and the market is an aggregate of all of our feelings on the matter.   But, Compound supply rates don’t tell you that entirely because there’s variable supply/demand for each product due to things like USDT-denominated perps markets and USDC-denominated smart contracts. 

So, let’s integrate this function, from May 2020 to the present time, with respect to time.    The ratio of the USDT area under the curve (AUC)  to the USDC AUC is 1.3157:  Tether is more expensive to borrow since its inception.    If you only calculate the rates after the date of the NYAG settlement (23 Feb 2021), the USDT-USDC premium drops to 1.137, with the caveat of this being a smaller interval.    The market reacted and Tether became cheaper to borrow.   If a default happens, the borrower is favored, because furnishing a USDT-denominated debt becomes cheaper in USD.     Finally, if you only calculate the rates post-release of Tether’s balance sheet, the premium steepens again to 1.224- which is still lower than when Tether was under investigation by NYAG. This is very recent and I have the least confidence in this number.

How do you interpret this data?  The relative borrowing costs of USDT to USDC have dropped since the settlement, which implies that the market thinks risk is lower.   Now, you can buy BTC with borrowed USDT or borrowed USDC.    The USDT markets are more liquid and developed.  The 13.7% Tether premium is an aggregate of a liquidity premium and a risk premium, which implies that Compound users (who tend to be high-information digital asset veterans, given the protocol is not incredibly user friendly) perceive the additional riskiness of Tether as being quite low.",2021-06-12 01:00:01

Through my experiences, it's all about overcoming the learning curve.

&amp;#x200B;

Reading, listening &amp; watching always helps, but when you are actively establishing a startup, you need to be actively always doing what you have read, listened to &amp; watched - to then after evaluating the bad/good which came after doing it.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, if things are not going the way you planned, modify your plan into something more coherent in nature to achieve the goal you have established.

&amp;#x200B;

In business, it's one thing to know it, and a whole other thing to know why/how/where + when to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

Another challenge for me, in the beginning, was understanding that everything you have learned related to your industry &amp; service are things that your customers vaguely understand. So you are, in a way, trying to get the attention of something super opposite to you personally.

&amp;#x200B;

Why? Because that's why you are there to service them - if they already knew everything about it, they'd tell you to fly a kite &amp; they already have that taken care of.

&amp;#x200B;

**Simple Example:**

Let's say you hate finance - who would you consider paying for help?

&amp;#x200B;

A person the opposite of you that loves finance so much they do it every day.",2021-06-12 02:09:52
Rain_Bear,"From the link:

The Laffer curve as presented is simplistic in that it assumes a single tax rate and a single labor supply. Actual systems of public finance are more complex, and there is serious doubt about the relevance of considering a single marginal tax rate.\[4\] In addition, revenue may well be a multivalued function of tax rate; for instance, an increase in tax rate to a certain percentage may not result in the same revenue as a decrease in tax rate to the same percentage (a kind of hysteresis). Furthermore, the Laffer curve does not take explicitly into account the nature of the tax avoidance taking place. It is possible that if all producers are endowed with two survival factors in the market (ability to produce efficiently and ability to avoid tax), then the revenues raised under tax avoidance can be greater than without avoidance, and thus the Laffer curve maximum is found to be farther right than thought. The reason for this result is that if producers with low productive abilities (high production costs) tend to have strong avoidance abilities as well, a uniform tax on producers actually becomes a tax that discriminates on the ability to pay. However, if avoidance abilities and productive abilities are unrelated, then this result disappears.\[66\]

Additionally, the Laffer curve depends on the assumption that tax revenue is used to provide a public good that is separable in utility and separate from labor supply, which may not be true in practice.\[65\]

Some A/R function are co-mingled with credit functions (like where I use to previously work) and you might assist with credit analysis, updating credit records, etc. 

If the company you are joining is advanced on the automation curve, you might be assisting with A/R master data activities (opening customer accounts in the ERP, closing accounts, changing invoicing terms, etc.)

If your company has A/R co-mingled with accounting, you might be performing A/R reconciliations for large customers who make lump-sum payments to their accounts periodically and invoices have to be manually matched/paired to keep on top of the account. 

A/R and A/P functions get really bad rep on a lot of these subreddit because they are not sexy but, depending on the organization and the structure, this is not a bad place to start you career. 

Folks in finance forget that A/R and A/P is where a business 'core' exists from a back-office perspective (collecting from customers paying your suppliers) so you can get a really deep understanding of the business and its cash activities if you are switched on! 

E.g. who are their top customers? how often do they pay? How good is the business at collecting cash? How easily does the business extend credit? Is the business trying to attract customers with super relaxed credit? 

In my old organization, if  you worked in A/R you had A LOT of interaction with sales including the VP because of allowance for doubtful accounts reporting, collection cycles problems, new customers with unusual credit terms or one-off transactions or 'deals'.

1. Beefy Finance
2. Autofarm

There's plenty of others, but IMO these 3 are the best, oldest and robustest.  Holyshxt my autocorrect thinks robustest is a real word.  Maybe it is.  Beefy and Auto are easier to use and prettier than Yearn.  Yearn is a UI mess IMO.

Beefy and Autofarm don't work on the Ethereum network like Yearn does.  They work on other networks such as BSC and Polygon.  The fees are cheaper on BSC and Poly so it's easier to jump in and out of vaults and you don't have to worry about tx fees cutting into your gains any time the APY drops to 8% and you want to change vaults.

moanonyme,"Je préface en précisant que si je bosse en finance, je ne suis pas du tout économiste, et la macro c'est toujours complexe, donc tout ce que je dis est a prendre avec des pincettes.

Ce que tu décris est vrai : l'effet du 
 lag entre l'inflation réelle et les prix d'abord des produits et services, puis des salaires. Mais en réalité a moins qu'il y est hyper inflation son impact n'est pas si important si tant est que les salaires suivent.

Par contre l'effet sur les prêts est bien réel, et c'est très positif pour les emprunteurs. Ça devient un vrai levier d'accession au capital.

Une théorie de macro qui n'est plus 100% vraie dit aussi que l'inflation c'est la variable d'ajustement utilisée par les banques centrales pour pouvoir accélérer ou ralentir l'économie et arriver à un niveau d'équilibre ou théoriquement on a le chômage minimum. C'est la Philips curve. L'idée c'est de dire que comme il y a peut d'inflation tu peux te permettre d'économiser pour consommer plus tard, la où un peu plus d'inflation forcerait les gens a consommer immédiatement, ce qui augmenterait consommation, et donc production et activité. 

Une autre idée pour répondre un peu a l'envers sur pourquoi j'aimerais voir plus d'inflation : les banques centrales font du quantitative easing de façon assez aggressive depuis 2008 pour relancer l'economie. Mais depuis qu'elles font ça deux choses se sont passé : le PIB se decorelle de plus en plus du salaire moyen ou du chômage, et nous n'avons pas d'inflation si on regarde les mesures tradi comme le CPI.

En réalité il y a de l'inflation... Mais sur les capitaux, deux actifs ont vu leur prix s'envoler depuis 2008 par rapport aux produits et services : c'est l'immobilier et les valeurs boursières. Tout le monde dit que les prix sont complètement decorrelés des fondamentaux. Pourquoi ?  Parceque tout l'argent du quantitative easing est capté par les propriétaires de capital, qui le réinvestissent dans ces actifs. Le retour de l'inflation montrerait pour moi que l'argent circule à nouveau dans les classes de travailleurs et consommateurs.",2021-06-13 17:27:12

Now, with a masters degree you don't need to start at the bottom, you can come in at the middle level. Consider this, would being a warehouse worker or a buyer in a company help your career? Nope, because they are now under your professional proficiency level. What you need to do is leverage your CPA to get a good logistics job, which you will find very easily if you apply for middle management level roles where your CPA is a benefit. 

Just remember, supply chain intro roles can be a fork lift driver or a warehouse stacker, or it can be a procurement manager a supply chain analyst and more. Just decide what branch you want to take and start your career in the middle of an organizational hierarchy. Don't waste time being a pawn when you can be a rook. 

I speak from experience, having started out literally sweeping floors back in the 1970's and working up the ladder to C-level roles. The degree is great for basic knowledge and getting a good level job, but what will make you great is your attitude, your learning curve and your ingenuity.

Oh, and never ever say, ever ""I don’t plan on furthering my education"" this is the dumbest thing to say. We are all continuing to learn (its called continuous education which is a must!), if you don't want to learn then just go bum out on a beach in Goa and clean dishes for a living.",2021-06-14 06:48:27
ObModder,"""The Gotthard Post is one of the best-loved Swiss paintings, embodying as it does the quintessence of the Alpine country. The stagecoach, now the very model of romantic serenity, had at the time only been travelling the pass for a few decades. The new road was celebrated as a masterpiece of engineering. Koller here depicts the acceleration it made possible by having the vehicle overtake a herd of cows as it plunges down the valley. The varieties of movement shown – the plodding cows and the racing coach – amplify the painting’s dramatic effect. The panicked calf serves Koller as an anecdotal focus for his illustration of speed. The coach is heading straight for the viewer along the steep zigzag of the pass, and, under full steam and heavily laden as it is, threatens to overshoot the curve, as apparently exemplified by the direction in which the driver is holding his whip.
And yet Koller is far from painting a realistic portrait of the Gotthard post. One of his initial ideas, showing guests at a rest stop, would have been a more faithful representation of what was a safe and dependable means of transport, moving over 70,000 travellers a year across the 2,100-metre pass. 
Koller’s Gotthard Post was commissioned by Switzerland’s Northeastern Railway as a farewell gift to Alfred Escher, the Swiss tycoon who was leaving to help found and finance the Gotthard railway. Koller deliberately avoided including any direct reference to the modernizing influence of rail, preferring instead to create an allegory of the acceleration of means of transport.
The painter was not particularly fond of the work himself; according to him, the best thing about it was its title. But it was to enjoy great and long-standing popularity, due surely to the associative range of its motif: the Gotthard is a symbol of safe passage across the Alps, of a remarkable feat of Swiss engineering, for all that the accomplishment itself is not the main subject. And finally, the Gotthard is emblematic of the sublimity of the Alps. All of these aspects stand for the qualities and achievements of the young nation of Switzerland, and thus crystallize the concept of ‘home’.""

SnoopHappyCoin,"I agree with a lot of your points except when you say that TITAN has no value. It has value in the sense that you can use it in a liquidity pool to get a high APR and it's also linked to Iron Finance. If you believe in their mission it might hold value to you.  
It is similar to tokens like AAVE, QUICK, CAKE, BAKE, SUSHI,...  
But of course as I said in my post, native exchange tokens are really risky, especially when they are new and not used by a lot of people. TVL is at 1.8 billion so user base is getting a lot bigger. At the moment TITAN is still doing great. Had a few drops but keeps going up.   


As you said, the risk is still high. One of the advantages though is that the TITAN yield returns are continuously being sold. Both in autocompounding vaults and manually. Even for small amounts because the transaction cost is so low on polygon.  
It becomes more dangerous when lots of people start holding TITAN and then a whale decides to dump all of it causing FUD and a price drop.  


But I get why you left, there are definitely safer options (like AAVE and CURVE) out there but for the risk takers (and lets admit it, greedy people) among us, Iron Finance  is still a great way to get huge APR's  


However, Iron Finance still seems to have a lot of potential. There are 18k IRON holders and 13K TITAN holders right now. I feel like that is not the ceiling. But feelings can be wrong. TITAN could drop to 1$ today and you would be happy you got out, but it's also possible it grows for another couple of weeks to 100$ and then you might be sorry. Time will tell :-)",2021-06-14 17:35:49
Ehoro,"Don't be disingenuous. 

Many people do not understand tax. The article you're referring to doesn't specify that we should tax unrealized gains, it used the 'true tax rate' to get a point across about unequal sources of revenue. If you read the whole article you'd know that the bigger issue is utilizing assets at their market rate for collateral while not recognizing their value creating a taxable event + when being able to reset the cost basis to market rate upon death without having to ever  trigger the taxable event. And when you talk about those points it's more politics and finance, as the laffer curve never entered the discussion, and it is highly debated where the maximum efficient tax rate is anyway.


It is good to link FRED data, good stuff there. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881600Q
Employed full time: Median usual weekly real earnings: Wage and salary workers: 16 years and over

And your source 

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEPAINUSA672N
Real Median Personal Income in the United States

So the first one is relatively stagnant until Q2 2020, the second shows a net gain of 50% up until 2018.

Both can be true, and it's about how you look at data, there's a lot more information to be gathered here.

Do the FRED numbers include benefits tied to jobs, like vacation? Is it possible real median household wages are actually worse on a per hour worked basis, because (using random  numbers) 30 years ago there were 1.3 wage earners per household, now there are 1.6. It also does not include part time work, which may be worse off than full time employment in general?

From the personal income data, likewise does it account for the average amount of hours worked for these weekly wages? Maybe there's a story here, where business owners and self employed have been seeing gains but wage earners less so? ( the former dataset does not include self employed and business owners) Does CPI capture all the true costs tied to modern living, like being able to budget for your own retirement since there will likely be no pension for many of us?

I'm not trying to argue all the finer points, and fred data is great, but there's still a lot to read into it as well.",2021-06-14 19:18:26

While the 3k fin mods did not appeal to me (not very fond of all those markowitz, alpha beta stuff), I was interested in the 4k fintech mods (at that time I thought it was the closest alternative to BA mods).

However, I'm not so clear about the supply chain spec since I don't have any friends doing that and didn't take any related mods.

worldwide369,"Many great points so far, so I'll mention curve ball ideas that haven't been covered.

If water levels do continue to rise, you could maybe purchase land and build a house on it that is elevated, kind of like the old fashioned houses for when it floods.

Have a big ass plastic boat in storage for if it ever floods. Then you will fit right in with the floating markets  :-) 

Water wont be around forever during a flood, it's in many rich land owners and government property interests to keep the lands dry. They will surely want the BTS and Airport to stay dry.

As china continues to dam rivers up, maybe it will reduce chao praya river level flow? Speaking of China, if a dam was ever built from Hua Hin to Pattaya, it would probably be the chinese who finance the whole thing.

If you do purchase, and the payments are low, and then the property is worthless in 25 years, then you could have a bit of peace of mind by pretending that the monthly payments were just ""rent"" that you would have paid if you rented to begin with.

Humans are pretty clever, and have lived on water (venice) and near flood areas for thousands of years. The change is gradual, you will have time to prepare if you keep an eye on it. the riskier it gets, prices will reflect that, so maybe you can sell in 10-15 years?",2021-06-15 11:55:57

When you earn on Beefy you auto compound meaning you get more LP tokens you don't get the reward token. This can be good or bad..on stablecoin pools you get more stable coins that you redeem when you unstake - but if you want the titan token you have to stake on [iron.finance](https://iron.finance) and claim the rewards there manually (or whatever that auto vault thing is I'm not familiar with it).

After thinking about things today I pulled Iron/USDC out of Beefy and added more to stake directly on iron finance.  As I earn Titan I'm going to put more into the titan/matic pool on beefy to build up the riskier high yield position without having to risk my own capital.  The TVL on titan is continuing to rise and the iron token hasn't shown any indication of losing it's peg.

I'm shooting for \~85% in stable pools and 15% in the beefy pool for titan/matic.  Once I get my position I'll start selling for profit.

The platform is managed by a core team but it has a decentralized autonomous organization that is able to propose and vote for ways it should be changed, using Curve's governance token CRV.

proverbialbunny,"&gt;So does that mean Wall Street itself is a lie?

It depends what you're considering a lie.  Most of wall street is banks.. you know, loans, savings, and checking accounts.

The trading side of wall street has historically relied on 1) quantitative finance, eg arbitrage bots 2) hedge funds, aiming to reduce volatility not increase profits 3) and legal insider information.  Part of the job for many traders is going to bars and hearing the talk of the town.  Lucrative information leaks.  Eg, Citadel two days before AMC's announcement that blew up their stock, they bought a bunch of calls.  They made away like bandits.  Inside information runs rampant this part of wall street.

&gt;Cramer is just a confident idiot trying to see patterns in static.

If you study his recommendations he is a trend follower.  He says buy what has already gone up in the morning and says sell what has already gone down.  Outside of that he has a nearly 50/50 chance of being correct.

&gt;Cathie Wood and Bill Ackman are charismatic charlatans trying to fool investors into thinking they know what they're doing. 

Some people get it rich by making speculative bets that pay off.  This is part of the probability curve.  If you make speculative bets you'll win bigger than an index fund or lose bigger than an index fund.  The problem is when they win it big they do not step down.  The more trades one makes the more they are diversifying over time, so over time people like Cathie Woods will always end up at the top of the bell curve being no better than investing in an index fund.

&gt;Robinhood is a crime against humanity.

I'm pretty sure everyone knows that at this point.  The lying CEO who makes money off of hedge funds using trading data to predict the future using bots.

&gt;It's on par with the advent of heroin in terms of its devastating impact on human well-being. The addictive gamification of trading that Robinhood has brought us will be the downfall of millions. 

Uhh.. a bit harsh.  Like I mentioned earlier, speculative bets have a wide bell curve (lognorm curve technically) so if someone is young and has nothing to lose, why not make a few speculative bets?  If they lose everything they lose very little, if they win a lot they make a killing.  The downside is some of these kids don't know to stop.  You make a few trades.  If you win, you win.  Walk away.  Now you have something to lose.  Now is the time to move into VTI or whatever.  I wouldn't blame Robinhood on that.  Their trading style is legitimate and there are studies to back it up, as long as they walk away when the time is right.

wildheart38,"I changed. All along in Public Service. 

Was in Organization A for 1.5 years. 

In charge of the enforcement and contract management portfolio in the most dreary and insipid department ever (no, its not even HR or Finance). Not related to my field of studies and I remember sighing every morning, even on Fridays.  It was a retirement home basically - got pros and cons. You can actually knock off largely on time. Cruise along, but frustrated and not happy. Loads of office politics among the young staff and old staff. Bosses are clueless and loads of arrow (crafting knee-jerk SOPs, etc) towards young staff. Limited professional growth and only a rare chance to rotate out of the department to do the core work of the stat board, or even work that is of critical national importance.

Then Organization B came along with an offer at the start of 2020. Was thrilled because I had interned there as a Research intern (but in another department) before, and my position was also a Research Executive. So I naively thought it would be the same. 

To my horror, the work was completely research and work on legislation. Every job has its learning curve but if you are not trained in legal stuff, its a learning wall. It was not mentioned in the job description or interview that they were looking out for a candidate with legal background. Funnily during my exit interview, HR told me grimly that my position is a hot seat (meaning people quit every couple of months) and after I left, they updated the job description to specify that candidates with legal training can apply. I remember feeling very lost at work and my RO got impatient and personal with me. 

Organization C extended an offer 6 months after I joined Organization B , and because I thought I already had no future in Organization B, I joined despite my intuition having some reservations. 

I think I posted about my time in Organization C. I dont want to revisit those memories. Basically I went to Hell and back, and was on a verge of a mental breakdown. I lasted 2.5 months before resigning (including notice period). 

2020 was a horrible year for me. 

Now in Organization D and I am finally contented with my work. Its a 1 year non-renewable contract though (left with 4 months), and Im currently looking to reapply back to Organization D as a full time perm/contract with possibility of being emplaced as perm staff or something. 

On hindsight, shouldnt have left Organization A. Wasn’t happy but I think my time in Organizations B and C were worse. But hindsight is always 20/20 lah.",2021-06-18 14:01:32

Riusech,"¿ Qué son las Defi y por qué deberías saberlo ?  
Muy Posiblemente habrás oído hablar o habrás leído algún titular en prensa sobre las Defi y te habrás preguntado ¿qué son? . En este vídeo trataremos de explicarte en qué consisten.    
No dejes de visitar nuestra web pigmaliontrading.com y suscribirte a este canal para conocer más sobre el mundo cripto y otras oportunidades de inversión.  
‘DeFi’  Decentralized Finance significa Finanzas Descentralizadas en español.  
Las Defi han creado un ecosistema financiero descentralizado y global totalmente inclusivo (pues cualquier persona con un smartphone sin necesidad de cuenta bancaria puede acceder) justo y transparente, resistente a la fuerza, la censura y totalmente automatizado, sin la necesidad de intermediarios estériles que encarezcan, ralenticen o impidan las operaciones entre la comunidad , como sí ocurre en el sistema financiero tradicional, fuertemente centralizado.  
Las finanzas descentralizadas, aspiran a eliminar los bancos tradicionales y otros intermediarios de las operaciones financieras ya que son opacos, centralizados y difícilmente añaden ya nuevo valor. Las Defi hacen que el papel actual de los Bancos, los prestamistas o las Agencias de Seguros se desvanezca lentamente pues emulan en muchos casos las operaciones del sistema financiero tradicional, como los préstamos, pago o ganancia de intereses o el intercambio de divisas o moneda de forma descentralizada y atomatizada gracias a los contratos inteligentes que eliminan la necesidad de intermediarios.  
Estos contratos inteligentes se crearon en un principio sobre la red de Ethereum, de la que Vitalik Butherin Es el cocreador e inventor y descrita como la “combinación de una red descentralizada de minería digital y una plataforma de desarrollo de software”   
Ether, el nombre de su criptomoneda que es más conocida por el nombre de su red Ethereum seguro que la conocéis pues es la segunda criptomoneda más popular después de Bitcoin.  
Esta red actualmente aloja plataformas como Uniswap, SushiSwap y Curve Finance que es un protocolo de liquidez de intercambio descentralizado diseñado para el comercio extremadamente eficiente de stablecoins (criptomonedas estables normalmente al valor de 1 dólar estadounidense) y Bitcoin sintético para la red Ethereum donde se pueden obtener intereses por la participación en éstos además del intercambio totalmente privado de monedas y otros servicios financieros.  
Como veréis existen numerosas ventajas en las Defi con respecto a las finanzas tradicionalmente centralizadas, especialmente cuando los intereses obtenidos son sobre una stablecoin, una criptomoneda de valor estable lo que elimina el riesgo de pérdida de valor por la volatilidad de éstas, aunque obviamente existen otros riesgos que enumeraremos al final del vídeo.  
Si bien las Defi comenzaron a desarrollarse con fuerza en 2018 especialmente sobre Ethereum ha sido durante el último año 2020 y este 2021 cuando han vivido un verdadero Boom con un movimiento diario de miles de millones de dólares.  
Sin embargo diversos problemas relativos a la escalabilidad de Ethereum están actualmente afectando a los principales proyectos DeFi en esta red. Los altos costos de comisión y la  congestión son un problema real que ha provocado que otras redes Blockchain empiecen a ganar mayor visibilidad.   
Estas redes Blockchain descentralizadas con enorme potencial para el desarrollo de DeFi son Cardano, Polkadot, Avalanche, RSK o Celo.  
Sin embargo ha sido la Binance Smart Chain aunque se trate de una Red centralizada que pertenece al Exchange Chino Binance la que ha tenido un enorme éxito en materia de soporte para DeFi por la escalabilidad de su red y los bajos costos por operaciones de intercambio, aunque esta funcione de forma mucho más centralizada que las otras que ya os he citado, Binance lleva claramente la ventaja respecto a las demás y es actualmente rival directa de la red de Ethereum.  
Riesgos y desventajas de las Defi  
Las Aplicaciones Defi se ejecutan en Blockchains descentralizadas como Ethereum Aunque esto no implica que todos protocolos de las Defi sean totalmente descentralizados, ni siquiera todas las redes sobre las que operan como vimos en el caso de la Binance Smart Chain.  
El Espacio Defi está aún verde y en constante evolución Uniswap, dForce, Bancor, Balancer has sufrido hacks por vulnerabilidad en sus Smart Contracts.  
Este estado inicial de desarrollo del entorno Defi implica también que la dificultad para el aprovechamiento de todas las posibilidades y servicios que nos ofrecen  es notable aún. Las Defi no son aún para todo el mundo, queda mucho camino por recorrer en el desarrollo de entornos más intuitivos y ‘user friendly’ que faciliten el acceso al usuario medio, algo aún lejos de ser una realidad.  
Otro riesgo ha sido las numerosas estafas que se han dado como es el caso de TurtleDex en la red de Binance, pues aprovechan la codicia de algunos usuarios aún poco informados que corren a lograr los retornos prometidos para su capital.  
Aún así la seguridad en Blockchain una vez se vayan superando los escollos propios del estado de temprano desarrollo de las defi es altísimo.

Filipe_G21,"A Buyback providers more flexibility, but this does not exclude completely the possibility for a burn. 

For instance, we provide farming rewards for aETHc/ETH liquidity providers on Curve Finance and many of our employees receive Ankr tokens vested for 6 months as part of their compensation. Other options are possible as long as it does not involve buying Ankr token to sell it right after.

However, a locking mechanism seems more attractive to us than the only Buyback and/or Burn at the moment as we can integrate token locking to some products that we are developing.",2021-06-19 02:19:03
No_Effort_244,"Very well put! I read your recent post on r/CryptoCurrency and was curious to find out more - I am a couple of weeks into my crypto journey, and my learning curve has been stuck at around 89.5 degrees! 

One of the advantages of being a total ""noob"" is that you get a non-biased view of the various factions in the crypto world. Tribalistic is a good word, but I would go so far as calling it a Zoo :)

Some observations from a noob: Clan BTC are convinced of their superiority by fact of being the ""original and best"" coin, and all alt-coins are simply ""shitcoins"". Let's just say that this is not the most welcoming of environments for us noobs, so I quickly exited from there. 

Clan ETH: Much more of a community spirit here, and I was quickly sucked into the project with all the current and future work towards making ETH the top dog in the Crypto world (The various scaling solutions and eventually ETH 2.0). All very exciting. I also dabbled in the world of de-fi via the Polygon side-chain (a cost -effective way of learning the ropes with small amounts!). Forget the zoo - this is a real jungle, complete with crocs and anacondas lurking in the swamp! I have only been doing this for about a week and already been witness to the multi-billion dollar implosion of titan finance! Weekly rug-pulls are par for the course, and nobody even bats an eyelid. A great many gambling-types are being attracted here by the continuous inflating of coin-bubbles and funny tokens at silly APYs. So many sad tales of woe are the net result.  Being risk-averse, this is probably not the place for me.

Clan ADA: To be fair, I haven't spent much time looking into it, but so far I also get a sense that ""Cardashians"" have a distinct  holier than thou attitude towards others and I am still not quite sure what's the point..

Clan Nano: a refreshing welcoming attitude seems to prevail here! I am still learning about the coin, seems to be the friendly underdog-coin, which I can totally get behind. Un-pretentious is also a quality I like, along with the clearly-stated purpose of aiming to be a transactional coin that ANYONE can use as a currency instead of HODLing to infinity and beyond. 

I took the first steps and installed a wallet and used the faucet to get some Nano - it was a doddle, even for a noob! Very impressed by the speed. I will be hanging out here for a while, learning and hopefully contributing what I can at some point. Cheers!",2021-06-19 02:51:28
tulumex,"Mark Cuban has done a lot of positive for the community the last several weeks and it wouldn't be fair to throw him under the bus for any comments regarding regulation. Deep, down, I also support regulation, mostly because I'd rather we get ahead of the curve and lobby for favorable regulations instead of waiting for a scenario where bad regulations are forced upon us. Under the Biden administration, the SEC has been cautious not to disrupt financial innovation and we need to use this opportunity to help them shape the future.

In my opinion, here's one way to think about regulations. One of the most valuable principles of DeFi is that everything is open source. The code and logic for every DeFi app you interact with is published online. This means that, in theory, anyone auditing the code can come up with every possible way the app can be used and misused. In theory, what can go wrong can be predicted in advance. The right type of auditor could have predicted what could go wrong with Titan finance.

Supposedly, our tax dollars finance some of the most advanced Computer Scientists working for the NSA and other government agencies. Since we're already financing coding and other software R&amp;D, there's no reason out tax dollars shouldn't support regulatory agencies who can audit DeFi programs and make the public aware of the risks. Instead of taking the risk of creating regulations which cause a chilling effect and slow down innovation, the government can be active in development and make the public aware of bad code. Since code is logical and transparent, it would decrease the risk of political opinions affecting audit: any risk identified needs to be supported with math and logic.

I'm not saying this is the right way, but this is how I'd lobby the government so that we can move towards creating protections without hurting innovation.",2021-06-19 07:39:33
thomgloams,"This got crazy long. Sorry. I'll put some key points in a reply after this. 
In the meantime, look into how you can figure out if a project is over or under valued by the time you get to it.
-MCap/TVL ratio only a piece of the puzzle
-FDV/TVL is the other (fully diluted value) ratio.
-If both of these are low, less than 1, that's usually good thing.
-Examine the "" Charts "" page and compare different pairs to get a feel for why several metrics are similar yet one has 10k in fees a day and other has 60k. There are several red herrings you'll see. For example, the most swapped coins are the most liquid ones (gas coin , ETH always, and native junk token) and generate the most fees but also attract the most users so you're sharing with more ppl. 
Look up spreadsheets you can just plug numbers into. 
-always check the native token holders wallets on polyscsn. See how many the whales hold. Besides the contract wallets, can 1 whale disrupt the whole thing if they sell?  Look for better distro among holders. 

Take screenshots at every stage before, during and while compounding. I guarantee you will forget what you started with and if the payments are accurate. Compare screenshots with each other. 

Obviously, impermanent loss. This is covered tons of places here. I'll leave that out.  But NATIVE + USDC will incur ALOT of IL swings.  USDT+USDC hardly any.  Then everything in between. 
-The general total Crypto market sentiment matters if you should hold off or rush in. 

Go with Blue Chips if you want to set and forget and just peek in now and again. Low risk low rewards but better than any bank.
Wanna play? Then you gotta be on top of the platforms all day, and have a plan B ready to execute in case you have to exit. You don't wanna waste time doing a whole new vetting process.  Have a backup always. 
- There are fantastic tracker apps to use.
I love yfat

TLDR

May I ask what you expect or hope to experience?  I'm not being snarky I promise you. I'm truly asking bc it seems like none of the responses here are giving any indication that they have an "" expected ROI "" per day/week/month that one calculates on their own before depositing, then see if the numbers match once you begin.  And also, when I see 364% APY my eyes light up too. But it's an exponential distro which means the curve is boring and slow at first, but after TIME, the steep rise appears. But TIME, you don't have. It's a fact we will not realize that 354% interest bc it takes a year to reach it. 
Do a web search for compound interest images and you'll see no matter what the APR/Y is, the curve gets explosive over halfway thru. Or look at an interest table and you'll see it as well.  
The more capital you start with, then the more you gains WILL BE PERCEIVED to be.  1% of 10,000 is $100. That's meaningful to most ppl per day. 1% of 500 is $5.  Much less meaningful even tho it's still 1%. Don't fall for the idea that gains are gains. Bc we still live in a system of accepted value attached to things we need. 
$5 a day + 7 days is $35 a week.  That is TONS TONS more than you'll ever see from a bank. But is it worth the hours of research, farming, reading etc etc.?  Maybe maybe nott.
$100 a day + 7 days is $700 a week.  Well I don't know about you but that's pretty meaningful to me all of a sudden.  That's some life upgrade money if it's regular (it's not) , don't care if you're rich or poor. Everyone can grow $700 free money a week into something way bigger.  So is 1% = to 1% ? Sure.  But the impact is drastically different between 10k and $500. 

TL;DR

I'll be the first to admit that I haven't a clue how it truly truly works beyond the real basic stuff. You know why? It's intentional. It's kept vague in every tokenomics doc. These are old school centralized banking methods under cover of cute graphics and themes. 

It IS real though.. This is how banks make billions. The capital comes from us. The tons of ppl putting in $500, $1000, $2500 etc. It all goes into a pool aka a Money Market. The devs can now leverage millions for a nice return and simply shave off the LP 0.25% fees to all providers. But it's only temporary.  Once the new money stops flowing in, the fun stops. And you gotta get out quickly. 
Just look at any DeFi token chart on tracker apps and you'll see the wild unpredictable nature of these native tokens. 

So, native tokens. It's price is meaningless. It's decided by the circulating supply devs choose divided into the gross amount we invest into the platform + the pre-live capital they raise before going public. Basically this is the initial Market Cap + number of coins (shares) outstanding.  5,000,000 capital let's say.  They could choose to mint 1000 native tokens to give an "" rich "" price of $5000 per token.  Or they can mint 100,000 for a price of $50 to make it seem affordable. Doesn't matter. It has no value except for the day 1 - day 10 or so ppl who ape in whatever they have, get the token rewards ASAP and swap into Stable coin right away.  

This causes price to go down steadily since no smart money or experienced degen is going to HODL that coin. They know it's going to correct fast as supply goes up + minting + ineffective burns + they are REMOVING LIQUIDITY from the pool each time they lock in profit dumping the useless Cat or dog or booboo or doodoo token back to the pool and taking out stablecoins. 

At the same time, tier 2 ppl are reading about the PolyXYZ buzz so they check it out and see the attractive price of the native token so they dump in more actual liquidity, in the hopes that the 357% APY will make them rich quickly since that's like 3 tokens a day x $50 or whatever the price is.  However, they get attached to the project and emotionally vested in the Diamond Hands mentality, and they hoard the native booboo token. Price go up. 

But you're not earning value, you're earning the token + a tiny cut of fees. As your farming grows the price (more or less) seems stable until a whale calls it and swaps 50k of it. On small projects, this will cause a chain reaction and those 6.3688 shooshoo s you were banking on as being $50 ea are now $5 ea.  Sucks but not bad. 

Then tier 3 comes in and sees all this action and they prop up the project a bit longer.  The devs are going hard now, marketing and advertising and creating a buzz for vroovycakes . It's hip to be hodling them. 

You ever see the math functions that the fee distro and rewards are based on? They print it clear as day with a verbal explanation.... Which is fine if you have a Masters Degree in Economics and finance from fkin MIT. It's complete gibberish to any normal, even high IQ person. It APPEARS to be transparent but it's cloaked bc: 

THEY KNOW that only a tiny fraction of ppl MIGHT understand it (these are the MIT graduates) and think it's cute that we, ppl who are NOT master mathematicians think we have any idea how it all actually works. 

BUT you can get a feel for the patterns. Think about it, how long did it take to get 200 POLY-CLONE platforms up? Like locusts.  Fast. The deposit fee here, the performance fee there, the withdrawal fee etc all is priced in.  You can surely come out on top but you need to understand the basic dance, timing, and to not kid yourself that any of these projects are trying to pay you out of the kindness of their heart. And this, these are the nice ones.  I haven't even discussed risks of bad code, rugs, functions that can change dynamically, who controls the pools, it's ENDLESS. 

Don't get me wrong tho - this is not "" malicious "" per se. They tell you upfront you can lose it all.  But we are blinded by the hopes of high returns. 
But guess what?  These returns are only valid OVER TIME.  Compound interests are EXPONENTIAL in that you don't really see the magic until you cross into the law of large numbers area. Yet the one thing you don't have is TIME.  WE ALL KNOW 90% of these things last a month or two tops.  By then the googoo token is worth fractions and the APY has gradually decreased over this time. You are wondering where the gains are... 

There are good ones that last longer but the only reason for that is marketing and good social media presence to keep a constant inflow of fresh capital.  Ignore the special burn rates, lock times, and all the things that they try to stand out from the others. They are all just complex finance formulas with the same end goal.  Make alot of money, re distro some of it to users, to keep them happy and let it ride as long as it will sustain itself. 

So you're wondering still, how are all these ppl on reddit making the big gainz in DeFi?  Well first, you can't trust everything you read. That being said, there are many ppl who have a whole year of DeFi experience where they know what to look for and maybe not exactly how it works but you can start to make educated inferences on the data you CAN interpret. 

This is crazy long. Sorry. I'll put some key points next reply.",2021-06-19 12:58:40
xB_I-O_S,"I farmed cake when APY was 30k%. Not trying to brag just saying. It might not be a scam you might just be early. While finding farms, try to find out if and what project they forked. If that was a success, this might be too on a different network. Cake ist just an uniswap clone at it’s core. Ellipsis finance forked curve finance code and had 3k% APY in the beginning. I farmed that because they airdropped me tokens for my vote-locked curve. Stay away from 2-3gen clones, manage risk and bet LOW. Also auto compounding yield optimizer like beefy finance and autofarm or any other are great for farming these high volatility pools. Mostly they reach these high APY from these auto compounding mechanisms. Make a farming wallet to keep your funds safe while you invest in these new projects. Also try fantom or polygon, BSC is not lucrative right now imo.",2021-06-19 13:13:38

thomgloams,"Hey glad my absurdly long post was helpful for you. After reading your reply tho I think there are alot of plays out there that have reasonable and sustainable ROI ESPECIALLY compared to a bank, and the risk is minimal with blue chips. 
Not financial advice but what I ended up doing was splitting my funds into 3 parts. 50% stable pair like USDC-USDT (or DAI) which will much lessen the IL problem to almost nil.  One can find modest returns (20-40%) on these pairs on sushi, beefy, polycat and wault.  Curve finance also good but complex.  These platforms have been around long enough one can harvest and restake the rewards to get exposure to some more upside (and risk)
Then i take 25% funds (usually core coins like eth, wbtc, and MATIC) and do some decent yield single asset vaults preferable one that rewards in like kind. Might do a pair as well if the markets are nice and liquid and price isn't all nuts like it is now in market. 

Then I sorta play degen with the remaining 25%. Usually scout out newer things and follow up to launch, follow the socials, read the docs do some math and basically just dump whatever looks high and risky.  I watch the native token closely, watch the bug holders and just soak up what I can and lock in profit 2x week.  If anything goes wacky I'm already prepared to be satisfied with what I returned and just assess if I need to make any moves. 

The bread and butter tho is the stable pairs (at least for now) cuz it's generally low math risk. (Just the typical risk of hacks etc) . Oh and I'm only working w a portion of my overall. 

I hate the saying don't risk what you can't lose, bc I hate losing regardless. So I try to limit it and keep a number in mind. I'm not gonna be ok going to zero and I'm not gonna get rich going to 100 but the plan is to find a modest place in the middle.  

PS you should check out Hodlnaut too. Msg me if you want the gist. But I love them and awesome stable returns on 5 major coin.
Cheers and good luck!",2021-06-19 14:42:23
thomgloams,"Guh. This means you can afford to lose 500k.  Which means you have traditional Investments prob valued around 1M at least. Then the emergency fund. Kudos. For real. But less than 0.1% of us can even comprehend that.  500k? Sure.  Risking 500k in risky  DeFi with highly volatile assets?  No. That's called play money. 

Again, congrats tho for real.  But I need to point out that yes on paper 60% = 60% but the value doesn't translate. Money is equal to all of us from $0 to about $1000. Every one of us could survive if we had no choice other than $1000 month. 

10k a month is cushy for some but just right for others. 
100k you instantly see the gap open up.  That's where wealthy ppl are used to having to spend 100k a month just for the services they use. 
Other ppl, 100k a month is like the lottery. 

Law of large numbers. 

So sure 1‰ of $1000 is $10. Can't do anything with that. In 7 days that's $70. That's gas, maybe grocery, basics. We all spend that same and it's not meaningful.

1% of 100,000 is relativly  same but now that's equal to $1000 a day. $7000 week.  That is a major upgrade to most ppls lives and a stress ava worry reducer on orders of magnitude.  For the wealthy it can simply just be the cost of living modestly bc the car payments, house, house 2 &amp; 3, services, etc just cost that much. It's easy less significant. 

Point is 60% gains are not all equal in actual value delivered. Is highly dependent on lifestyle and where time put in meets the reward.  So ppl should keep this in mind and , in a single instance, only use percent to calc your risk reward and know your up and downside.  But then watch your gains losses in fiat once they become useful and only until they become arbitrary. 

Not a single one of these DeFi projects will last long enough for any average person to actually see 1 full year of projected APY realized. And don't forget the curve for compounding is not linear. It starts off slow and flat for 2/5ths the time.  Then the interest finally skips a digit at 3/5s time. That's the catalyst. But it's not til 4th and 5th zone do you see the money mooning.  Most will not make it that long before the protocol fizzle out. 

So ask yourself, do you want decent money tmrw which could also mean you get rugged, hacked, human error, contact fault etc 
Or do you want no realized gains now cuz you don't need them but in 10-15 years you are pretty much guaranteed 7% gains compounded. Hundred of thousands potentially vs. a hundred or so now.  (The answer is leave money to your future self. In return, your future self will give you access to smart debt and leverage.

DeFi is great and all but it's no different than the central banks bc the exact same formulas and Liquidity mining (high yield Money Market funds aka pools) 
The banks advertising for you to open a savings account every other week is the same as devs shilling their pooboo deedioo token with ads and cute pics.  When you open a savings account you are giving the bank thousands that they can play with, fully insured. In return you get crumbs, if that.
These ideas and formulas are made to grow large sums for the banks (devs) and keep the customers just happy enough to keep pouring in thousands of hard cash that they (banks and dev) get for the cost of NADA. 0.1% or 0.25% fees re distro. 

We will never know the exact model, it's too complex and designed by graduate students of finance. With DeFi tho, you get the added "" benefit "" of no one to help, having to become a skilled account, banker, security guard, trader, mathematical scholar as well.  Who the hell wants that? 

We don't.  But them gains!  We can't resist",2021-06-19 19:38:24
magus678,"&gt;But when you asked the moms, 97% of them claimed that they were doing most of the work.

Here is a different survey with similar results about who splits what on dates and household costs. At every delineation women think they pay more than men think they pay. At the largest, where the men paying all vs the women paying none, the gap of acknowledgement is almost double. Which would be a tough one to really get wrong.

https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/infographic-pays-nerdwallet-study-finds-gender-roles-remain-strong-couples/

Interestingly enough, I am fairly sure this article used to be larger and more damning, but they have shortened it quite a bit and the link to read all the data is now 404. 

[Here is another](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-08/asa-seb080913.php) more academic study that found:

&gt;*Consistent with conventional norms, most men (84 percent) and women (58 percent) reported that men pay for most expenses, even after dating for a while. Over half (57 percent) of women claim they offer to help pay, but many women (39 percent) confessed they hope men would reject their offers to pay, and 44 percent of women were bothered when men expected women to help pay.*

84% vs 58% with that kind of sample size really points to a systemic gap. And while anecdotal, I am fairly sure my own experiences would hold up against actual data that women most certainly *do not* offer to pay over half the time. 

Women do seem to largely exist in a bubble that grades themselves on some sort of curve; they really do seem to believe they are being more egalitarian than they are.",2021-06-19 19:54:55

MetaMask is not user friendly. There’s no doubt about it that Trust Wallet is designed to make everything easier however if you’re using Trust Wallet on iOS the new update will remove your dapp feature and you can’t get it back. You’ll have e to rely on “wallet connect” and that can be a serious pain sometimes. 

Also, Trust is great for BSC, but won’t be compatible with Polygon and Fantom. 

MetaMask is a switch you have to make if you are serious about getting involved in any other networks. MetaMask on a computer is easier than MM on a phone. 

If you ever want to set up a new network on MM, do an internet search for “MetaMask setup (network name)” and there will be a medium post that walks you through it like the one I have posted above.

Volfefe,"If the goal is a high paying job, then I think there are a couple of options.  As someone that graduated around median from a T50 that was the top ranked in the state, my experience in the job market was not pleasant. With your grades, you probably won’t get anything from OCI (if your career services even lets your resume get through;  they plucked out ones that didn’t meet firms GPA requirements).  You basically are going to be working very hard to get grades up and hustle for a job the next two years.  I would seriously consider adding another degree to the JD or dropping out to pursue another graduate program.  It is going to be a lot easier and less work to study for the GMAT/GRE and do a graduate program that won’t fuck you with a curve and has good exit options.  I would look at MBAs, Masters in finance/data analytics/software development.  UVA has a masters of commerce program I desperately wish I had found out about before law school.  I am now considering going part time to get a Masters in Data Analytics at Duke/Berkeley/UVA.  I work at a big 4s consulting/advisory arm and we cannot hire people with data analytics degrees fast enough.  These programs will also actually help you get a job.  Your law schools career office is just going to tell you to go network…. They really are only good for helping students get big law jobs and clerkship, which only the students with great GPAs even qualify for.

If you decide to stay, I think there are two paths you can look at that may help you get a large salary later (but not straight out of law school).  First, you can try to get a job on the hill as a staffer for a senator or congressperson.   You would need to start networking now.  If your school is in or close to DC this is a viable option.  I would just intern as much as possible and try to get a job as a legislative aide after law school.  It won’t pay a lot initially but if you work for the right committees/senators/congressperson you can get a job as a lobbyist or in a in-house government affairs role.

Second, get your grades up and try to get a job at a boutique or gov agency (you will probably only qualify for state level work) that does big lawish type of work.  Look for firms that are made up of old big law partners.  They will care less about grades, and I have seen people make a jump to the mid-law and regional big law firms from there.  For the government work, look for attorney general offices that do employment law, insurance, environmental or another field that the big law firms have practice areas in.  This is not a sure bet path and some of the small law firms can realllyyyyy suck to work for.  Remember, everyone is going to be applying for jobs and the only real differentiators employers have is grades, pre law school work experience (if any), and connections.

My experience with being around median grades wise sucked big time.  The market is way too crowded and going to the T50 was not as big of a differentiator than I expected.  I lost out to the local T3 candidates in a lot of cases just because they had an alumni connection.  The T50 really only seemed to get a couple more big law firms at oci than the T3.  But that only helps if you are in the top 15% of the class…",2021-06-20 23:50:41
WorshipTheSunGods,"&gt; There is almost no crypto whose price is based on its demand in a certain application atm. 

Aave, yEarn, comp, curve and maker vaults all have TVL ranging from multi-hundred millions to billions. Look at this:

https://defipulse.com/yearn.finance

TVL in yEarn vaults has been increasing non-stop, even post-crash. And if this isn't a viable metric then look at tokens which generate revenue:

https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/protocol-revenue

These tokens are literally generating revenue that goes straight to liquidity providers, stakers and lenders. There are tokens that have value due to rooted fundamentals - a huge shift from the paradigm in 2017 where your statement would have been correct and demand was dominated by solely by speculation. But we now have other applications arising which do give tokens intrinsic value and this should not be forgotten.",2021-06-21 01:54:09
Anlarb,"&gt; Yes, you can learn a more in demand skill.

An individual can, the bottom 50% of wage earners can't all clown car into plumbing.

&gt; nah. there is no conspiracy here.

Never attribute to malice that which can be attributed to incompetence.

&gt; People move into and out of income brackets. You can take a snapshot of the country at any given decade and say these people are middle class, but its rather pointless because it will be an entirely different set of people a decade later or a decade before.

Thats nice and has nothing to do with the point- this pots still boiling, frog.

&gt; If you want to talk about consumption levels, sure. The middle class consumes more now than ever before.

What specifically are you talking about, per capita? Are you defining rich as the middle class?

&gt; If GDP grows 7% a year for a decade, the standard of living for people in the middle class 10 years from will be double what it is today. But it won't be the same people.

Guy, ""same people"" is a red herring. Median wage is 34k, thats Poor.

https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/family-finance/articles/where-do-i-fall-in-the-american-economic-class-system

&gt; You can have all the free time you want. Just depends on what material standard of living you're comfortable with.

Sure, as a bum living under a bridge you can, but being homeless takes 40 years off your life expectancy.

If you want things, you need enough money to pay for them, thats what a living wage does.

&gt; There are supply constraints. In my neighborhood, you can't add more housing because the area is low density zoned. So the price of an additional unit is effectively infinitely high. The supply curve is effectively vertical. Plenty of room for speculation.

We could try punishing speculation, get investors back into the business of investing in factories and other profitable endeavors, instead of just beating the middle class like a pinata.",2021-06-21 08:04:55

Right now it’s very clear we are in a downturn (and might be for some time) so I wanted to say that there’s nothing wrong with converting your crypto to stablecoins and using them on defi protocols to gain interest. Right now it’s not a bad strategy and there are some big liquidity incentives happening on Matic (Polygon) using Curve Finance, AAVE, and Kyber Network (“Rainmaker” liquidity boost pending June 30th). These are all battle-tested, reliable protocols with competent teams - and Polygon has such low fees that folks like us can make a ton of transactions for nothing.

Fatigued_Otter,"Thank you for your kind words. As far as balance not moving, its the same as paying $500/mo interest payments on credit cards, $500/mo interest payments on mortgages, and $500/mo interest payments on cars. Mathematically there’s no difference, you’re in a contract with a rate and your balance is just a function of the payments you make or don’t make. That’s not the question here. 

If you take out a car loan or mortgage you cannot afford, this will also happen, just like taking out student loans that you cannot afford. Tangent, but the biggie (and imo, atrocity, though I understand it was to get enough political will to pass the NDEA circa 1958ish mid-Cold War) is the lack of discharge in bankruptcy.

Student loan forgiveness would be great, but the reality is even if that happens there will be people taking them out in the future as well. So the question for me is longer-sighted than forgiveness, it’s where does our system go wrong as a root cause? Is it that student loans of that magnitude and interest simply shouldn’t have been offered because they are not collectible? And if so, do people enter into them because the perceived value of certain degrees is inflated? Or is it because they are not aware of the nature of the obligation (eg can’t discharge in bankruptcy, seeing a payment schedule)? Or do we lack education in personal finance (“if I borrow money can I pay it back, and how to I do that math?”) A combo of the above?

The next question of course is how do you amend policy to fix it going forward. Lowering the interest rate and/or capping amounts that can be loaned seems easy, but would have to be offset with federal tax hikes elsewhere to pay for the subsidy (ideally with a more progressive tax curve, though we’ve seen it’s frustratingly difficult to get the political will to do that). 

Thoughts?",2021-06-22 07:06:40
Kashmir79,"There is definitely something to the idea that as a company grows larger and scales up the index into the mega cap zone, it has proportionally less room to grow relative to the total market cap and therefore lower return potential. For example, with a $2.2 trillion valuation, Apple can only grow roughly another 25x before it represents the value of the entire US stock market so that is the upper limit of its growth. But a smaller company could easily grow 10,000x and then some. So an optimal weighting that accounts for the greater growth potential of smaller companies is probably going to look something like an elongated bell curve, with the apex somewhere amidst the large caps. But this is well outside my very modest knowledge of finance and there are thousands of brilliant mathematical minds studying it every day so have to I’ll leave it to them to figure out the right models and just stick with what I can get from my 401k.",2021-06-22 11:00:13

US markets reversed some of last week end’s price action with the cyclicals sector up strongly to recoup some of Friday’s losses - which was seen in the indices with the Dow gaining the most. Moves were prompted by the market reassessing the pace of tightening along with comments from Powell that the current high inflation print is transitory.

Gains were seen in financials, energy, industrials &amp; materials - the bank sector gained the most as the yield curve reversed some of its flattening with the 2 year down to 0.25% &amp; the 10 year up 3 bps to 1.48%.

European stocks gained with the Euro Stoxx down 0.7%. The DAX was up 1% to 15,603, the CAC was up 0.5% to 6,602 &amp; the FTSE was up 0.6% to 7,062.

Gallusrostromegalus,"Related Things that could definitely be mistaken as ""Cursed By Genius"", that are way, WAY more common:

\-Having ADHD, Autism or another major learning disorder which can give you a weird advantage at academics, but you still feel the loneliness of being ND in a Neurotypical world.

\-Having ADHD/Autism and having a hyperfixation that is considered 'intellectual' (chess, calculus, latin, etc) but not that common.  It leads to feeling isolated because it's hard to find friends that share your interests/bond with people that don't and having a superiority complex which is a nasty combo to get out of.

\-Having a hyperfixation not generally considered 'intellectual' (NASCAR, card games, klingon etc.) and feeling isolated because it's hard to find friends that share your interest/bond with people who don't, and an inferiority complex, which is even worse.

\-Having anxiety and overthinking everything

\-Having anxiety and constantly feeling like you're the only person taking anything seriously enough.

\-Having low emotional intelligence and getting frustrated when you can't reason your way through basic social interactions

\-Having really high social intelligence and being great at social interactions, but also like you're constantly doing the heavy lifting for other people instead of the mutualism they all get to expirience

\-being really skilled at something that's in very high demand (Programming, electrical work, finance, art, education, home repair etc.) which gets you a ton of attention but also can leave you feeling like there's a ton of work to be done and you're the only one up for it, if only someone else would learn this and come help.  not to mention how this acts as a beacon for choosing beggars and people who want you to work for free, which is also frustrating.

\-Being an absolute fucking moron and not sharp enough to realize that the reason nobody thinks the way you are is because you're a moron, not a genius. (AKA, ""wrong end of the bell curve syndrome"")

Every real Genius I've ever met- people who are genuinely great at a wide range of skills, sharp-witted and intellectually curious- know that there is no such thing as a truly stupid person, just someone who knows different things than you-even your most fuckwitted friend knows how to do stuff you don't, are PROFOUNDLY AWARE they don't know everything and are really, really glad to know people who have wildly different life expiriences and skillsets than they do, because as one of my polymath friends put it ""I have three degrees and NONE of them can help me fix a broken toilet"".

So I don't think ""Cursed by Genius"" is real because real geniuses are aware they're also idiots, but ""Cursed by Undiagnosed Mental Health Issue"" and ""Cursed by Poor Social Skills"" sure as hell are.",2021-06-22 18:36:43

everynewdaysk,"**Oil prices are likely to keep rising toward $100 a barrel while a cool-off in commodity prices won’t last,** leaders of key firms said at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday. The head of Royal Dutch Shell Plc said governments will need to help companies cut customer emissions.  
  
Earlier, one of Deutsche Bank AG’s top shareholders signaled his backing for consolidation in Europe’s financial services industry, arguing that the continent’s lenders need scale to compete globally. Billionaire investor Michael Novogratz said he prefers Bitcoin to buying gold.  
  
The three-day event kicked off on Monday, with billionaire investor Ray Dalio and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers telling the Forum the U.S. is headed for a period of overheating and inflation that could threaten the recovery.  
  
The Qatar Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Investment Promotion Agency Qatar and Media City Qatar are underwriters of the Qatar Economic Forum, Powered by Bloomberg.  
  
**Commodity Cool-Off Won’t Last, Glencore CEO Says (7:30 p.m. Doha)**  
Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive officer of Glencore Plc, told the Forum that Chinese efforts to cool commodity markets, including releasing metals from its strategic stockpile, will be short lived.  
  
Glasenberg said China’s efforts are a “short-term phase” and that the country will have to move to restock strategic supplies that it feeds into the market in order to cool prices. Glasenberg said he expects commodity prices to stay strong for a good while longer, with both China and the U.S. stimulating their economies.  
  
For the first time in over a decade China has pledged to release metals stockpiles if it needs to. While planned sales to end users in China could help boost domestic supply, analysts have questioned the country’s ability to influence any uptick in copper demand seen elsewhere.  
  
Ben van Beurden, chief executive officer of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, said the company can probably fulfill stringent new targets for its carbon emissions: at a push, he can see a “pathway” to cutting them 45% by 2030, as mandated recently by The Hague.  
  
But he cautioned that it would a “different story” if the oil major is obligated to tackle emissions by its customers -- known as Scope-3. Shell can go some of the way by innovating new products and tweaking its business model, van Beurden said, but the “lion’s part” will come down to government policies. These could include measures that encourage the adoption of electric vehicles.  
  
“This is not a challenge for one company,” van Beurden said at Forum on Tuesday. “It is a systems challenge that we all have to embrace.”  
  
**Qatar Reveals Multiple Bids for LNG Expansion Project (7:10 p.m. Doha)**   
Qatar has received interest from prospective investors in its project to expand liquefied natural gas production amounting to double what it was seeking, said Energy Minister Saad Al-Kaabi.  
  
Royal Dutch Shell PLC, TotalEnergies SE and Exxon Mobil Corp. were among the companies that submitted bids to partner on the project, he said. The project will lift Qatar’s annual LNG output to 110 million tons from 77 million tons, and LNG buyers have offered to receive “double what we require,” he said.  
  
**Oil Prices to Keep Rising, Energy Bosses Say (7 p.m. Doha)**  
The leaders of some of the world’s biggest oil companies said crude prices are likely to keep rising as a lack of investments affects future supply, joining major commodity traders and banks in predicting the current rally has more room to run.  
  
**There’s “quite a chance” crude will reach $100 a barrel, TotalEnergies SE Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said at the Forum.**  
  
The energy transition means there has not been enough investment in oil and gas projects and that could push prices higher, Qatar’s Energy Minister Saad Al-Kaabi said.  
  
**Novogratz: Long-Bitcoin Trumps Long-Gold (11:25 a.m. Doha)**  
**Billionaire investor Novogratz said he looks at Bitcoin as “digital gold.” “If you’re going to be long gold, Bitcoin is a better version because it’s got the same macro tailwinds but it is also very early in the adoption curve.”**  
  
“Crypto is a luxury in the developed markets, it’s a necessity in the developing markets, where you’ve got currencies that devalue 20% to 30% every year,” Novogratz said. For the general user of crypto, though, Bitcoin and Ethereum is “probably enough,” he said.  
  
Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital, said on the same panel that there are a lot of good crypto products besides Bitcoin to invest in. “This year, Bitcoin is up 34%, our hedge fund that trades the liquid tokens is up 240%,” he said.  
  
“Ethereum is the second-biggest, it’s very important.”  
  
**Binance CEO Says Crypto Market Still Healthy (11:10 a.m. Doha)**  
“It’s very hard to tell” why the currencies have been dropping, Binance Holdings CEO Changpeng Zhao said in an interview, citing positive news like El Salvador adopting Bitcoin and negative headlines such as China cracking down on the currency. “From our perspective, we just see people placing orders.”  
  
China’s intensifying cryptocurrency crackdown has left Bitcoin flirting with $30,000, a price level seen as key to the short-term outlook for the largest virtual currency.  
  
Masters Sees $10 Trillion Fintech Opportunity (11:05 a.m. Doha)  
Technologies that integrate the finance industry’s disparate networks offer an outsized investment opportunity, according to Blythe Masters, CEO of Motive Capital.  
  
The opportunity to develop “platform-like businesses that connect broad networks” is particularly exciting for financial services, Masters said during a panel discussing fintech, adding that the sector has lagged “in terms of the disruption that platform businesses can bring to this space.”  
  
The potential market is vast. “More than one in every four dollars that are spent on technology are spent on financial technology by both financial firms and non-financial firms,” Masters said. “That adds up to about a $10 trillion market opportunity.”

It sounds illogical but it's the yield curve flattening. There are a ton of trade tactics that you actually want to be LONG on 20+ year treasuries such as the [barbell strategy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbell_strategy)

&gt;In finance, a barbell strategy is formed when a trader invests in long- and short-duration bonds, but does not invest in intermediate-duration bonds. This strategy is useful when interest rates are rising; as the short term maturities are rolled over they receive a higher interest rate, raising the value

In this case with TLT/TMF the Fed's hawkish signal shows they're not going to let inflation get out of control and so yields dropped, which raises bond prices! There is less inflation fear in the market.",2021-06-23 12:04:43

In a recent r/finance post about Japan (https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/nyq2xv/saving_japan_from_fiscal_collapse/), there was a lot of tut-tutting about Japan's supposed inhumane working conditions, how it led to low birth rate and a supposed fiscal collapse. Nobody seemed to notice the irony; even if you ignore official OECD statistics that show that the Japanese actually work less hours than the Americans and the Canadians, you must have noticed that Corporate America pushes onto you the similar BS that you'd generally attribute to a Japanese conglomerate, just packaged in different colors. The difference is much narrower than you imagine.

I guess that's not terribly relevant, but it is funny that we have another area of comparison where the US is rapidly closing its gap with Japan; national debt.

Alex-From-The-North,"From a pure money-driven standpoint, I would not be sure if it is even possible to finance an expensive deck by winning packs or prices in FNMs.

I totally get your point, but I would think that the average expected value of doing well in Tournaments is not enough to buy you a collection within a reasonable amount of time. Thats at least the experience I made with the regional tournaments in my area (Germany).

Not to mention you will have a learning curve for your deck and getting back into the format, which will cost you a lot of games in the beginning and lowering your winnings even more.

&amp;#x200B;

So my suggestion would still be to either find a deck you enjoy playing within a fixed budget, or start saving for a more expensive deck and starting with a budget variant of this exact deck.

But the value-driven plan sounds to me like a potential source of pressure and frustration. Please let me know if I understood your point correct, I do not want to imply anything that is not on your mind. Still hope this was of some help.",2021-06-23 20:01:26

MoistGochu,"I can give some information related to your questions.

Ignore the work-from-home increasing amount of miles driven.

Oil going to 100 dollars depends on OPEC and Asian demand in the near future.  Because oil demand is very inelastic, the crude price depends on the excess supply and demand.  Because long cycle investment in oil is dead, oil will structurally get a higher floor in terms of price due to the destruction of capex.  The structural oversupply from overproduction in Permian shale is all gone and the OECD crude inventory levels are about to head lower than 2015 levels.  Crude drawdown is accelerating and will continue to do so through the second half of this year.  This last week, we had a drawdown from the SPR to commercial inventory and still had over a 7 million barrel drawdown in crude.

Second very important fundamental is the backwardation curve on the WTI and Brent.  This curve has gotten extremely steep recently and will likely continue to stay this way.  With a curve like this, huge influx of oil capex will be discouraged.

A little more drilling is required if we want to prevent oil going above 100.  I'm already hearing from friends that Bakken and Athabasca is already seeing an uptick in oil production.  Don't be bearish though, this production won't make a dent in the rising oil demand which will likely rise by 3 mmb/d.  US will at max bring up just a little over 1 mmb/p in new supply.  New supply is also constrained by banks not wanting to finance new oil production due to ESG concerns.

As for current capex, exxon and other oil majors will continue drilling and investing in their offshore assets to maintain current production.",2021-06-24 10:03:06

wc49358,"As a major user of polygon I can argue this.

Pros:  
 I wanted to get into defi and this was the best place to learn.  Mistakes were not very costly.  Learn the ins and outs of approvals... etc

It had the best yields for a bit with the matic promotions.

It ""was"" fast until the bot congestion


Cons:
Polygon could suffer a 51% attack.  Matic prices were dropping and it was a small fear but it was a fear.  A whale could possibly buy up a very large portion and steal the billions of dollars on the network.

8 users have a multi sig for the entire network.  We know 4 of the 8 - founders of polygon.  1 is a curve founder,  I think 1 is aave founder.  (Don't quote me)  you need 5 out of the 8 to control the entire chain.  Possible kidnaps to force others into compliance ""could"" be a possibility.  I know its out there... but for a couple billion?   People have done worse for less.  

The last few weeks have been horrible to use.  Binance chain has been faster.   Yes the iron finance thing was horrible all 5 public rpc were a joke.  Even some private ones.   When it all came down to pulling out and removing liquidity it was near impossible.

Its not ""layer 2"" yet.  Its more of a side chain... layer 2 hasn't been implemented yet. (Honestly i rather them focused on more stable RPC for smother chain use)

Overall:

 I still use polygon heavily, I just understand the risks.  When btc started crashing and people were pulling out... I felt MUCH safer with my funds in the ethereum network than the polygon chain.  Its still growing and I will continue to use it.  More blue chip projects are coming on board which are all good signs.   More bridges , more adoptions... it's all good.  

Currently, fantom network has the best yields for stable coins so alot of liquidity jumped ship to that chain.  I feel safer on polygon than fantom.

wiegleyj,"Yep. Email the finance department. They will likely give you advice and not a permission numbers. The authority of the permission numbers typically rests with the instructor and not with the department office.

Further more most departments will wait until after registration to start dealing with permission numbers. During registration appointment periods needing a permission number is a sign you shouldn't have gotten into the class. It was filled up by students with a greater need than you (they were closer to graduation, this is why seniors get the earliest registration windows) or you didn't satisfy the prerequisites and you are supposed to be taking those instead. So, once registration is over it usually when we really start figuring out which permission number requests are valid and worth providing for.

badelectricity,"I think you might be hung up on the idea of cryptocurrency as ""currency,"" when that's not really what they are, or at least they aren't currencies like the USD or Euro are. It's consensus now that Bitcoin is a store of value asset, like a precious metal. Ether is a utility token without which you can't use the Ethereum network. Neither have grown to the point to having utility as an everyday medium of exchange and so people aren't using them as currencies. Sure there's some black market usage as currency, but that's only due to necessity, not because crypto is currently suited for it. Cryptocurrencies have various different monetary qualities paired with technological utilities and are pretty unique and novel compared to ""traditional"" investment asset classes.

The US dollar is generally a bad investment due to its monetary policy, inflation, and its status as the reserve currency of the world. Though it might be a pretty good investment if your nation's local currency is about to be hyperinflated. Bitcoin has a hard cap monetary policy which makes it finitely scarce, and Ethereum is about to implement token burns per transaction which could make it a deflationary asset. So they don't possess the same monetary qualities that make the USD a bad investment (also they aren't tied at the hip to the global oil market or backed by government guns) and are actually kind of the opposite.

As far as the real world ""value"" i think the tangible values of BTC and ETH are tied to (1) the physical resources (energy, computers) used to create the networks (and I think it's exciting that there isn't a central body that ""owns"" all of those computers), (2) the human power invested in its development, and (3) the network effects that incentivize expanded adoption. The price movement of these assets is wild, but user growth has consistently risen and continues to do so, even through the recent market collapse. 

I will say that I like lots of other crypto projects and own a few altcoins, but I don't think any of them other than BTC, and very recently ETH, have proven themselves beyond the point of being mainly speculative because none of them have achieved a real network effect, which I think is crucial to tangible value. That said, I think speculation exists on a curve and crypto is on the riskier end of the curve, while other investments are ""less risky"" (maybe, looking at you, ""everything bubble"") but still exist on the speculation curve because no one really knows the future, we just play probabilities, and the probabilities of BTC and ETH sticking around for at least the next decade seem to be growing. 

But you said it yourself that you believe digital currency is the future of human transaction, so why wouldn't you want exposure to the space? A non-zero allocation to Bitcoin is even being recommended by many legacy finance entities these days. It could even be argued (with math) that it's riskier to have no exposure to crypto moving forward.",2021-06-25 11:44:45
PlasticPegasus,"I guess the key considerations here are:

1. your appreciation of risk

2. the depreciation against any finance arrangement you may have.

On point 1, software issues are quite common on LR products (AFAIK) and so you should either take a look at third party options to solve (of which there are many), or factor the dealership cost of fixing (975AED diagnosis fee is absurd! - I bet they just unplugged the battery and back again). For example, there are myriad specialists who'll sell you a genuine, OEM battery for less than the dealer will charge.

Also bear in mind that as your car gets older, LRs have a reputation for being maintenance intensive. So you should factor in maintenance costs (tyres / battery / brakes / servicing etc) during the remainder of your planned tenure with the car. And calculate your total cost ownership accordingly.

On point 2, a key decision factor is whether you have negative equity on any finance. Certainly, the car will be easier to sell now with a good chunk of warranty left etc, but if you're still under water with it, then this might not be a wise time to get shot. Especially, as any replacement car will have the same initial heavy depreciation curve. If you're not owing any money on it, then the simple equation is whether your monthly cost of upkeep for basic maintenance and the cost of depreciation could be mitigated by getting into another car, versus the utility you enjoy from your range Rover.

TLDR: There are plenty third party options for software and basic maintenance items. 

If you're in negative equity on the car still, then keep it at least until the warranty runs out and reassess then.",2021-06-25 11:57:56

DarkBert900,"I'm subscribed to a bunch of news letters, including one from Mark Rubenstein. In his latest edition, which came out yesterday, he pointed out an interesting point about stocks:

&gt;It's hard to believe now, but equities were once a new asset class, at least in institutional eyes. A few years ago some finance professors conducted an appraisal of John Maynard Keynes’ performance as manager of his Cambridge college endowment from 1921 to 1946. Keynes’ top-down macro approach generated disappointing returns in the 1920s, but when he switched to stocks – not permitted by many other colleges until later – his performance improved. “Keynes’ great insight was to appreciate the previously overlooked attractions of a new asset class for long-term investors, namely equities.” 

It got me thinking how incredible the past two decades have been in our understanding of finance, including personal finance. We saw the decline in the appeal of bonds, savings and cash deposits because of a low interest rate environment, which seemingly came out of nowhere but now seems like it will stay forever. 

Why wouldn't the same thing happen to stocks? We already see Japan, a country ahead of Europe and the U.S. in numerous ways, including the central banking policy, ageing and a delayed recovery in the stock market, have the BoJ pump money into stocks/ETFs. It's not so far-fetched to think that the fate of bonds and savings cannot transition to stocks and subsequently will deteriorate forward looking returns to the point where (ordinary) people have to move up the risk curve once again for their savings. 

Perhaps subordinated stocks, junior equity or certificates, perhaps other assets for a sense of compounding interest. We take so many topics and principles for granted in personal finance, while most haven't been around long enough for us to fully develop a coherent framework around their stability or dynamics.",2021-06-26 16:17:14

Rtb3422,"Private Equity. This term is fairly loose tho, as many firms in the alternative asset management space have both hedge fund and PE capability. Perfect example is Elliott Mgmt. These are fairly generic terms to describe large asset managers that are not attached to investment banks, typically harboring institutional or family office money, have less then 100 LPs and invest in companies. I used to cover these firms when in worked in finance.

Easiest way to equate: Private equity invests money into non-public companies in the hope ~5-7 years (J-curve) turning the company into a profit for them, then exiting (selling).

Hedge funds: investing that same money but into public companies, with likely much shorter term time horizons (30 days - 1 yr). They’re are many flavors of these funds, market neutral, global macros, distressed, activist (also PE), quant, relative value.

Then all serve a different purpose, but the main ones are to diversify (with higher returns, and therefore risk) large institutional capital bases (like the FDNY pension fund).

They are the Buyside as they take positions in these companies, as where I worked (MM investment firm) was sellside as we work for these and Corp clients and provide services (not capital we are investing ourselves) but rather their capital and advise it.

somewhere_somehow1,"Purchasing a house is certainly an investment, but it's also not as simple as ""renting = bad, buying = good"". It depends on your long term goals and how intentional you are about either strategy. Intentional renting can be seen kind of like insurance, you have a fixed cost for living expenses and aren't on the hook for 15-30 years of a mortgage. You won't have unexpected costs (fixing plumbing, repairing the roof, purchasing new appliances when old ones break, etc...) and you have more flexibility to change your living situation if/when life throws you a curve ball.

It does come down to the ""personal"" aspect of personal finance. Other options to spend the $ you put into a down payment could have been to have a bigger emergency fund, Roth IRA, a mutual fund, and/or start your own business or a side hustle to increase income, etc... I'm not saying any of these are better or worse, it depends on who you are. I will say that there seems to be a common cultural belief that the best thing you can do with your money is buy a house.

bigbob888,"Agree. Don't see ETH 2 as an issue for Polygon or other L2's. Polygon is the first network which makes amazing dapps like 1inch, Sushi, Aave, Curve etc really shine. It's super fastt and cheap and while it's hit some issues (like the Iron Finance meltdown making it very hard to execute an order at all)  it is still impressive and will likely get better. Arbitrum etc are launching soon and those are technically more secure, but they won't be as cheap at Polygon either. So I think Polygon has a first mover advantage which is theirs to lose. The big holdout is Uniswap. I'm curious to see if they integrate with Polygon. The liquidity they offer is substantial and that could tip the balance to whichever L2' they support.",2021-06-28 04:23:43

Lewis_ABD,"I’m sure they could throw some more finance in, but short of becoming a professional team it’s difficult to say where that finance can go - other than into coaches to help get the best out of local youngsters. 

Because ultimately it’s going to be pretty difficult convincing a player from Glasgow or Edinburgh to turn their whole life upside down in order to move up here to either not get payed at all or only get paid enough for it to be a nice wee side earner (I’m not sure the situation). 

I suppose they could make it worth their while for current players to stay. Plenty talented younger players who could just throw the club a curve ball by going “actually I’m away to Glasgow for Uni”",2021-06-28 16:11:12
swashbuickler,"Reminds me of the arrogance and self-confidence swagger of the Ghostbusters: “I ain’t afraid of no ghost”
In this case: 
Ain’t afraid of regulators cause who can stop this: even countries which ban Facebook or shut off the internet can still get online via VPN. And that’s Facebook, a ‘mundane’ platform; where crypto offers another way on personal finance 

Also: note to the OP: 66 million may be e population: but there’s a good proportion of u-18 in there
And an ever growing cohort of 65+ folks. 
I want to be clear: you’re looking at low % adoption from each of those crowds which eats into that 66 MM

However: even if you say 40 million, for easy maths and accounting for demographic impact on adoption, and each of those puts $100 into crypto ( being mindful that considering a bell curve: there will be some small tail of adopters putting significantly more than $100 in. ) this brings an additional $4B to the market!",2021-06-28 21:32:15

MrMhmToasty,"If he enjoys these classes and thinks it's a good use of his free time, go for it! I would especially recommend taking some proof-based classes, since almost all Caltech math classes are proof-based and trip up a lot of freshmen who have never been exposed to the style of thinking.

However, it's ultimately not necessary. I completed my HS's math curriculum, culminating in AP Calc B/C and AP Stats my senior year. Got a 5 in Calc and a 4 in Stats. The SAT II Subject test in Math is important, with the average at Caltech being an 800 I think, so that's a pretty important one to nail (although one of my classmates got a 730 or so and still got in). I would say the average person at tech goes through something like this, so your son is ahead of the curve!

Ultimately the most important thing is that your son displays a real love for whatever field he intends to go into. Caltech can be really brutal and, if you're not committed to your major, it can be easy to lose motivation and interest in it (lots of people end up switching to something like finance or computer science). Taking college-level classes is a great strategy for showing this commitment, but so is something like setting up a tutoring program at his HS/in your local area. 

Best of luck with the rest of HS and the application process!!",2021-06-29 07:08:31
