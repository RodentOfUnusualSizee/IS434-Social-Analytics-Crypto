Elisa_LaViudaNegra,"I really enjoy I Will Teach You To Be Rich by Ramit Sethi. Great book that teaches young folks the basics of personal finance not according to The Rules (whatever those are), but according to what YOU value in life so that once your bases are covered, you can spend guilt-free on the things you truly love.

I also use You Need A Budget for budgeting. It truly changed my financial life. I know it’s a yearly cost but I pay it gladly because the value of knowing exactly what my money is doing is priceless to me, after having crawled out of a ton of debt. There’s a bit of a learning curve, but there are a ton of resources out there to learn, both supplied by YNAB and by Youtubers like Nick True. You can also google to find a free 3-month trial so you can get the hang of it before paying.",2021-01-01 01:37:04
maurymarkowitz,"&gt;The problem of fission is not deployment time. Look at China.

Ok, lets.

China currently has 49 reactors on the grid with a total capacity around 47 GWe. Their first such example, a small-scale system, was connected to the grid in 1991, so this buildout took place over a period of about 30 years.

In contrast, the USA has 94 reactors with a total of 97 GWe. The vast majority of those were connected to the grid between 1968 and the early 1980s. The US built twice as much capacity in about half the time of China.

France, a country of 67 million, has a fleet of 56 reactors for 61 GWe mostly built in the 20 years between the late 1970s and early 1990s.

So, China is well behind the install curve compared to other large buildouts.

China currently has another 15 reactors under construction for a total of 15 GWe, which will come online over the next 10 years.

In contrast, China installed 44 GWe of PV in 2018 alone, and another 30 last year. The last four years have installed more renewables capacity than their current 50-year nuclear plan.

PV and wind are trivially easy to finance and install. That is why they are being installed and nuclear is not. As you say:

&gt;No one want to invest their money in a plant that could be stalled for years because of licensing issues.

Although, it should be noted, licensing has little to do with it. As the recent MIT report demonstrates, most of the problem is in construction and planning. Perhaps things will change when the condo boom slows down and you can actually hire trades again.",2021-01-01 03:30:50
ScutumWall,"&gt;考虑投资回报效率 

经济学里efficiency所考虑的东西比return广多了，只考虑return的是finance。 

&gt; 这里讲的是技术封锁的行业...谈市场竞争没有意义...就是说只需要考虑走那一条路快慢走到的分别， 做出来之后自然会保证整个国内的市场

You do realize所谓的“做得出来”本身就是一个效率问题？这个信息时代要“做”什么东西的门槛比一两百年前低多了，MIT满实验室都是液体金属电池，清北中科院实验室里也不缺光刻机，非要强行说ends justify the means，只要你能接受成品率低，稳定性不足等低效率问题把laboratory bench变成production bench，要“占领”哪个行业完全就是资本问题，说到底100Gwh的液体金属电池和100Gwh锂电池都是100Gwh。

&gt; 换句话说 efficiency这个词在geopolitic前面根本不重要

当然重要。所谓的infant industry+embargo问题归根结底也就是你的AC太高supply线太左在国际市场毫无竞争力从而导致自己国内市场的supply side能轻易被国际monopoly控制而造成市场混乱。任何东西都有自己对应的utility curve，geopolitics、行为经济学里的各种bias、efficiency等是影响其坡度的exogenous variables，而效率在很多情况是主导因素。这世界上如果任何一个政权/群体/国家能做到无视efficiency，人类早就家家一台CCS设备，对人类未来影响最大的climate change也就小事一桩。",2021-01-01 08:33:14
yungmemlord,"MMT is a failure. In fact, MMT is simply a repurposed package of ideas, mainly taken from the doctrine of Functional Finance (“MMT seems to be pretty much the same thing as Abba Lerner's ""functional finance"" doctrine from 1943” - Paul Krugman) which failed in the 1970s. It argues that “slack,” the amount of resources not being used at a given time, is what determines inflation. This is partly based on an economic model called the Phillips Curve, which argued there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment (more of one will lead to less of the other). However, simultaneously high inflation and unemployment in the 1970s showed that this model was flawed. Rather, it is monetary policy, not slack, that determines the path of inflation. As economist Milton Friedman once said, “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon”. Not fiscal, monetary.

MMT also argues that fiscal policy is more important than monetary policy in determining inflation, so raising taxes is the solution to high inflation. However, this is not the experience of the United States. In the late 1960s, President Lyndon Johnson followed this logic by raising taxes and balancing the budget, but high inflation persisted. In fact, inflation only fell in the early 1980s when Fed Chair Paul Volcker reduced the growth of the money supply, despite high budget deficits under President Reagan during the same period. 

Lastly MMT contains too few safeguards against the risks of excessive public debt. Debt that might look manageable in one economic environment may become unsustainable in another, as Greece learned during the Great Recession. While the United States is unlikely to default on its debt, high debt can cause other problems, including either higher taxation or higher inflation in the future. Either of these problems can stifle future growth and prosperity. Furthermore, while the US is not in danger of becoming like Greece in the near future, history tells us that circumstances change. If the US continues to accumulate massive amounts of debt, there is no guarantee we will always be able to easily pay it off.",2021-01-01 09:58:27
tiltedsquares,"Yeah of course, so I'm ultimately an implementations consultant for a software company in the bay area, however, I specialize on the finance products. Hence a Financials Tech Consultant. 

It's a rly fun job since I technically work for a tech firm NOT a consulting firm- so I get the perks for a tech firm without necessarily all the stress and corporateness of a consulting firm. The learning curve can be steep bc youre learning the software, the industry, as well as your corporate customers processes. For example... escheatments. You'll learn how the software handles escheated checks, how the industry typically handles them, and then see how your customer handles them. Based on that, you'll need to combine all three together in the final product that you'd advise your customer on. Its not very tech heavy, as in you can learn all the tech on the job, as much as it is just learning finance as an industry. 

In the last couple years, I've been exposed to so much including the industries of my customers, my own tech software, and the inner workings of these corporations. I've enjoyed it and it's challenges. Hope this helps! Feel free to dm if you want to learn more!",2021-01-02 12:39:05
tveiga91,"Well, i understand that, trust me. But i think that even newbies have to learn the hard way sometimes when the easy way doesn't work.

When I entered this ""world"" of crypto back at the begin of last year (2020) i did know nothing about ETH or XRP, hell I didn't even knew there was 6000 coins! Of course I new it was extremely volatile so I did my research, i studied bitcoin, began to use ethereum, learning what was ERC-20, then NFT, then eventually I started to discover new projects, like CDC, Theta, Cardano, Tezos, Doge, XRP also (i did buy some, but i never saw what real pb they did solve, so i basically dumped my 20$ bag at the time and never looked back).

I think that crypto has a learning curve that everybody will take, even if they don't want to. Some will take the safe way, other the dangerous way. Even if the two are dangerous as f... I think that if people want to go blind and buy XRP, then let them. Maybe it's a necessary evil so they can open their eyes. Crypto is not for the average joe, but it's not unaccessible also, if people are willing to do the bare minimum, wich most don't. That's why we see so much whining about scams, ""hacked"" wallets (wich never are, it's just plain ignorance, but then again necessary as a lesson) and so on. I did fell for the famous elon giveaway, took my lessons and continued to stack bitcoin without whining, because I knew I was the sole responsible.

My opinion is to just let them be, they will learn the lesson and there will be two outcomes from that. Either they change their posture about this game, and start to play it by the rules and become millionaires, or they go crawling back to their mommy's crying that it's the crypto fault for ""robbing"" their money. Either way, I'm fine with that.

All projects I hold, i did my own research. From the beginning, without even having experience from the stock market. A complete noob. I studied about finance last year. I read books, studied white papers, took some classes online about TA and FA. I followed trusted reviewers at youtube. And i consolidated my portfolio to 5 projects for now and that's enough for the time being. My point is that there's is two type of noobs, the likes like me and the other ones who want to go the hardway. I'm no better than anyone, nor I think myself to be that way, but i really think that each one of us has their learning pattern and we should not mess with that. Even if we have good intentions. 😊",2021-01-02 22:19:29

luketran95,"There's no advantage of having more credits than your peers. If you have done more courseworks than your freshmen fellows, and on par with sophomore, then what? You get ahead of the curve by having more time to prepare (in terms of networking, technicals, and behaviorial), not by having less time. 

If your undergrad program last 4 years, then stick to its schedule. If you think workload is kinda vanila and you want to take on more courses to expedite your degree completion, here's the advice: Don't. Use the time to expand your network, prep for technicals, join case competitions, do mock interviews.

By the look of your resume, you already have basic knowledge of modelling, that's a good start. You know the game early on, good, don't waste your potential. Now shift your focus on hunting relevant internships for the summer. 

Here's my suggestion if you're following IBD, other high-finance professions might deviate from this.

**Stick to 4 year schedule**

\- Freshmen Summer: Boutique IB, Search fund, Small PE shop, etc.. And countinue to network relentlessly.

\- Sophomore Summer: Try punching for BB/EB/MM IB. If it works, great for you. Going through a summer at a big bank will give you a sense what IB is really like, and if it's not for you, you can use the experience to leverage your profile to get something else next summer. 

\- Junior Summer: If you still like IB and didn't land a BB/EB/MM IB gig in sophomore, give it another shot. If you landed a good gig, you could aim for a better firm. (i.e.: You interned in UBS last year, and this year you interview for Evercore/Goldman). 

\- Senior year: If it didn't work out for you in sophomore &amp; junior summers, you can still try full-time recruiting this year.",2021-01-02 23:32:44
dnautatrades,"Taken straight from my comment in my discord....

@everyone I've done A LOT of reading and watching to learn what I know now regarding the stock market or trading options. Some of it was due to experience, but for the most part I learned a lot because I made the effort to learn. I wanted to get better at making money. I wanted to know what to do and what not to do in different scenarios. I didn't want to rely on guessing or following complete strangers blindly. I wanted to be better than the average ""Robinhood trader"".

Some people don't want to learn and just want to make money. I completely understand if that sounds like you. Trading is hard work and it's more a lifestyle rather than a hobby. Keeping up with news, watching stocks, paying attention to your positions, gauging how the market is moving, etc etc. It's crazy! Not to mention it's a never ending learning curve/journey! Just when you think you've learned something or perfected a strategy, someone else comes along with more knowledge and experience than you, that can do it much better and easier.

Some people don't have time for all that. However, for those of you in here that want to learn or improve so you don't need anyone else, I've included some youtube channels, websites, and sources that have helped me learn.

ConceptualisticJury,"Unfortunately, I think it’s due to the economic barriers of investing in precious metals and a lack of financial knowledge in these communities. 

Precious metals is a good hedge against inflation, but I would recommend an investor put money in stocks or bonds, 401k’s, and IRAs before investing in precious metals. Many low income minority communities in the US either don’t have the money or the financial literacy to know or utilize the benefits of these programs. 

I think more finance and budgeting classes in middle school and high school would be a good start. My Hispanic friends who are first-generation college graduates are all learning about inflation and investing on their own and it’s a steep learning curve.",2021-01-03 03:27:48

pickmetoo,"Technical vs. Artsy depends entirely on your job and career path but in general, it will be more technical. Even as a 'design' architect who works primarily on schematic design phase international projects, the technical side of it is always at the back of my mind. In architecture, unlike art, nothing you draw is worth anything if it can't be built. I haven't touched an enclosure detail in 2 years but you better believe that the technical feasibility is in mind when I draw anything. 

On the complete opposite side of the industry, there are architects who do nothing but figure out how to put buildings together and draw details for 40 years. Keep in mind, *Architect* is a singular job title that encompasses a wide range of career paths. Some licensed architects have never worked on actual build work and regularly pull all-nighters for pennies on the hour while others have done nothing but site-adaptations for Chick-fil-a or raised-wall warehouses and get rich doing it. 

And one thing to note - when architects refer to something as ""technical"", it's not necessarily in the sense of math and science. Technical in this context generally refers to construction drawings. If you've never looked at a set of commercial construction documents I would recommend doing so otherwise you might not have a clue what I'm talking about. But in general, design phase work is more creative but a fraction of the work done at the average architecture office. The majority of work being done is detail drawings which are enlarged drawings showing how parts of the building actually go together. Think waterproofing, thermal insulation, wall structure etc. 

Regardless of how your career path progresses and what you're interested in, the first few years out of school will be fairly tedious full of long days annotating plans, picking up markups on detail drawings, working on roof plans etc. All boring shit. Beyond that, it's like any other career - it is what you make of it. If anyone tells you architecture is a horrible career, take it with a grain of salt. Likewise, if anyone tells you it's the best job of the world understand that they're one of the rare people who actually love what they do for a living. Do I love it? No, I love good wine, a charcuterie board and great company. Do I enjoy it? Sometimes - enough so that I don't dread most Monday's and don't mind working late every once in a while. Can I tolerate it in order to live a comfortable life and occasionally get the opportunity to do some really cool shit? Absolutely. I can't tell you that you should 100% be an architect but I can tell you that it's not near as dark and miserable as a lot of the people on the internet may lead you to believe.

At the end of the day, architecture is a job. Just like law, medicine, engineering, retail, corporate finance, etc. Literally, they pay you and to show up to work 40-some-odd weeks of the year and you do your work and go on with your life. Don't fall into any illusions that it has to be some sacrificial lifestyle and you're already ahead of the curve. The most miserable people I've ever met in my life are architects who fell into the illusion that *architecture isn't a career - it's a lifestyle*. Guess what happens when you put all of your happiness into what you do for a living - it's not good. I don't care if you're the top neurosurgeon, architect or hedge-fund manager in the world. You will more than likely be miserable if you don't have a fulfilling life outside of the office.",2021-01-03 14:55:10
BaronGoh,"My girlfriend studied economics and also mathematics so this is not exactly my experience. However, from what I understand, the econ major isn't very rigorous and you'd likely be better off in the finance major or at least QAMO. The standards for grading sounded like they were closer to the humanities compared to STEM (grading sometimes determined more on perception of effort / willing to give curve or bump grades) and I heard her have issues w/ nearly every group project (i.e. people wouldn't put in effort until the last day before project consistently among other things). Also, the department in general as the other commenter mentioned seemed more theoretical. Most of the applied research relating to the financial markets and such were in the business school whereas econ was in the social science department. However, there seemed to be some interesting topics like behavioral economics and international trade policies happening if those things are more interesting to you.",2021-01-03 16:17:31
BagofBabbish,"Usually de-risking means reducing volatility. In finance there is a principle that states there is a curve illustrating the maximum possible expected return for any given level of risk.

You can measure risk by volatility, ie how bumpy is the ride up. If cash is farther right and lowest on the curve, then crypto is far left but higher on the curve.

You need to ask yourself if you’re comfortable losing the money. If the answer is yes, then you need to ask if you think Bitcoin is better than moving stocks (ie the S&amp;P 500 always comes back so if you invest monthly, over the long run you’ll be fine, do you feel the same about Bitcoin?). If the answer is yes, then consider leaving it. If the answer is no, then move it into something else.

Again, these are questions you have to answer yourself, but that’s how I’d approach it personally.",2021-01-03 23:39:58

semiconodon,"Okay this is honest, level-headed analysis. It’s about money, and real-world restraints in a world where jerks write bots. 

But as for the money, there are such things s as diminishing returns. In government finance, there’s talk of a Laffer Curve, where eventually ever higher and higher tax rates don’t get us to more government revenue. Do these get-rich schemes by IG (such as reaping cash by getting us to pay for exposure)  _really_ bring in more revenue, or do they just tick us off? And with these schemes do we end up with a soft version of the garbage you described above: instead of honest ads, we get the cruft of paid-for exposure.

restinstress,"Quick procedural question: is Handron teaching Differential Equations in the spring? I thought he only teaches it in the Fall, given that 1) I just took it with him this fall and 2) I’m taking Intro to Math Finance with him in the spring. If you mean “Fall 2021”, ignore this. 

DiffEq with Handron was a lot of fun, but sufficient work. The homeworks are reasonably challenging, but mostly harder than anything you’ll see on exams, the weekly quizzes are an easy way to boost your grade, and the online assignments are mostly trivial. He has a really lenient grading curve, where the cutoff for an A could be something like an 85%, so you don’t need to be that stressed about your grades either. I found the class to be moderately challenging, but I don’t think I hit the 9 hrs/week expectation of the course, even with attending all lectures and recitations. Reach out if you have any more specific questions, or if you need help throughout the semester. Good luck!",2021-01-04 09:37:13
Bankcliffpushoff,"10% of entire capital exposure in cash terms or total net wealth terms - this is NOT ‘house value’. This is ‘house value minus finance’.

The key is to stick to one metric, not change it every time you want to curve fit. 

I argue that liquid assets should be seen as their own investment (gold, stocks, rare items with liquidity e.g. Rolex, a car which is 1-2 years old etc.) 

*car is arguable 

So 
Make a list of liquid net assets. 
Make a list of illiquid net assets.

Look at debts specifically too and their deadlines.
E.g. a mate wanted to risk putting a LOT of money into a stock but owed credit card debt which ‘he thought he’d pay back within 30 days but somehow he always misses the deadline by a few weeks’ or so.

So it’s more about sticking to a strategy, than about which is best (out of the couple of examples I’ve outlined, in general - I’m sure there’s better metrics we can add to the mix. E.g. ‘is the stock likely to be removed from the ASX200 list soon, is it a risky sector, is it volatile, does it pay dividends, and can you invest in that stock in another way in an unusual but strategic way 

E.g. I saw interest rates going down, and the charts showed me a likely ‘cut’ in rates, alongside a very improved ‘covid’ situation in Australia (where I’m from), so I did some research, Google Trends analytics and some keyword searching = bought a couple of domain names in the ‘sector’ of finance. 

Loan__.com.au - don’t wanna put the full domain here in case the new owner doesn’t want that but, sold for $20,000 (AUD) 4 months after I purchased it for $10.50.

This is just one way. (Yes it is repeatable but that’s another post I’ll make later somewhere since off track a tiny bit)

Another way is to (in your case) add pilot positions.
Then as the stock goes up, add to it.

It sounds counterintuitive but I assure you the best traders, today and in the past (I mean fund managers, long term proven stars, not ‘3 months into trading’) will tell you the same.

Get into a stock with a ‘pilot position’ because once you’re in, your paying attention. 

Then set a ‘trailing’ stop loss. If you are a long term holder do NOT fall for the ‘nah I HODL’ idea. Sure, set the stop loss to like 20-25% drop, but do not wait till it is down 40-80% before you ‘exit’.

So before you decide on how much to allocate, understanding your ‘risk’ vs ‘actual risk’ and ‘actual actions’ vs ‘what you think you’ll do’ is more important.

A famous trader said once, (if you’re good follow) this ‘you can put most of your eggs in one basket, but then make sure you fkn watch that basket well’ (something like that).

For 90% of people this doesn’t work (it’s the mental gap between ‘knowing what to do’ vs ‘what you actually do when shit happens’).

Good old Tyson quote - ‘everyone has a plan till they get punched in the face’.

So more than ‘too much money’, focus on ‘too much risk’ or ‘too little experience’ etc. and try and answer these.

I hope I didn’t over confuse you. Pls don’t hate me if I did - I’ve been exactly where you are and taught many, for the love of it, and the ‘risk’ and money part gets kinda confused /twisted.

Risk management plan is more important.",2021-01-04 16:26:29

&gt;Looks like a solid project and it seems that the team has been able to assemble some of the big hitters in the defi space, which is promising for stETH (Lido's eth2.0 derivative) integration in the various defi protocols. I am not so happy about the economics and distribution of the corresponding LDO governance token, as only 36% are allocated to the DAO-controlled treasury. That being said, there is no need to hold the LDO token in order to stake.

&gt;Just a heads-up, there is chatter about a Badger-style targeted airdrop for early adopters. Still early days but might be worth interacting with the protocol in case there is a successful governance vote.

The airdrop is currently being voted on

It looks like this first airdrop really only rewards stakers who have taken on additional risk by depositing ETH early on. The cutoff block was around 10 days after genesis. There are however ideas discussed in the governance forum to have a second airdrop with a future cutoff block. So it might be worth interacting with the protocol even if you’re not currently on the list.",2021-01-05 16:56:57

At first I lived with my parents, then I joined a year-long volunteer program which turned into a disaster after I was basically fired for having Bipolar (even though I really didn’t have symptoms... it’s a long story but they basically just wanted a reason to fire me).

MachineTeaching,"&gt;When the government tries to cut the economic pie in more equal slices, the pie gets smaller.

I think that is a bit too simplistic. I think it's also in an intro textbook and, depending on the surrounding context, sensible. You just want to illustrate tradeoffs and I can see how in macro-101-world a basic example of ""if we would redistribute all income perfectly there's less incentive to work hard"" isn't too bad of an example.

Nevertheless, the criticism isn't any better. The argument is that countries with low inequality can be rich, too. That doesn't disprove the argument that a high level of *redistribution* would lead to lower GDP or whatever else.

&gt;it is noteworthy that Mankiw describes income redistribution as a process in which the incentives for “working hard” would be reduced. This implies that people with high incomes work harder than those with low incomes. 

Eh I don't really think that's a reasonable implication. I'm pretty sure Mankiw doesn't actually think this.

&gt;Government can sometimes improve market outcomes

&gt;Mankiw freely admits that the market process in itself is not capable of providing all citizens with sufficient food, proper clothing and adequate health care. But for him, this does not necessarily imply a demand for state intervention. Rather, this depends on “one’s political philosophy.”

&gt;A completely different understanding of the state can be found in the classic description of state functions by the public finance specialist Richard A. Musgrave (1959), which in my opinion is still relevant today. He systematically distinguishes between the distribution function, the allocation function and the stabilization function of the state. 

Yeah but clearly it's still a matter of opinion to *which degree* a state fulfills these functions?

I mean, what is ""adequate"" housing, does a homeless shelter fall under adequate housing? What is ""adequate"" health care? Does that constitute simply ensuring access to healthcare, or does that mean everybody has a health insurance plan that is affordable to them? 

&gt;Under Principle 5 (“Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off”), Mankiw describes how trade (and thus ultimately a market economy) affects families. He comes to the conclusion that families compete against each other in shopping because each family wants to buy the best product at the lowest price. Apart from the fact that this is a misrepresentation of the economic principle, it is also an inaccurate description of the reality in a market economy. 

Of course people don't actually compete over cereal at Walmart or whatever. That doesn't mean that doesn't happen when it's relevant. Again, we're talking about an intro textbook making basic points.

&gt;Society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment”

&gt;Mankiw presents the relationship between inflation and unemployment as “Principle 10”. According to this principle, there is always a trade-off between inflation and unemployment in the short run. While Mankiw admits that some economists still question this relationship, he pretends that it is accepted by most economists.

Yeah, and I don't think it actually is? The Phillips curve is still valid, it's just more complicated in reality. Which is fine because this is still an intro textbook.

Also, see:

https://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2008/march/phillips-curve-inflation/

Of course you could argue that this section should be expanded somewhat. 

&gt;Minimum Wage Causes Unemployment

I do agree that you could expand on how that actually works in reality. I also understand that if you use the minimum wage as a basic example for a price floor, you might not want to get into monopsony power and all those things. 

&gt;Deflation leads the economy out of recession 

Okay, so the complaint seems to be that Mankiw ignores the ZLB? Again, you can argue how extensive you do or don't make an intro textbook. It's quite obvious that this is a factor that is indeed simply ignored. But again, it's a super basic model for an intro textbook.

&gt;Public debt reduces economic growth

I think that's the relevant part:

&gt;But even in the classical model framework, the result derived by Mankiw is anything but compelling. Rather, it arises from the implicit assumption that the government uses the funds it borrows exclusively for consumption. Moreover, it is characterized by the curious assumption that additional government demand for credit does not increase aggregate demand for credit, but reduces the supply of credit funds resulting from household saving. 

Which yes could be made clearer. Don't know if that happens elsewhere in the text or not.

&gt;Banks collect deposits, then lend them out as loans

Oh yeah that's actually one thing I agree on. I don't think the argument that this is an intro textbook holds here. While the other models are often basic versions of reality (although at times basic to the point of being wrong, which is fine as long as you're aware of that), I don't really like this approach. 

&gt;The perfect confusion in the small open economy

I actually recall this being confusing as well (I also used mankiws textbook as a student) so I agree here.

I agree with the last point as well.

All in all, a lot of nitpicks and some valid complaints. If that's the worst he can find, it's really not that bad tbh",2021-01-06 19:12:59
AxeLond,"I think those a good points and points out the hardest assumptions of that analysis.

The 37.6 PE made sense because that's the average for big companies today and if you assume that in 2030 Tesla will have similar growth plans for 2040. In reality assuming Tesla meets their forecast it would make Tesla the most profitable company in the world at 3x the second most profitable company, which ironically is Saudi Aramco selling oil today. Tesla would already run the world, and probably Mars as well.

Taking a look at some public massive companies and ignoring corona you have, Walmart going between 12-21, Royal Dutch Shell historically trading mostly 10-15 P/E. Volkswagen mostly 3-6 P/E, Apple 10-20 P/E. Going with fair P/E of 15 for a massive company you get a $1,740 price target.

The cost of equity I can't really say too much on, I'm more in engineering than finance, but it sounds like that's where they get you. You do your full analysis and as the final step you get ""Okay, what do you want the price target to be?"" and the excel spreadsheet calculates the cost of equity. Roughly 10% has been the average market rate over the past 80 years. The entire purpose of this was just to take Tesla at face value. We assume they're gonna meet their forecast. There is no risk because we assume that they will just do it, as a basis.

For the battery margin, I actually think it's possible to get it that high. In the really long term I don't think it's really sustainable to keep it that high, since it's still just a battery and kids in high school learn how to make those in chemistry class. However in the short term there will be insane inertia in the supply and demand curve of energy. Right now in the US enough energy can be produced profitably at $0.12/kWh to meet demand. 

If someone is operating a 40 year old nuclear plant with an average cost of $0.093/kWh and Tesla comes around and says, ""Hey, do you want to buy energy from our solar panels and batteries at a cost of $0.065/kWh?"" 

They'll say ""Great! I'll take 2GW worth of capacity."" for 12 hours of night that's 24GWh of batteries and 4-5GW of solar (around 2.5 mile square of solar panels). 24GWh is a bit less than Tesla's entire battery production today, but even at 3TWh it would only be enough to replace 125 nuclear reactors every year. There's currently 440 nuclear reactors operating in the world. To supply the entire world from batteries for 12 hours you would need 205 TWh of battery capacity. In 2030 Tesla will be able to supply 3TWh of that for $0.065/kWh, the rest of the world is still paying $0.141/kWh for electricity on average. What happens with the difference between $0.065/kWh and $0.141/kWh? That's your margin.

The 52% margins will stay until that 205 TWh demand of battery capacity is met. The average today is 160 g of Lithium per kWh of battery capacity. To do 205TWh you need 33 million metric tons of lithium metal.

Predictions are that by 2025 there will be [1.5 million tons](https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/articles/lithium-supply-is-set-to-triple-by-2025-will-it-be-enough) of Li2CO3 equivalent lithium production, which is 18.8% lithium by mass. So 300,000 tons lithium per year mined and 33 million tons of lithium metal needed to meet demand? Even if batteries can store and sell electricity at $0.065/kWh with solar, they'll be worth $0.141/kWh for a long ass time.",2021-01-07 01:44:22

WayOfTheMantisShrimp,"Long post incoming, three TLDRs at the bolded headings.  
This discussion comes up a lot, there are some fair points for each language. However, I feel like some R-advocates have a grudge about being told they are the underdog on their own turf, and the Python advocates have a large number of rather poor debaters among their ranks.

Background:  

- a couple years beyond a degree in statistics, with heavy focus on computational methods, and a couple years experience with data analyst work in finance. Not a professional programmer or SWE, I just do some programming
- started studying programming (OOP and functional) formally in 2007, have more than just passing experience with (in chronological order): Excel formulas, VBA, Java, Scheme, C, R, SQL, Python, Julia
- Was introduced to R in 2013, and it was instantly my favourite language (until I started playing with Julia about six months ago). Tried Python in 2014, and 2016, and dropped it because I didn't like it, then picked it back up in 2019 because now it's everywhere.

**About R:**  TLDR: R is great when you just want to get some analysis done

1. Nice for functional programming. I like that, meshes with the thinking of mathematics and Excel formulas. It counts starting at 1, like I've been doing since pre-school. Thinking in vectors and data frames was my default by the time I was introduced to R (a 'dictionary' is a data frame with a vector of keys, and a vector of values, I never cared about O(1) access in 95% of cases, it's still faster than a VLOOKUP)
2. R feels nice when you just have a question that needs to be answered by some data. There's no resistance to open a csv, check some summary statistics, plot a histogram or two on arbitrary variables, run a regularized regression, and make a simple plot. Faster than Excel I would say, especially with data.table and ggplot2, and this work flow is highly relevant to day-to-day analysis. RStudio complements this in every way, and there is some ergonomic value in having a default R IDE experience
3. R has generally high-quality implementations of a lot of the most common, and many uncommon statistical algorithms. R competes with Excel, Matlab, SPSS and the like, and I think is favoured for users that have the luxury of choice
4. I don't consider R a beginner-friendly language, I never recommend it as a first language to anyone but hardcore stats people; it has too many ways that it will let you screw yourself out of performance or consistent behaviour, and not much in the way of guard rails. It abstracts away a lot of the underlying machinery, which is great, but steepens the learning curve too. I still do recommend it to non-novice programmers looking for something suited to the work
5. I don't consider R as my go-to performant language if the entire task is at big-data scale. There are undoubtedly ways to make it work for 99% of users, R is not a deficient language, but they are not always ideal/elegant, and you start feeling that friction. The real answer is the C/C++/Fortran under the hood, which I feel is a compromise (ie learning to read those languages to check the nuts and bolts)
6. R is hard to 'share' with non-R-users; notebooks are great between analysts with R installed, but they aren't at the level of ""double-click to run"" packaged apps, or as ubiquitous as spreadsheets. Fair mention of RMarkdown to make html/pdf docs though, I think they are a key for professional use of R

**About Python:** TLDR: Python makes it easier for experienced programmers to work with the huge number of junior Python coders that are able to flood the market 

1. Python permits you to do functional programming. But object oriented programming is great in a team-project setting, or inter-team. It formalizes and highlights the interoperability of different pieces. The rigidity of linking behaviours to data helps (a little) to keep sloppy coders out of trouble (R lets you do anything to anything, and probably won't even throw a warning). OOP is not my favourite but Python does make it easier, especially compared to R. And like OP I didn't quite click with R's objects until I got into Julia structs.
2. Python is general purpose: any programmer can justify learning it, any teacher can justify teaching it. There is a library for anything you can imagine and more. It competes with Java, C++, LISP, Ruby, and a lot of others, and I think it is the most approachable as a jack of all trades, master of none. Having a language you can use for everything\* is valuable. Having a large user base to learn from is even more valuable, which is the positive feedback loop that blew up Python without a marketing budget.
3. Python is easy to teach beginners that have little to no programming background, *especially* if they have little other programming background. Everyone can grasp 'not', 'or', 'and' easier than !, ||, &amp;&amp;. I've watched several blank slates pick up the conventions faster than I would expect (they don't ask about where to put the data type, or the curly braces, or the semi-colon), and base Python is quite consistent with itself, making for a smooth but not slow learning curve.
4. Python enforces logical indentation, my favourite thing about the language. It is a guardrail for the barest basics of readability, which is a godsend for reading the code of others, including past-you and past-me. That sort of ergonomic style is what I would choose to make my co-workers and predecessors use if I could, especially the ones that didn't formally learn programming practices.
5. Base Python does not have vectors/arrays, matrices, or any native tabular data structure. It's not even trying to be a math/science/data analysis language. If people like to use it that way, they can, it's become rather easy. But those dependencies start eating away at the consistency that makes Python elegant. (For base R, it is basic string manipulation that needs supplementing)
6. Python is nice to read and write (important!), but it's not fast without knowing some tricks and having some libraries in low-level languages, just like R. It is often ""fast enough"", which should not be overlooked, but at big-data scales Python is really more of an API than an implementation. You're still going to learn C to see under the hood. I also haven't gotten good results from parallel computing methods.
7. For such a polished/established language, the lack of a 'standard issue' IDE was a friction point for me. Settled on VS Code and am mostly happy, but configuring the environment was not effortless for me like RStudio.

\**gets on soapbox*\*  
**About Julia** TLDR: has limitations, but does a lot of stuff really well, and it overlaps pretty well with the requirements of data analysis/science

1. It is a proper high-level language, it can be written a lot like Python (positive thing), though without the enforced indentation (each block having an explicit 'end' is a partial consolation). It supports functional and object-oriented language almost equally (and painlessly) in my opinion
2. It counts the first index as 1, as it should. Vectors, matrices, linear algebra, statistics/probability functions, mathematical operators and more are all efficiently implemented in the standard library (notably absent DataFrames.jl, but it fits in well enough). AND string manipulation is decent. It feels natural to use base Julia for simple tasks.
3. Performance is effortless. You can write for-loops and not suffer; heck you can write parallel for-loops by adding 9 characters and it will 'just work' and scale better than most 'vectorized' code in R/Python, which is part of the core library (race conditions may apply, it doesn't fix those for you). If you can make strong assumptions about types, then add those for a little bit more efficiency in memory use, but otherwise just write it generically and multiple dispatch will usually make it 'just work'. 'Vectorized' notation is also moderately efficient in the core language if you prefer it for readability, and can be applied to literally any/every function, and I'll say it again, it just works. List comprehensions have their place too, writes a lot like Python.
4. Julia competes with R and Python for high-level ease of data analysis and scientific computing, but also C++/Java for versatility and performance, and even C/Fortran for absolute efficient use of resources. It literally tries to do it all, solving the two-language problem, and it is an astoundingly good effort. You want to write a fast library for Julia? Write it in Julia, no other languages required in most cases. Even most of Julia is written in Julia.
5. Julia is not trying to take over the world's codebases on its own, overnight. It has inherent interoperability with Python, R, C++, C, Fortran, and Java so you can still recycle your existing code base at all points in time. I see that as making a smooth transition for those that want to.
6. The  custom Julia-centric IDE has ceased development, but the active community is largely unified behind VS Code as the 'standard' experience. Not as polished as RStudio, not much different from configuring Python in VS Code, but I found it satisfactory.
7. The community is small. Really active, enthusiastic (can you tell?), and making primarily high-quality contributions (no shortage of ML and scientific libraries), but it doesn't make up for Julia not having the massive resources (tutorials, libraries, StackOverflow questions answered) available for Python. And some don't care for the provided documentation, which is tough when alternatives are scarce.
8. Julia has a similar problem with being shared to non-Julia users, which is the majority of the world. Pluto.jl Notebooks are a start for reproducing between users, Markdown docs are a good step to non-programmers, and PackageCompiler.jl is working on it, but it's not robust yet. Possibly the only thing it can't replace is the ubiquity and gentle learning curve of Excel.",2021-01-07 11:09:43
supenguin,"I am switching from primarily using a Mac to Linux so that kind of limits my options a bit! I've still got my old Mac and still running stuff in parallel.

If you're comfortable rolling your own spreadsheet, I'd say do that since that gives you 100% control of how things work.

I've heard good things about SEE Finance.

Personally I ended up on Moneydance. I had used it before Banktivity and even before YNAB. They don't do subscriptions, you get whatever version comes after what you bought for free and then updates are only 1/2 price of the app (after which the next update is free). It's powerful, it's been around for a while, runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. There is a learning curve. And it's not the prettiest thing in the world, but who really cares about that when it comes to a personal finance app? Their trial is up to 100 transactions and I think that is just manually entered transactions so hopefully you could download the trial and give importing a shot.

Updating security prices has required a plugin. They have some other good plugins including one that forecasts future account balances based on past transactions rather than scheduled transactions.

The only other possible downside you bring up is support - the Moneydance support is through [tenderapp.com](https://tenderapp.com) which feels more like forums than a support ticket system. They do tend to respond within a day or two.",2021-01-07 11:53:24

My cousin is a finance manager at a major dealership. The mmr for the stang on both trims drops like a rock. Mathematically speaking.

Spottedcowz,"Man, you are just on about this minimum wage thing, aren't you?

You assume hypocrisy because you have a very shallow and superficial understanding of finance.  Raising the minimum wage as a way of combating poverty is not particularly effective.  The absolute value of money paid to a person is irrelevant. What matters is the amount of money they have in relationship to everyone else.  If I have a dollar, here in real world 2021, that's not much money.  But in analogy land where the entire country only has $100 total, well, then I'm incredibly wealthy.

So if we raised the minimum wage AND prices didn't change, it would be effective.  That's an unrealistic and naive belief, however.  Cost of labor goes up, prices will rise to follow.  It does change the ratio a little bit, but it mostly flattens the curve between poor, middle class and upper middle class - it doesn't affect the wealthy at all.

An example would be if the government sent everyone a check for a million dollars tomorrow. That wouldn't result in everyone being rich, it would just result in some really nasty inflation.  It WOULD more or less eliminate any financial difference between someone making 18k/yr and someone making 50k/yr. And it would be a significant hit to someone with a million dollars, who would see the value of their extant million drop precipitously, but it wouldn't even be a noticeable hit to a billionaire. Meanwhile, our 18k/yr. shlub isn't materially better off - prices will have risen enough that they'll still just be getting by.

Money doesn't have any intrinsic value.  It's just a lubricant for trade.  The value is in the goods and services you can trade it for.  Printing more money doesn't make more goods and services available.

And you can do localized minimum wage increases without affecting the country too much.  Seattle raising their minimum wage doesn't have a huge impact on national inflation, because they represent a fairly small portion if the economy.  Doing it nationwide? You'd see a noticeable increase in the price of nearly everything.  At the end of the day, for every person getting more than their fair share, someone else is getting less.  Not just on a nationwide scale, but on a worldwide one.  The standard of living in the US is propped up by exploitation of developing nations.  The rich here are just doing the same on an intranational scale as well, and that is the problem with income inequality.  Lifting the poor up by bringing the middle class down is not a good solution - it doesn't make big enough changes for the poor and it doesn't address the issue that so much of our wealth has accumulated at the very top.

But you believe that the other ""side"" is just hypocritical and mean because you don't have a good grasp of the nuance of the policies they espouse.  And I'm not mad at you about it, that's an issue common to virtually everyone that identifies as left or right.  And the few partisan people who do actually understand the likely knock-on effects of these platforms are just using their knowledge to manipulate the bumper sticker and 144 character ideologies of the masses for their own enrichment.",2021-01-08 06:54:41

San Diego was built in large part the way it is because of the geographic features of up 200 feet to the top of the canyon, down 200 feet to the base of the canyon, up 200 feet to the top of the canyon, down 200 feet to the bottom of the canyon, lather rinse repeat.   There have been TV documentaries of how the canyons promote species extinction because the area in the canyon is too small for a viable population and the top of the canyons where all the housing is is too formidable a barrier to species movement.   But I digress.

Tell ya what, when you can get them to eliminate height limits at Bay Park, build some high rises that can handle at least half a million people and put a trolley extension through downtown La Jolla, I promise I'll be attentive.  Oh, and teach all the million or so people to be good neighbors who understand that living cheek by jowl is not a license to go hog wild (gee I'm getting poetic this evening), but an obligation to be polite.

2.1 billion dollars, all the earth moved, concrete poured, metal forged, electricity generated (seemingly forever) for the trolley, lives disrupted, and on and on for a measly 13,500 people trips a day. Let's assume a 30 year life for the trolley, electric cost is zero, no maintenance and that no loans were taken out to finance the project, we're talking 20 dollars a rider over that time period.

So let's spend tens times that amount, eminent domain things in the way (La Jolla Farms?  The Mormon Temple?) and hey johnny johnny we're up to 135,000 rides a day out of 22+ million.  Let's go for broke (perhaps literally), spend 3.4 Trillion with a T and we can get all 22+ million rides on mass transit!  And all on the shoulders of the middle class and poor while the money'd get their homes in La Jolla or Rancho Santa Fe and don't have to deal with all those hoi palloi mucking up their freeways.  Oh, and just another few billions for the skyscrapers.

Mass transit would be great ya know, except for the dang masses. (shudder).

WryLawTalkingGuy,"I think your pre-law school experience is going to be more important to your own personal professioal development than it will be to an employer. If you have experience in management, you'll be better at management when you're given that responsibility. If you have experience in finance, you'll be better at dealing with client financial  issues. Your future employers are unlikely to be very impressed with skills like these. They will expect you to get the job done regardless of your learning curve. And if they don't have these skills, they're not likely to value them.

I would highly recommend getting some real world professional experience before law school. It makes the coursework in law school more relevant, and it makes you overall more employable later because employers will assume you've got work basics down (show up on time, don't bitch about overtime, know when to keep your mouth shut, etc.).

Besides, you might get lucky and it will lead you to a career other than law :)

Best advice I could give you today is pour every spare dollar and every spare minute into LSAT prep. Even a couple points improvement can mean thousands (or tens of thousands) in student loans covered by scholarships rather than your future earnings.

ReichMarshallNimitz,"&gt; Yes, but the upper-bound in CS is high. Basically you are saying “the normal curve exists guys”. Like, ok...yeah I agree. And if you do something be at the top of the curve.
&gt; 
&gt; Posts like this irritate me because they have accurate data, but readers will think “oh CS pays like anything else, not worth the bother”. No. It pays well. If you want to be average that is fine, but if I want to do something I don’t shoot to be average at it. I don’t know anyone who does something and just wants to be plain break “ok”.

While you are right in that the curve for CS is much higher than something like accounting or education, the curve is not as high as majors like Finance or marketing. Top salesman and fund managers pull in millions per year, it's not even close. Some of the top finance guys make more money than should be ethically possible.

I would argue that the upper-bound in CS is not high, rather that the average is the high value. The average CS major will make more than the average marketing or finance major, but top marketing or finance majors will make more than top CS majors.

The ""closer"" you are to the money, the more money you tend to make. That's how all business' operate. People with further proximity to profit (like humanities majors) tend to make less, while engineers/CS tend to be in the middle, while management/finance will be the closest to the money and therefore make the most. However, because of limited spots at that top tier of finance/management, most (meaning the average) professional will not make those figures (despite the high upper-bound).",2021-01-08 17:40:11
docpurple5891,"Using this to have the best chance of reaching others.

After scraping through as many threads and forums as I could as well as talking with several other people, online, family, coworkers, etc., two of which are very experienced in money management and software, I have come to a solution. It's not as pretty as Simple was, but I might actually end up liking it better in the long run.

I have decided to use One Finance for my ""replacement"" to Simple. They have a couple features already in place that are good enough for me to feel comfortable as well as talk directly from them about adding many similar features or direct clones as Simple.

Then, to account for the budgeting aspect, I have decided to use YNAB (You Need A Budget). It will be different. It will be a learning curve. It will not be ""fun."" It will, however, stay with me no matter which bank(s) I use though and I shouldn't have this same issue again for future. I have direct sources who are long-time users of YNAB and they said they have had very little issues with their accounts syncing and that the developers stay on top of issues really well.

I will wait and see what PNC decides to do with their new acquisition as I've heard reports from current users that they've dropped a lot of functionality they previously had. This could be indication of plans to implement a lot of Simple's functionality, but I'm not personally waiting around to see how badly they screw everything up while also trying to be able to use and access my money and maintain a budget.",2021-01-09 03:23:12

MachineTeaching,"&gt;I'm reading Stephanie Kelton's 'The Deficit Myth,' and wondering why the US government issues securities at all

Because that is aside from taxes one of the primary ways how governments finance themselves. They are essentially very cheap but also very secure loans to the government.

&gt;since it can just print as much money as it wants

It can't, really. It's not like there is any sort of fixed limit, but you would eventually get inflation, and as you rely on money printing more and more, more inflation. That's how you get hyperinflation, which is an economic desaster.

And yes, the MMT counterargument to that is that you could raise taxes and take money out of the economy again, but that argument is in all honesty kinda dumb. If you print X amount of money and then take out X amount of money via taxes you haven't actually created any more money in practice.

&gt;Is it to control inflation?

In the real world, the central bank controls inflation via typical tools like OMOs and when necessary through unconventional monetary policy like QE.

MMT thinks monetary policy is useless and that the IS curve is vertical. [Which it isn't.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/b9ktk9/comment/ek8sd9q)

If what you see in the real world doesn't match up with MMT, that's not surprising because MMT is mostly wrong.",2021-01-09 19:33:09

ozozznozzy,"This is literally my favorite subject and I'm an actual studied mathematician (admittedly work in finance now).

Infinity is very complex. People hear it, and the idea of it is so big, that they immediately assume it means everything. That just isn't true. Another redditor used a base 2 number system to make the point, but I'll add this, there are infinite numbers between 1 and 2, and none of them are 3. There are an infinite number of prime numbers, but none of them are 21. 

If I drop a nail on the ground, there are an infinite number of ways it could be oriented. 

There are an infinite number of distances between any two stars.

All that being the case, there is an approaching 0 probability that a random cluster of dots on a paper resemble any pattern of stars in the sky from earth or any other universal angle. This probability gets closer to zero with each new dot. 

This was a huge debate when Rick and Morty came out as people were arguing about the infinite universes vs central finite curve. In reality it is unlikely, even with infinite universes, that any of them have a planet that resembles Earth, let alone a similar group of humans with a similar history.

VTDMAN7,"I think you should decide this based on your future goals imo. If you want to be an engineer or go into finance or be a math/applied math/stats major then probably pick BC but if you want to do other things then probably pick Stats. Doing a max of Calc AB is fine for engineering or math majors in high school but the problem in your case will be that you will have a years gap which can hurt your math skills. Stats is very useful and will help you in a lot of careers but is very different from the rest of math so you will have a big gap in your education. If sat you had taken AB in senior year then it would be fine because there would be no gap. Also first semester of BC will basically be AB and second semester senior year doesn’t really matter in terms of grades unless you really mess up. So think about your future goals and then decide. I used to be not weak but not strong either at math up till like 6th-7th grade but I still did the work an struggled and I’m very good at math now. There’s always a learning curve and once you get past that things become really easy or much more bearable at least. Just don’t approach your work with the attitude that you hate it. Try to actually enjoy it even fake enjoying it and you’ll start hating it less. Also wait for the rest of the year to finish to see how good/bad you’ll do at AB. You could take both BC and Stats well that’s what I’m doing this year as a senior. Also if you’re in online school, that may be a reason you’re hating calculus.

Romeo_Santos-,"This is bs.

I heard from a friend who did not know anyone in this class about it. Apparently he put in so much work and was getting 90's in the problem sets. He would have finished with an 80 but he got curved down to a 72.

Everyone at Rotman knows that certain profs (cough,cough... Michael Khan) use the final exam as a way to curve down students' marks and bring them down to the desired average.

This is such a lack of understanding for students and their grades; as if UofT was not hard enough. No wonder the mental health at UofT is awful.

My recommendation: if you want to do Finance, switch to Management with a focus in Finance so you avoid taking ECO300 level courses, as well as ECO209 (really tough course).  
Finance and Econ is not worth it. 

Also, do not take ECO339 or ECO364. Both are awfully hard and have low averages",2021-01-13 07:36:01
ronin_zulu," The way I see it you have 3 options. Thankfully, they are not mutually exclusive so you can work on a combination of these.

1. Get a higher paying job and slowly pay down the debt. I worked as an accountant for a while and although getting a CPA provides you with a better salary, you will have to work 1-2 years at a pretty average salary (50k-60k) and working long hours as you alluded to. Also, it requires an extra 2 years of study and a certification exam which you can't realistically complete while working full time. If you run back-of-the-envelope maths, with 100k salary (50k after taxes) and limited expenses (2k/month), you can pay $4k/month of debt which would take you about 4 years to pay down your debt. However, if you can only pay down $1k/month, it would take you 19 years...
2. Default on the loan. I am not sure this can be done while shielding your parents from any consequences but it's worth exploring. As someone else already mentioned, defaults are eventually dropped off your credit report but for such a large amount, Im inclined to think they will hunt you down forever and seize any assets you eventually purchase. I dont recommend that option.
3. Start a side hustle. This is what I did when I was in a similar situation (although my debt was much smaller) in my mid-twenties. I was also coming out of business school and did not want to wait decades to pay down my debt and achieve some financial flexibility. I started by tutoring accounting and finance on the side then made it a business and hired other tutors. There is definitely a learning curve in starting a side hustle or business but the risk is limited and the upside is significant. It is also much easier to make a side income online today than it was 10 years ago when I did it.

My recommendation is to keep/get a decent paying job, be frugal and aim to make some extra money online selling your services (tutoring, bookkeeping for local small businesses, etc.). Then you can expand and make it a business. If you can put $4k-5k per month to pay down your debt, you will be out of this mess within 4 years.

This is not an insurmountable debt and you can definitely solve this. However, I think it requires a bit of creativity and thinking outside the box if you dont want to work 70 hours/week for the next 20 years.",2021-01-13 09:20:24
dfj2025,"Watch the video from Hans.  It has a really good insight into the economy.

There was time when interest rates were 15%.   Whenever the economy started to slow down they would be lowered to get the economy going again.  It's just since 9/11 and the 2008 banking crisis interest rates have been so low they no longer matter.

The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate:
https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/what-economic-goals-does-federal-reserve-seek-to-achieve-through-monetary-policy.htm#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Reserve%20works%20to,moderate%20long%2Dterm%20interest%20rates.

There is NOTHING federal about the Federal Reserve. It's a corporation where board members are prominent members of the banking industry.   

I'm not a big fan of fiat currencies.  Inflation is a hidden tax making sure everyone is suffering with debts that can never really be paid off.  Here's a really good video on the evils of our monetary and banking system:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDlnM481Gcg
It's a little long but I've watched twice now.  If we are going to have a fiat currency then the Federal Reserve needs better tools for ensuring the dual mandate is achieved.  

The Federal Reserve doesn't call it UBI.  They call it ""helicopter money"": 
https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/082216/what-difference-between-helicopter-money-and-qe.asp#:~:text=Helicopter%20money%20involves%20the%20central,or%20scattered%20from%20a%20helicopter.
I think UBI would pay for itself in tax revenues and by making the dollar more valuable through people's greed to spend it.  The problem we have now is to much money is in too few hands.  I believe as money gets concentrated into fewer hands it becomes intrinsically worth less.  The more people in general having money the more overall greed there is for people to want to have more of it.  Say someone has UBI and income from a minimum wage job.  When people get into the habit of spending more money they will want more of it.  Right now what we have is people have so little what's the point of even trying when everything costs so much.  Check out this video:
https://tcf.org/content/commentary/video-wealth-inequality-in-the-u-s-is-worse-than-you-think/
It's funny how people try to discredit this video.  But the facts remain no matter how much people try to convey an opinion to the contrary.

If you want to learn more about laissez faire capitalism this is really good video you might want to watch:

The problem with the politicians is no matter how they try to spin it you can't dispute the facts.

I think UBI is the answer because it allows the Fed another tool to cause the economy to begin to accelerate.  The problem with the US and World economy is it's a BIG ship with a small rudder.

nailpolishlover12,"1. Yes, downpayment savings and emergency fund should be in a high yield savings. I use Ally. I like it. They’re all the same basically so you can use whoever you want. 

2. I would do retirement savings and paying off the loans at the same time. I’d be fine with you just doing the 5% into 401k (what you’re doing now) and save the Roth or non retirement investing for after the loans are paid off. Although if you can afford to put a little in a Roth I’d start that as early as possible. Early contributions are key here. I wouldn’t do any non retirement investing at all until after you are debt free. Contributing 15% personally to retirement and have the house. Those are all more important things than regular investing. 

3. Yes. I’d like for you to do both. Early retirement investing is key to major growth even if it’s just small amounts while you pay off the loans. 

The other poster is giving you the Dave Ramsey baby step approach. I’m a huge Dave Ramsey fan. Get his book the total money makeover and read it. He is the financial independence guru for dummies. His plan works, but his plan isn’t the only plan that works. Use his plan as a guide and modify for your needs. For example, he says a $1,000 emergency fund is enough and he has really good reasoning behind that, but I disagree that $1,000 is enough for most people for a Heath emergency or car emergency so personally I like 3 months of living expenses as a minimum. He also will tell you not to invest at all until you are completely debt free. This is good advice, but if you are smart about it I think you can find more success doing both.

DougFane,"Because that isn't actually socialism? The presence of a safety net is honestly largely irrelevant to me, but for what it's worth I personally support it. The real question at issue is how you generate the labor and capital required to produce those safely nets along with all the other things it takes to run a modern and competitive society, and the answer to that question has been shown time and time and time again to be access to free markets and clear incentives to innovate, work hard, and take risks.

At the end of the day, if what you want is a robust social safety net and an improved quality of life for the average laborer, there's really not much question that capitalist systems are the best way to finance that.

The only real limitation on a capitalist society's ability to create those nets is the Laffer curve and the political will to enact them, with the former being a mostly theoretical concern. In socialist states it is actually a very pressing problem. More importantly, literally every ""successful"" attempt at implementing socialism on a broad scale and for a long time has necessarily involved a strong central government and a command economy, both of which are so ripe for abuse that I can't think of a single example of a country that has lasted for more than a few generations that didn't collapse or become a complete dystopia.

I strongly suspect that what you actually want is to become more like a Nordic state, and they will be the first to tell you that they are not socialist. Calling it socialism is only going to make it less likely for the people who oppose you to get their way, because there are a lot of people who have a logical and understandable fear of that idea.",2021-01-14 17:30:47

# White House document reveals US plan to defend Taiwan

 

**‘BOLSTER ALLIES AND COUNTER CHINA’**

Mr O’Brien said it demonstrates America’s strategic commitments to not only the Indo-Pacific but its regional allies and partners, ensuring preservation and protection of their sovereignty.

“This confirms that US strategic policy in the Indo-Pacific was in substantial part informed and driven by allies and partners, especially Japan, Australia and India,” Professor Rory Medcalf, head of the Australian National University’s National Security College, [said in his analysis of the document for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/declassification-of-secret-document-reveals-real-us-strategy-in-the-indo-pacific/).

“Contrary to concerns that the Trump administration was veering to a one-dimensional, military-led external policy, there was a clear recognition of the need for holistic engagement to bolster allies and counter China, across the full spectrum from information operations to advanced technology research and infrastructure investment.

“Whether America has the capacity, co-ordination and will to follow through on such a total strategy is another question.”

One objective within the plan is to align with the strategies of Australia, India and Japan, creating a “quadrilateral security framework” and having the four nations as “principal hubs”.

The strategy also includes “accelerating India’s rise” and having a strong India as a “counterbalance to China”. It repeatedly refers to the “US Strategic Framework for Countering China’s Economic Aggression”.

Australia’s experience with China influenced the drafting of the US strategy.*Source:News Regional Media*

A senior US official told [*Axios*](https://www.axios.com/indo-pacific-strategy-trump-administration-china-377b965c-6cf8-4299-a230-c0e869bb4d73.html) “a lot of credit” has to be given to Australia and its experience with [China](https://www.news.com.au/topics/china), which influenced the drafting of the strategy.

“In many ways they were ahead of the curve in understanding influence operations and interference in domestic systems,” the official said.

Speaking after the release of the framework, former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the Australian Government had a “clear-eyed, realistic view of the tensions in the region” at the time, including the need to maintain and bolster alliances and “stand up against coercion”.

“We took a number of measures, [banning Chinese vendors and the 5G network](https://www.news.com.au/technology/gadgets/mobile-phones/huawei-banned-from-australian-5g-network/news-story/d1d6ec001747ba51e7c5c8738021f7ee), we did that in advance of the United States,” he told [*ABC News Breakfast*](https://twitter.com/BreakfastNews/status/1349105285575544838) on Wednesday.

“We obviously legislated to protect Australia from foreign interference.”

He described the document as a “thoughtful” statement of America’s strategic priorities in the Indo-Pacific.

But the problem is President Trump’s foreign policy has been “erratic and inconsistent”, Mr Turnbull added.

 

**‘MAJOR POWER MILITARY CONFRONTATION’**

In regards to China, the US framework includes devising and implementing a defence strategy capable of “denying China sustained air and sea dominance inside the first island chain in a conflict” and “defending the first island chain nations, including Taiwan”.

“Objective: Enable Taiwan to develop an effective asymmetric defence strategy and capabilities that will help ensure its security, freedom from coercion, resilience, and ability to engage China on its own terms,” it states.

The “First Island Chain” [covers the South and East China Seas](https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/military/experts-warn-of-chinas-growing-offensive-capability/news-story/f7b4dc7fd02a422a77409881fc2a99c4) encompassed by the Kuril Islands, Japan, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, the Philippines, Borneo, Malaysia and Indonesia.

Professor Gordon Flake from the University of Western Australia's Perth USAsia Centre told [*ABC Radio*](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/am/security-document/13053186): “It (Taiwan) is the one area where I think major power military confrontation is probably most feasible so in that context, that’s one that certainly has to be discussed.”

There is an enduring defence alliance between Australia and the US.

In summarising the history, [the Australian Embassy states](https://usa.embassy.gov.au/defence-cooperation#:~:text=History%20of%20Australia%2DUnited%20States,East%20Timor%2C%20Afghanistan%20and%20Iraq.): “Australians have fought alongside Americans in every major US military action of the last century, including World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq.”

In other words, if America was to take on China in defence of Taiwan, it’s assumed that Australia would jump to our ally’s aid – despite our increasing reliance on China as a crucial trading partner over the years.

**THE CHINA-AUSTRALIA FALLOUT**

However, Australia’s relationship with China has deteriorated significantly in recent months.

The stoush kicked off with the Huawei ban and foreign interference laws in 2018.

The list of trade sanctions grew in mid 2020 when China slapped tariffs on barley and suspended some beef exports.

In recent days, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg [again blocked a proposed Chinese takeover](https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/other-industries/chinas-bid-for-australian-construction-giant-probuild-blocked-on-national-interest-grounds/news-story/0839ac95205bcce9c7b0e072f09fa9da) of Melbourne-headquartered construction giant Probuild.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao [on Tuesday said it was the latest example](https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/discriminatory-beijing-lashes-josh-frydenberg-over-rejected-takeover-bid/news-story/daa820cde6b72377ce92120da366bee1) of Australia “imposing discriminatory measures on Chinese companies”.",2021-01-14 20:39:24

I think an easy route for someone looking to develop apps is by first learning a programming language on a site like HackerRank, and then building a few small projects useful to the developer (even if there are a million similar apps on the store). 

You may want to start with a project where you can use external APIs to retrieve all of your data...For example maybe an app the displays current stock prices which you can retrieve from yahoo finance or another site easily. 

There are tools like React Native which allow you to write javascript that can compile into code compatible with both iOS and Android.

1. Take Sarah's quizzes (look under Course Tips for a list of class resources. I completed the course a while back, so I forget the exact name--something like ""Macroeconomics Quick Quizzes"").
2. Learn how to draw the graphs so that even if the wording is tripping you up, you can draw it out and know the answer.
3. Remember that the long-run aggregate supply curve only shifts with a change in technology or resources. That tip alone saved my bacon on several questions. I had no clue what the answer should be, but on questions with no change in technology/resources, three of the answers mentioned the LRAS shifting and only one said that the LRAS would stay the same, so I knew that that had to be the correct answer.
4. Know how to calculate opportunity cost.
5. Remember that changes in price cause movement along the curve; they do not cause the curve to shift. 
6. Memorize  half of the chart located about halfway down the page at this link: [https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-macroeconomics/ap-financial-sector/monetary-policy-apmacro/a/monetary-policy](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-macroeconomics/ap-financial-sector/monetary-policy-apmacro/a/monetary-policy). The title starts ""Monetary policy influences aggregate demand..."" When you start your OA, write down what you remember on your whiteboard. If you know that one causes unemployment to increase, then the other causes unemployment to decrease, so you only need to memorize the info for one type of policy (expansionary or contractionary), not both.

For breadth as bcom id recommend either of these
- mast10005 (if you did well in methods its a great choice and should boost the email while being quite useful)
- unib10006 (ngl just found out about this class but would help with econometrics)
- comp10001 (great to have some level of understanding of comp sci and python for finance industry)

A pre standard first sem course plan would be;
S1:
Pof, ara, qm1, breadth
S2:
Lvl2 com,ifa1 or another lvl2 com,  intro micro, breadth
(Can do intro macro s1 2022/2nd yr just fine)
After this id recommend deciding if you want to major in acc (acc in uni is incredibly hard to score well in due to being marked on a v harsh curve). Bc in all honesty uni acc just ain't the same as hs and is so dry compared to more interesting majors putting it very bluntly, econ/metrics is a far more interesting major. But you should study what you feel you'll enjoy and score best in (compare you qm1 marks to your ara)

Also if you wanna work in finance, accounting isnt an essential major. You could always major in econ and take units focused in econometrics and finance (like econ30024, ecom30002, econ30025, ecom30004 and/or econ30020 as you major cores).

joenorwood77,"yearn.finance price today is $34,998.30 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $797,406,767 USD. yearn.finance is up 12.94% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #38, with a market cap of $1,048,856,858 USD. It has a circulating supply of 29,969 YFI coins and a max. supply of 30,000 YFI coins.

The top exchanges for trading in yearn.finance are currently Binance, Huobi Global, BiKi, OKEx, and HBTC. 


What Is Yearn.Finance (YFI)?

Yearn.finance is an aggregator service for decentralized finance (DeFi) investors, using automation to allow them to maximize profits from yield farming.

Its goal is to simplify the ever-expanding DeFi space for investors who are not technically minded or who wish to interact in a less committal manner than serious traders.

Launched in February 2020, the service, formerly known as iEarn, has seen huge growth in recent months as new products debuted and developers released in-house token YFI.


Who Are the Founders of Yearn.Finance?

Yearn.finance is the brainchild of Andre Cronje. After leaving the iEarn project in February 2020, Cronje returned to oversee a rebirth, with new tools emerging and YFI going live in July.

Since then, its fortunes have turned around, with assets under total value locked coming in at just over $1 billion as of the end of September 2020.

Cronje has a long career in cryptocurrency and has become synonymous with DeFi in particular. He also has positions at smart contract ecosystem Fantom and CryptoBriefing, a resource dedicated to initial coin offerings (ICOs) and crypto media.


What Makes Yearn.Finance Unique?

Yearn.finance set out to simplify DeFi investment and activities such as yield farming for the broader investor sector.

The platform makes use of various bespoke tools to act as an aggregator for DeFi protocols such as Curve, Compound and Aave, bringing those who stake cryptocurrency the highest possible yield.

New features continue to be rolled out, these aiming, among other things, to help preserve the long-term value of the platform.

Yearn.finance makes a profit by charging withdrawal fees, currently 0.5% at the end of September 2020, as well as 5% gas subsidization fees. Due to its governance model, these can technically be changed by consensus at any time.

The target market for yearn.finance is investors who do not have the time to study the increasingly complex DeFi phenomenon from scratch, or who wish to optimize their returns.


How Many Yearn.Finance (YFI) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Yearn.finance in-house token YFI has a fixed supply of 30,000 coins. There was no premine upon launch in July 2020, and developers did not receive any starting funds: the total supply at launch was 0 YFI.

Since then, the majority of the capped supply has entered circulation, and the success of the token is reflected in its all-time high price of $41,000, which it hit in mid-September 2020. YFI was also the first cryptocurrency to become worth more than Bitcoin (BTC) per unit.

Users of yearn.finance earn YFI through providing liquidity, while token holdings dictate governance privileges.


How Is the Yearn.Finance Network Secured?

Yearn.finance users can face a high risk of losing money thanks to market conditions changing rapidly and opportunistic entities attempting to profit from less-experienced participants.

Cronje himself has sought to maintain transparency about the platform’s provenance, noting that even after code audits, yearn.finance could not be guaranteed to be 100% safe — DeFi involves inherent risk.


Where Can You Buy Yearn.Finance (YFI)?

YFI is a freely-tradable token, with pairs for cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and fiat currencies all widely available.

Major exchanges trading YFI include Binance, OKEx and Huobi Global, as well as automated market maker (AMM) Uniswap.",2021-01-17 09:59:21
deficryptodan,"You are asking a lot of good questions, which would take a lot of time to answer.  I try to do that in my [podcast](https://realdefi.buzzsprout.com/) (The Real DeFi Podcast), you're welcome to listen - I cover all the below and more in great detail.  

In short:

* Transactions are expensive.  Cost varies greatly depending on the transaction complexity and gas cost.  Anywhere between $5 and $40 if you trade during low-cost times.
* I would say $1000 per farm is too little.  If that is the amount you have, I would look at automatic solutions like those provided by Yearn Finance or indeed Harvest Finance (FARM).  They do most of the farming work for you and you can keep your funds for a while.
* Providing liquidity for ETH pairs (non-stablecoins) can be lucrative, but you face impermanent loss.  You have to know what you are doing and monitor closely.
* Some interesting projects: Curve, Sushi, Yearn Finance, Badger.  

My advice: start slowly and build your way up.",2021-01-17 17:24:56
shamusotool,"Depends if you're looking at ATM or OTM. Decay curve starts to accelerate heavily around 17-14 dte for ATM strikes, but for OTM strikes decay decelerates around 21 dte.

It's one of the weird things about options from a more academic approach. Almost all academic literature focuses on ATM options. Obviously there's a shit ton of people trading ATM options as the volume is usually heaviest there but my pure guess is that most retail trading is at OTM strikes. 

I'm curious about u/chaney3 's take here as he has more background knowledge than me although I know he doesn't have a traditional educational route. 

I've done a few MBA finance classes that were cool from an intellectual curiosity standpoint but I don't think I got anything at all from them that helped my trading.",2021-01-17 23:14:33
don_pista,"Hey, great to hear this is encouraging for you! No previous finance experience, I just have very basic understanding of accounting principles. But I have realised that the company was looking for entry level analysts (i.e. interns) with geology, mining or accounting background for this particular project, hopefully with the aim of keeping us after the project is done. So far the role has been pretty interesting - a bit of a steep learning curve, particularly with respect to creating the design/framework for the cost model, coming up with a systemic way of collecting data and implementing that data into the cost model. The data research component of the role has been alright so far as I've worked on a few technical reports before, so I know where to look for some of the information we need.

I was not expecting to land a role like this, but as stated on my original post, it all came down to improving my resume, sharpening my interview skills, and luckily, having some experience in the mining industry. Then again, the other intern who was hired for the project has a geology background, some geotechnical experience (not mining related), and some accounting experience, but they are struggling a bit with understanding some of the mining processes and terminologies.

It really sounds like you would be a great fit for the role that I got - how much experience do you have and what attracts you to become a Research Analyst in Mining and Metals instead of Consulting for example?",2021-01-18 00:21:13
outcomelessincome,"So a couple points to address:

1) I’m not saying the mattress industry is a scam, just that some specific mattresses by mattressfirm are overpriced based on their quality. I have absolutely no problem paying $600 or even $2000 for a mattress but I want the quality to reflect what I’m paying. I know for a fact the original $1.2K for this curve is a ripoff because the quality doesn’t compare to other mattresses in the same price range (nectar for example.

2) you say you sell mattresses at the price manufacturers tell you do, that is fair for brands like temperpedic.  But sleepy’s manufacturer is literally MattressFirm, so it seems MattressFirm just tries to squeeze customers for whatever they can with these mattresses. If they could tell a curve mattress for $1,200 they would,  but they know no one would pay that because there other staff in the shop at the same price that feels better. So they have a perpetual 50% off sale to make people think they’re getting a deal (as you said draw customers in). If they can sell it for $600 great but if not they have no problem going down in price, simply because the quality of the mattress is of those in the lower price range. Whereas temperpedic is a well known brand name they know the value of their mattresses and their prices are fairly consistent no matter where you are. High quality + a well recognized brand calls for a higher price, even if the margins are insanely high. 

4) I just think MattressFirm should be honest with it’s customers, instead of having a mattress listed at $1,200 and having a constant sale of 50% just list it at $600. That’s a much more fair price point based on the quality of the mattress and doesn’t involve the mind games of making customers think they’re getting a huge deal, whoever $600 is the fair price in the first place. Personally, I was going to cancel my order if I had to pay the $600 because I found other quality bed in the box mattresses in the same range. But at the $450 price I think what I’m getting for the price matches the quality so it’s worth it. It just annoys me some customers may think this mattress is worth $1,200. 

3) I live frugally in all aspects of my life, however I am willing to pay more money for more quality. I actually work in healthcare so I usually buy generic medicines vs the branded Tylenol or whatever because the quality is pretty much identical but generics are not marked up as much. I even have a whole YouTube channel talking about the importance of frugality and personal finance, not going to plug it here because I don’t need subs, but the point is that if something is not worth the value I am paying or if it is overpriced compared to competitors I will call it out no matter if it’s coffee, medicine, or a TV.",2021-01-18 01:43:10

keelaw,"Yes.  My reasons I suspect are a lot to do with my S10+ being an exynos model.

- Poor battery life
- So so low light photos
- Poor zoom
- Screen smaller than most flagships now
- Smaller hole punch
- 120hz
- Smaller curve on edge would reduce accidental touches 
- S pen will be fun
- Less lag in general performance
- So so fingerprint sensor 
- S10 only has one more year of software update 
- I want retail therapy after the rubbish 2020!


Other things I've considered:
- Defo sad to lose sd card but 256gb isnt that much extra and will  enough for me
- I don't use MST
- I'll use a case to reduce camera bump wobble and house s pen
- Cost is high but 0% finance over 2 yrs helps
- Very few competitors that I would consider
   - iPhone 12 pro max don't like iOS, big notch, sharp edges
   - oneplus camera not as good
   - xiaomi, oppo, vivo etc. I hear bad things about the UI and concerned about support outside of China 
   - Huawei, no Google

JayKanish,"You have two different options- paid and unpaid advertising. There are benefits and drawbacks to both:

&amp;#x200B;

**Paid**

&amp;#x200B;

Paid advertising means you are paying for ads, either through search engines or social media sites.

While you can scale really well with paid advertising, there's a learning curve and it can get expensive. You'd probably want to get help via a freelance site and hire a marketer to help since it can feel discouraging to spend a few hundred bucks and get nothing.

Additionally, you're charging $20 an hour so advertising costs can really eat into that. Which is why I would start with unpaid.

&amp;#x200B;

**Unpaid**

&amp;#x200B;

Unpaid is also known as organic. With this, you create a following by posting on social media (Reddit, TikTok, Facebook, etc).

Your main hurdle here is actually building your following. It takes time.

I'd recommend changing your FB account to start advertising. Join some groups in the niche (think personal finance rather than stock market groups, your target market aren't experienced traders.

Post a few times a week, provide actual value, and interact with the people you engaged with.

Also, be careful. You will run into a plethora of ""Organic Marketers"" that will sell you a course on how to create your market but everything they sell is easy enough to find on your own.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd recommend doing unpaid, make some cash selling hourly classes and then maybe scaling by making your own course.

If you have questions, DM me. This is all very basic and I could give you a little more detail so you can avoid the predatory ""entrepreneurs"" on social media.",2021-01-19 22:47:31
Lord_Pravus,"Aggressive investing, as in a taxable brokerage account? I wouldn't recommend that at your stage, assuming you want to strike an optimal balance between returns and financial stability. 

For me, personal finance is a priority system. Once you fulfill your top priority, you move down the list. My recommendation is as follows:

-$1-2k emergency fund to establish initial stability

-Contribute to 401k up to employer match

-Build emergency fund to 2-3 months expenses

-Pay off high interest debt (such as credit cards)

-Invest max contribution to an HSA (if available)

-Invest max contribution to an IRA

-Build emergency fund to 6 months expenses

-Pay off student loan debt

-Invest max contribution to 401k

-Either invest in a taxable account OR pay off low-interest debt (including mortgage)

This has worked well for me. Some of these can change in priority depending on how much you value stability. If you want the most possible returns as early as possible, you can increase investing priority... but speaking from experience, life throws curve balls and you'll wish you had some reserves available to weather the storm. 

Some people will debate whether it's worth aggressively paying off student loans. I think it is, partly from a morale perspective and partly to free up revenue, but depending on your interest rate, it might be mathematically better to invest instead. Same with a mortgage, actually. 

But I think I can safely say that investing through a taxable account this early is the wrong choice for the long term. It doesn't take full advantage of tax-free accounts, so you're immediately losing some return potential.",2021-01-19 23:30:05

benido2030,"To clarify my own thoughts (and later on act based on that...) I will write a post every month. I just want feedback on my thoughts, best case give you guys some food for thought as well and improve my crypto knowledge. I somehow picked the 20th of every month, cause ETH will go to... 10k :)

1. I / we all should get in touch with different defi projects even if you dont really use them. i have a business, but not a finance background. i have some stocks (apart from crypto obv) but I never shorted, leveraged, borrowed, lend etc. because why would I? and why would i borrow to then use this to put it somewhere else... you know the strategies. i have spend some money to use defi protocols and think this is a great investment, even if there was no financial gain. this last month I checked loopring and how it works. to understand layer 2 is crucial imo. 
2. a second project I thought about giving a try is curve (because I do have some stETH from trying liquid staking). curve is a great example why crypto UX still needs to improve to gain mainstream attention and later on usage. curve looks like 90s. compared to e.g. uni... OMG. and curve is rather successful. good thing is, I think they actually do wanna improve the page. best choice imo.  
3. we live in a crypto bubble. we are really early. always remember that. one example: there is always this argument that owning crypto (by e.g. taking it off exchanges) is so hard. whenever I hear this,  think thats bull. but this week I remembered how scared I was when I created my first wallet with metamask. I had no idea how all this works and only moved like 0.3 ETH to the wallet in case I fucked up. 
4. defi tokens will be the big winners of this cycle. alt coins from the previous cycle will have its time and gains, some new projects will also blow up, but I dont think those will perform as good as defi protocols. since ETH = defi right now I think that this will also be ETH cycle. but: i am not a ETH maxi. there will be more chains and other use cases that wont perfectly fit into ETH. 
5. i believe we wont see 5+ 30% crashes during this bull market. i made this prediction several times before and it seems to be right. there will be consolidation, but the market and its investors have matured. a ""huge"" crash will more likely be 20-25%. the first crash we saw fits this pattern. thus if you wanna sell to buy in at a lower stage (and I never did this nor will I do this in the future), just to wait too long. I also believe the bear market wont be a 80-90% correction this time. 
6. take profits. make a plan now and stick to it. I have a stack I plan to hodl, but have made a plan to exit a %. the first sell will be to recover my investment, the second sell is pure profits and ill use this stack to rebuy in case of a bear market. I still dont believe we will necessarily repeat the 4 year cycle and that selling in DEC 21 and rebuying automatically in summer 2023 will be a great decision. but if history rhymes, ill be there. if it doesnt, i took profits.

LongConvexity1,"1.  I just use glut as a term in reference to Bernanke.  The key point is you had these large growing pools of institutional cash looking for risk free/low risk assets.  I dont really care about terminology.

2.  I come at this from a finance background where we commonly use ""risk free"" to refer to certain asset classes and yields (like the UST yield curve).  Not gonna argue terminology as this is just what folks call it.  You're right about moral hazard, but even without the Greenspan put everyone will chase high risk adjusted returns.  I'm not sure what the argument is here.

3.  Lower than needed interest rates played a role but it wasn't a critical role.  One of many factors.  

4. Also the ""govt told them to lend to subprime borrowers"" story is weak.  Bank made CRA loans performed way better than comparable private lenders in those areas as banks are required to comply in a safe and sound manner (ie the govt doesn't want you taking on risk to comply with CRA).  Even so, the problem was that people didn't realize the risks they were taking, not that risks are bad.  There is a big market for subprime lending that does a lot of good for folks with marginal income.",2021-01-20 19:28:03

Developing a recovery plan for ASEAN Tourism and negotiations for a possible ASEAN-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA), as well as establishing the ASEAN Investment Facilitation Framework and the ASEAN Joint Declaration on Energy Transition and Energy Security are among the 10 Priority Economic Deliveries (PEDs) proposed by Brunei Darussalam for the ASEAN Economic Community.




All of the 10 PEDs under the three strategic thrusts of Recovery, Digitalisation and Sustainability were presented by Minister at the Prime Minister’s Office and Minister of Finance and Economy II Dato Seri Setia Dr Awang Haji Mohd Amin Liew bin Abdullah in his keynote address, during the ASEAN Business Advisory Council’s (ASEAN-BAC) 2021 Chairmanship Handover ceremony at the International Convention Centre yesterday.




Dato Seri Setia Dr Awang Haji Mohd Amin Liew said, “As ASEAN member countries gradually resume economic activities, the region’s economy has started to pick up, showing signs of our ability to adapt to this new environment. However, the pace of improvement has remained moderate. The spread of the COVID-19 virus has not yet subsided and many countries continue to be affected. A full-fledged recovery, in my opinion, seems much further down the road and will require continued unfaltering cooperation.”




He added, “It is imperative that we keep our sights on our ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) integration agenda. It is an opportunity for us to work together, to look into the immediate long-term goals of our efforts to revive the ASEAN Economy, from ensuring that our workforce and businesses are equipped with the necessary skills and tools to adapt to any economic disruption, while shaping ASEAN into becoming more resilient, dynamic and to be ahead of the curve in championing new solutions towards sustainability; hence ensuring a better future for the generations to come.”




The minister continued, “It is therefore fitting, that in 2021, for ASEAN to intensify efforts toward building an ASEAN Community that is inclusive, sustainable, resilient and dynamic.







“The pandemic has changed the dynamics of the world. It has definitely fast-forwarded ASEAN’s shift towards digitalisation. It goes without saying that digitalisation is and will remain to be a key component of economic growth in the 21st Century,” he said.




“Thus, it is crucial for ASEAN to safeguard the cybersecurity of the region by enhancing our capabilities, while also being cognizant of new and emerging technologies. Additionally, ASEAN must continue to demonstrate its resolute support and commitment for multilateralism.




“Under the theme ‘We Care, We Prepare, We Prosper’, Brunei Darussalam’s main focus is on three priority areas, namely caring for the people and each other’s wellbeing, preparing for future opportunities and challenges, and prospering together in a unified region.




“In this regard, Brunei Darussalam has proposed 10 Priority Economic Deliveries (PEDs) for the ASEAN Economic Community which are divided into three strategic thrusts, namely Recovery in progressing together towards the region’s economic recovery; Digitalisation in leveraging on new technologies and digitalisation for a resilient ASEAN; and Sustainability, which is in pursuit of advancing an inclusive and sustainable economic growth in ASEAN.




“On Recovery, which covers four of our PEDs, first is to conduct a comprehensive assessment to streamline Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs) in ASEAN member states. This includes the development of an NTM toolkit which can be used to review NTMs in terms of compliance, enforcement and design.




“Second is to develop a recovery plan for ASEAN Tourism, which is one of the most impacted sectors. This plan will help provide comprehensive and coordinated solutions to enhance sustainability, resilience and social inclusiveness in ASEAN Tourism industry during and post pandemic.




“Third, we aim to announce the launching of the negotiations for the possible ASEAN-Canada FTA. The foundation of this FTA has been laid out.




“Fourth is to develop the ASEAN Investment Facilitation Framework, which would facilitate investments into the region and prepare for the post COVID-19 new norm. Furthermore, it would help integrate ASEAN into global value chains and contribute to ASEAN’s comprehensive recovery effort.




“Under the second strategic thrust, Digitalisation, we have two PEDs, which are the fifth and the sixth. For the fifth PED, is to develop a work place to implement the ASEAN agreement on Electronic Commerce. This work plan will guide member states on how to advance the effective implementation of the ASEAN Agreement on E-Commerce over the next five years, both at regional and national levels.




“The sixth PED is developing a regional action plan in the area of cyberspace, as recommended by the 2015 United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (UNGGE) report. This will help the region in implementing the cyber norms and cooperation activities to develop the required capabilities.




“The third strategic thrust is sustainability, which consists of four PEDs, our seventh to 10th. The seventh PED is on developing an ASEAN framework which will support food, agriculture and forestry, small producers, cooperatives and MSMEs that have been severely impacted by the pandemic.




“The eighth PED focusses on energy, and that is to develop an ASEAN Joint Declaration on Energy Transition and Energy Security. This is expected to set out ways for ASEAN to cooperate in the pursuit of energy transitions and security.




“The next PED is looking at developing a framework for circular economy for the AEC. As a new concept, it is important to identify at this early stage the key areas of circular economy which are of relevance to the work of the AEC, drawing upon global and regional best practices,” he said.




“The last PED is on delivering key recommendations to advance ASEAN cooperation in mineral resource development in light of opportunities arising from global trends and shifts in the global minerals and metals markets. This PED will contribute to the sustainable community development goals of the AEC Blueprint 2025.




“There are three phases of a crisis: Emergency, Regression and Recovery. I believe, we are already entering the Recovery phase. Therefore, continuous sharing of real-time information, lessons learnt and experiences are an essential part of our pathway to recovery.




“It is important for us to keep in mind that economic recovery is evident by the resumption of business operations, recovery of employment levels as our people go back to work, and the easing of border movements, but true economic recovery is only fully realised when we demonstrate the ability to adapt to the new environment and possess a preparedness to combat similar crises and in pursuit of long-term sustainable growth,” the minister said.




“As the end users of ASEAN economic agreements and initiatives, we recognise that the private sector is a vital component of our economic integration agenda. Your expertise in relevant fields is invaluable in our post recovery efforts and the achievement of our deliverables, past, present and future.




“Digital technologies have played a crucial role during the pandemic, hence, the acceleration of digitalisation is key in our efforts to adapt in a post COVID-19 world,” the minister said.




“This is a chance for ASEAN countries to transition to a smart economy adapting to new ways of doing business, especially for our MSMEs to grow. It is therefore imperative for the public-private partnership be elevated to greater heights, to work hand-in-hand to ensure our short to long-term recovery goals are achieved; and thus for the region to strive, and be more sustainable and resilient in an inclusive manner.”

sneakpeek_bot,"&gt; # Commentary: GST hike unavoidable, will probably take place in 2023

&gt; A GST hike has been on the cards for some time. We should also expect further tax increases, possibly stamp duty increases, after the pandemic blows over, says Simon Poh.

&gt; SINGAPORE: We know tax increases are on the cards in Singapore. The Government had earlier announced the GST hike in Parliament in 2018, to be implemented sometime in this term of government.

&gt; 

&gt; The question is when it will happen. But after a year wrought by a deadly pandemic that saw Singapore tap on billions in our reserves, this is more likely to happen in 2023, rather than 2024 or 2025.

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; The pandemic has devastated our economies and the livelihoods of our people. Our national Budget has not been spared either.

&gt; 

&gt; There are some exceptions but with a collapsed world economy, tourism and domestic demand, many companies will see lower profit margins, leading to shortfalls in projected taxes and other forms of government revenues.

&gt; While Singapore’s GDP is expected to grow by 4 to 6 per cent this year according to the Trade and Industry Ministry, firms and households expect support from the Government given the poor outlook.

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; The timing of the GST hike will very much depend on the pandemic situation, which is still very fluid.

&gt; 

&gt; Global vaccinations are progressing slower than expected, as advanced countries grapple with the need to ramp up healthcare delivery systems.

&gt; 

&gt; Worse, we are still witnessing record infections in many countries including Malaysia, Japan and the US, where fresh curbs have been slapped on.

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Far from flattening the curve, the seven-day average of new daily global cases have been up an uptrend, reaching new highs this month of almost 800,000.

&gt; 

&gt; There are also remaining uncertainties including whether the COVID-19 vaccines prevent transmission, how long immunity lasts and how long more international borders will stay shut if new waves of infections continue.

&gt; 

&gt; SINGAPORE’S RECOVERY UNDER PRESSURE

&gt; 

&gt; Although Singapore has shifted into Phase 3, as a small and open economy reliant on global connections, the pace of our recovery will depend on how much other countries can bring down infection numbers, and whether international borders can gradually reopen.

&gt; 

&gt; So long as lockdowns are still prevalent, our aviation and tourism industries will remain in the doldrums. Singapore’s rebound will be muted if we rely mainly on propping up the domestic economy to tread water.

&gt; A man rests on a bench at the Elizabeth Walk park in Singapore on Oct 21, 2020. (Photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman)

&gt; The gradual recovery of our economy should take place towards the second half of the year. The irony is that Singapore’s COVID-19 numbers may increase with more imported cases when that happens but should not be a cause for immediate alarm.

&gt; 

&gt; HOW DETAILS OF THE GST HIKE MAY BE ANNOUNCED

&gt; 

&gt; Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat dedicated substantial time in February 2020 to explain why Singapore cannot defer the GST hike. He emphasised the need to fund broad–based increases in recurrent health spending, signalling that a responsible government should have “the discipline to raise revenue in a timely manner”.

&gt; 

&gt; I expect him to continue this prudent stance but take a calibrated approach to defer the GST hike until 2023, since the COVID-19 situation is unlikely to improve drastically by Budget Day on Feb 16.

&gt; 

&gt; But he may take a leaf from his earlier book to announce then the implementation date of the 2 per cent hike in 2023 to prepare the public for this hard decision.

&gt; ­Delaying the hike further until 2024 or 2025 will seriously weaken Singapore’s fiscal position. The Government is expected to chalk up a record deficit of about S$50 billion or more in the 2020 fiscal year - the first year of a new term of government - substantially funded from drawing down past reserves.

&gt; 

&gt; Both corporate, individual income taxes and GST, are expected to dip in the near term, so long as these tax rates remain unchanged.

&gt; 

&gt; Meanwhile, recurring expenditures, especially healthcare spending, are expected to surge. Healthcare has already risen by 11 per cent annually from 2012 to 2017. This increase itself is expected to exceed the projected additional revenue from a 2 per cent GST hike and it would not be right to use past reserves to fund recurring expenditure.

&gt; 

&gt; A 2 percentage point GST hike will raise additional government revenue of about 0.7 per cent of GDP per year, DPM Heng had pointed out in 2018.

&gt; 

&gt; A phased increase is more palatable to consumers but creates additional compliance hassle for firms already grappling with the challenges wrought by COVID-19 who must make the adjustments twice.

&gt; People queue to pay for groceries at a supermarket in Singapore on Apr 3, 2020. (Photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman)

&gt; Here again, the chances are that the Government may a leaf from the last GST hike in 2007 to bite the bullet and go for the full 2 percentage point hike. This will provide greater certainty for businesses.

&gt; 

&gt; OTHER TAXES COULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED

&gt; 

&gt; The Singapore Government could take a calibrated approach and consider imposing other tax increases.

&gt; 

&gt; However, in the context of a global economic downturn, the Singapore Government is unlikely to hike corporate income taxes or personal income taxes, given the dampening effects on businesses still struggling to find growth and on Singapore’s overall international competitiveness in attracting foreign direct investments and ability to support jobs.

&gt; 

&gt; Within the Asia-Pacific region, Singapore and Hong Kong lead the pack in having the lowest headline corporate tax rates of 17 per cent and 16.5 per cent respectively.

&gt; 

&gt; These rates have been maintained for more than a decade while neighbouring Asia-Pacific countries have been gradually lowering their corporate tax rates over these years to narrow the gaps.

&gt; 

&gt; Indonesia dropped theirs from 25 per cent to 22 per cent for 2021 and to 20 per cent in 2022 just last year – a rate on par with Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia’s.

&gt; 

&gt; To take a drastic approach to hike our corporate tax rate and reverse the trend of our gradual decline in rates over the past 40 years will not be wise in this environment, nor are there many historical precedents.

&gt; 

&gt; There is one bright spot that might help with boosting government coffers. Among all the bad news, the property market has proven to be surprisingly resilient, suggesting the market has huge liquidity.

&gt; 

&gt; The cooling measures over 2013, 2018 and more recent changes might have tempered speculation, putting the market on stronger footing. This strong performance by the property market suggests this sector may provide a strong tax base should the Government decide to raise wealth taxes rather than income tax.

&gt; Singapore's local property market is ""starting to see renewed positive sentiments and some gathering of momentum in prices"", DPM Heng had said on Monday, sparking speculation of more cooling measures.

&gt; ""We do not want to see the property market run ahead of the underlying economic fundamentals,"" he added.

&gt; There is scope to tax the property market to these ends. Most foreigners tend to buy homes in excess of S$1 million in the Core Central Region.

&gt; A view of private residential homes and executive condominiums in Singapore. (File photo: Reuters)

&gt; One way to do this is to further enhance the progressivity of the stamp duty regime by tweaking the stamp duty rates for larger houses.

&gt; 

&gt; Although the buyer’s stamp duty was raised for residential properties in excess of S$1 million in value in 2018, the Government could add a further increase to residences in excess of S$2 million in value. This measure should not affect Singaporeans in the lower- and middle-income groups.

&gt; 

&gt; Some people have argued to bring back estate duties, removed after 2008.

&gt; 

&gt; For deaths prior to this date, estate tax was payable on the principal value of property passed onto beneficiaries, subject to exemptions of S$9 million for residential properties and S$600,000 for non-residential assets.

&gt; 

&gt; If the Government does so, it would be for tax progressiveness rather than fiscal need, given the small amount of taxes collected, the small number of taxpayer base and the fact that it is easy for the ultra-rich to significantly reduce this tax through tax planning.

&gt; 

&gt; Nobody likes taxes, not even Ministers for Finance, as DPM Heng put it.

&gt; But of all the options available, GST, the fourth largest contributor to government revenue after Net Investment Returns Contribution, corporate and personal income taxes, remains the best one.

This sub while sometimes insanely relatable, is basically the biggest downer on reddit. Most people who post here are miserable in their lives and most of the time it's no fault of their own. 

My advice to you is to unsubscribe from this sub and follow some personal finance subs. Really become knowledgeable in all things finance. Learn to invest, learn to budget, and learn to be frugal. 


Your priorities should be as follows:

1. Spend less than you make. 
2. Invest the difference.
3. Work on increasing your income, but keep your spending static.
4. Never buy anything you can't afford.


Many will dismiss this as hustle culture, but thats not what I'm pushing at all. Work life is really shitty 95% of the time, but sitting here in despair won't do anything for you. If you're going to be subjected to this hell either way you might as well make the best of it. 

At the very least if you follow the above steps you'll minimize the likelihood that your situation becomes the bleakest of the bleak. Best case scenario you retire 5, 10, 15, even 40 years earlier then you normally would. Maybe you won't retire early, but you'll become financially stable enough to work 30 hours a week instead of 40. Maybe everything else goes to shit, but your preparation early in life prevents you from being homeless.

Either way financially preparing yourself and being mindful of your finances has no downsides. It will always benefit you in some way. 

You can still hate your job, society, and the way things are, but becoming complacent and not planning is only harming yourself.

You're letting them win when you give up and subject yourself to a life of wage slavery and misery. Top level capitalists and society want you to give up and neglect your finances. It keeps you a slave. They can't exploit somebody who's financially independent. 

The worst part is what I've described isn't even hard. There may be a slight learning curve, but once you're going it takes like 15 minutes a week.",2021-01-23 02:48:17

joenorwood77,"Curve DAO Token price today is $2.08 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $476,876,774 USD. Curve DAO Token is up 20.69% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #68, with a market cap of $408,554,249 USD. It has a circulating supply of 196,426,517 CRV coins and a max. supply of 3,303,030,299 CRV coins.

The top exchanges for trading in Curve DAO Token are currently Binance, Huobi Global, BitZ, OKEx, and HBTC. 


What Is Curve (CRV)?

Curve is a decentralized exchange for stablecoins that uses an automated market maker (AMM) to manage liquidity.

Launched in January 2020, Curve is now synonymous with the decentralized finance (DeFi) phenomenon, and has seen significant growth in the second half of 2020.

In August, Curve launched a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), with CRV as its in-house token. The DAO uses Ethereum-based creation tool Aragon to connect multiple smart contracts used for users’ deposited liquidity. Issues such as governance, however, differ from Aragon in their weighting and other respects.


Who Are the Founders of Curve?

The founder and CEO of Curve is Michael Egorov, a Russian scientist who has various experience with cryptocurrency-related enterprises.

In 2015, he co-founded and became CTO of NuCypher, a cryptocurrency business building privacy-preserving infrastructure and protocols.

Egorov is also the founder of decentralized bank and loans network LoanCoin.

Curve’s regular team is part of the CRV allocation structure, and will receive tokens according to a two-year vesting schedule as part of the initial launch plan.

In August 2020, Egorov said that he “overreacted” by locking up a large amount of CRV tokens as a response to yearn.finance’s voting power, awarding himself 71% of governance in the process.


What Makes Curve Unique?

Curve has gained considerable attention by following its remit as an AMM specifically for stablecoin trading.

The launch of the DAO and CRV token brought in further profitability, given CRV’s use for governance, as it is awarded to users based on liquidity commitment and length of ownership.

The explosion in DeFi trading has ensured Curve’s longevity, with AMMs turning over huge amounts of liquidity and associated user profits.

As such, Curve caters to anyone involved in DeFi activities such as yield farming and liquidity mining, as well as those looking to maximize returns without risk by holding notionally non-volatile stablecoins.

The platform makes money by charging a modest fee which is paid to liquidity providers.


How Many Curve (CRV) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Curve (CRV) launched in August 2020, along with the Curve DAO. Its purpose is to function as a governance medium, incentive structure and fee payment method, along with long-term earnings method for liquidity providers.

The total CRV supply is 3.03 billion tokens, the majority of which (62%) are distributed to liquidity providers. The remainder is divided as follows: 30% to shareholders, 3% to employees and 5% to a community reserve. The shareholder and employee allocations come with a two-year vesting schedule.

CRV had no premine, and the gradual unlocking of tokens means that around 750 million should be in circulation one year after launch.


How Is the Curve Network Secured?

Curve carries the standard risks associated with depositing funds in smart contracts and dealing with AMMs, namely impermanent loss.

As Curve only supports stablecoins, the risk of markets moving too quickly is reduced, but users can still lose money once markets are rebalanced to reflect cross-market prices.

Curve has been audited, but this does not do anything to counter the risks involved in being exposed to a specific cryptocurrency.


Where Can You Buy Curve (CRV)?

CRV is a freely-tradable token and is available against cryptocurrency, stablecoin and fiat currency pairs on major exchanges.

These include Binance, OKEx and Huobi Global, which hold the lion’s share of trading volume as of September 2020.",2021-01-23 10:44:37
OOWMPP,"**This was written on 2021 January 23** Hello. I developed a very comprehensive math model to predict the movement of a stock's prices based on the number of options issued, the option's prices, and the option's the strike price. We all know that if there are more puts for a stock than there are calls for the same stock, the investor's sentiments are bearish for that stock. 

We also know if there is a price premium for a put then there is for a call, that once again, the investors are bearish. 

So I developed a math model that factors these two things to determine the price of the stock if one person owned all the calls and puts of a given stock, and what the price of the stock should be such that this ""universal buyer"" has a maximum profit. 


**THIS MESSAGE WAS WRITTEN ON JANUARY 2018.**

Howdy folks, 

First of all, I apologize about the poor formatting here. If anyone wants my spreadsheets which comes with the equations and algorithms in the proper cell, I'll be happy to share it with you, but only if you're an academic or institutional investor. I'd love to get your insights and thoughts about this offline if you're an academic or an institutional investor.  

I a developing a math model for stocks based on the entire universe of calls and puts which expire on January 2018. My assumptions in developing this model, which I call the Omniscient Option Writer’s Model (OOWM), are the following:
1.	The options writers are the smartest investors. They’re like a Supercomputing Godhead.  
2.	If a person were to buy the entire calls/puts for a stock whose expiration date is on January 19th, 2018, there is a range of stock prices that this Universal Options Investor (UOI) would profit. Note, that the motives of the OOW and the UOI are opposing. 
3.	There is a stock price where the UOI would make the least money, and this coincides with the OOW making their greatest profit. This stock price which maximizes the OOW is, imaginatively, called the OOW’s Max Profit Price, OOWMPP.
4.	Conversely, there is a stock price that the UOI would make the most money, and this coincides with the OOW losing the most money.
5.	I’m assuming that the future movement of the stock is based on the OOW Stock Price. So another words, today’s stock price will converge to the OOWMPP on Friday, January 19th, 2018.

To determine the OOWMPP, I must net the entire universe of calls and puts which expire next January 19th. From experience, this requires an iterative algorithm. But just to give you an idea of how I determine the OOWMPP for a stock like AAPL, we will look at the entire options for AAPL. These strike prices for the calls/options are all found here: https://www.google.com/finance/option_chain?q=NASDAQ%3AAAPL&amp;ei=FgDXWPHFIoaa2AbhtY_gAQ
 
I do this for the entire calls and puts. I graph the total gains/losses VS the stock price for the OOW. For AAPL with a stock price on $139.04. I have it available if you are interested. 

If you graph this, you’ll see that this curve has an apogee (a maximum), and that it intersects the X-axis twice. The points where it intersects the X-axis represents the stock prices where the OOW breaks even. 

The two stock prices where the OOW breaks even are exactly: 
First $0 Gains stock price  - $67.73
Second $0 Gains stock price - $148.32

So another words, the OOW would only make money if the AAPL were priced between $67.73 - $148.32. 

In order to determine the MAXIMUM profit and the OOWMPP at which the maximum profit occurs, we see based on these data points that the OOWMPP occurs at around $110. When I “zoom in” on this model and test prices from $100-$120 using a $1 increment instead of a $10 increment, I see, once again, that the OOWMPP is at $110. As a matter of fact, when I superfine tune this and use a $0.01 resolution, I see that the OOWMPP is EXACTLY $110. 

First $0 Gains stock price  - $67.73
Second $0 Gains stock price - $148.32
OOWMPP - $110.00

ineednoBELL,"Not sure if you have CS related background, but i was a poly grad with finance diploma in CS now. Personally found that the intro mod CS1101S, has a very steep learning curve for beginners. Uni math is on a different level. Even if the math is doable for you, the bell curve is very steep and its very hard to score. I found CS2030 fun but i didnt score well. CS3230 is my most hated and my worst scoring module. It feels like my effort studying for that module is useless. 

As for headstart, i think you could start learning about discrete math to ease you into learning algorithms, and helps in you in programming. Language wise id say learn java because the syntax is pretty strict and needs some time getting used to. Its also the most used language in your first 2 years.

BobSanchez47,"Good job maxing your Roth and having an emergency fund! You’re doing well! Pat yourself on the back.

Yes, you’ve slightly set yourself back by not adding to your Roth earlier. But don’t sweat it. A significant percentage of 29-year-olds have nothing invested at all. You’re still ahead of the curve. And you can still retire with a lot of tax-free and tax-deferred money if you play your cards right from now on, especially once you’re a fully fledged doctor.

With that said, here’s my “personal finance” advice. Keep maxing your Roth. If you have money to spare, consider putting it in your employer’s plan. You’ll be able to roll the 401(k) over into a traditional or Roth IRA when you part ways with that employer (which should be within a few years, since you’ll no longer be a resident). It’s possible you’ll be able to roll it over now if your plan permits “in service” rollovers.

Now, here’s my “investing” advice. You indicate that you’re interested in stocks and actively managed ETFs that have done well in 2020. The problem is that you’re “chasing returns”. This is not a good strategy. I recommend doing some research to see the data which indicates chasing yesterday’s hot stock is not a good strategy.

I strongly recommend sticking with Vanguard’s index funds for all your investing. Buying and selling individual stocks is risky and tax inefficient. Buying actively managed funds like ARKF is also tax inefficient and will result in you losing money every year to high fees. 

Definitely do not sell your VFIAX/VOO in your taxable account to buy another investment. You’ll be paying capital gains taxes, which will make the move even worse.

If you do want to slightly improve your investment strategy, I recommend the following. First, direct the majority of your incoming money to VTSAX (or VTI if you do ETFs) rather than VFIAX/VOO. The total stock market fund is more diversified, so you should see benefits over time. Second, consider directing some money into VTIAX/VXUS (Vanguard’s total non-US index fund). This offers significant diversification at the cost of slightly higher fees and taxes.

Good luck! Let me know if you have questions.",2021-01-24 08:49:01
urban_squid,"**Doug Ford’s hypocrisy in firing lockdown critic Roman Baber from the Conservatives is stunning
Baber was validly criticizing the increasingly draconian measures and their unintended side effects**

By Marty Gobin
OPINION 22 Jan 2021

Politicians who want to appear concerned but don’t comply with the pandemic guidelines they espouse, like staying away from other humans unless necessary, are ubiquitous these days.

The pseudo-religious pageantry usually involves a press conference with COVID conscious elected officials and bureaucrats. They stand in a V-formation, hands solemnly clasped in front of them, wearing masks (until they decide to speak), and distanced just enough that observers can tell they’re keeping their distance from other humans, but not quite so far as to be out of the camera’s field of view. After all, how would we know that they’re following their own advice to stay away from other people if they’re standing too far away to be seen? If they could catch or transmit the Ebola virus by being in the same room as others they wouldn’t dream of it, but this is different: The public needs to see how seriously our politicians take COVID-19, even if that means not taking it seriously.

One such display by the prophets of the COVID cult happened in Toronto on January 12. In a live briefing, Premier Doug Ford, the minister of health, and the attorney general got together in the same room as a couple medical yes men to announce a province-wide house arrest for the foreseeable future. The order-in-council they announced would last 14 days, but that’s only because that’s the longest period permitted by statute before needing to extend it (thus the lie in March 2020 that Ontarians’ civil liberties would be suspended for “two weeks to flatten the curve""). Disobeying the order is punishable by up to one year of imprisonment, a fine of $100,000, or both.

During the briefing, Ford instructed viewers to work from home where possible, despite having assembled with colleagues for a press event that could have been conducted remotely by Zoom, Skype, or a rotary phone. But the cabinet was seen to be concerned about following public health advice, and that’s what really mattered.

A few days later, Roman Baber, member of Provincial Parliament for York Centre, published a letter criticizing the increasingly draconian lockdowns and their unintended side effects. Whether Baber’s thesis about the utility of lockdowns is correct, he raised an issue that has so far been ignored by the Ford government: That anyone who has taken economics 101 knows that lockdowns will involve trade-offs, and the trade-offs should be considered in analyzing the utility of lockdowns.

For all the ever-changing “modelling” of projected COVID-19 deaths if lockdowns are not imposed, Ontario’s cabinet has not released any models of what lives the lockdowns have cost in terms of untreated medical issues, suicides, and overdoses. The lockdowns have also unquestionably damaged the economy, which, it’s worth remembering, funds the health care system that is needed to save lives. But these issues are not in vogue like COVID-19 deaths, so the cabinet has no desire to subject them to “modelling,” especially if it suggests that the cabinet is increasing the province’s body count.

Baber could be incorrect about his concerns (we don't know because the provincial government refuses to have an adult discussion about it), but can’t be dismissed as an anti-vaxxer, anti-masker, or uninformed kook. He lived under, and escaped, the Soviet Union in the 1980s while Ford was still living a carefree life as an alleged hash dealer. In the 2000s, Baber worked and studied hard to become a lawyer while Ford was inheriting a family business that someone else built. While Ford was struggling with a teleprompter at press briefings in between repeated violations of the sub judice convention, discussing what the sentences ought to be for presumptively innocent individuals charged with breaching his orders who had yet to even have had their first appearance, let alone a trial, Baber was the chair of the standing committee on justice policy committee at Queen’s Park, overseeing the provincial ministries tasked with upholding the rule of law in Ontario.

In short, if someone had to consult with an individual capable of discussing constitutional law, one’s duties as a member of the provincial legislature, the salutary and deleterious effects of legislation that might ultimately be the subject of discussion in an Oakes analysis when Ford’s OICs are inevitably subjected (successfully or not) to Charter challenges, how to scrutinize expert witnesses’ medical opinions, and what it is like to actually live in a society where central planners and technocrats determine what is “essential” through the force of law, the person to talk to would be Baber and not Ford.

So, as one might expect from the mind of someone whose best argument against political dissidents is to repeatedly call them “yahoos,” Ford immediately booted Baber out of the Progressive Conservative party, an almost certain death blow to any chances of Baber's re-election.

That was the penalty for simply questioning the wisdom of the cabinet. Yet when former Finance Minister Rod Phillips actually disregarded the province’s public health advice by vacationing abroad and Ford denied knowledge of it until admitting he was aware after being accused of incompetence if he actually didn’t know where his finance minister was for weeks, neither left the PC caucus. Phillips was permitted to leave the cabinet but still remained in the caucus as an MPP adding to his pension, and Ford imposed no penalties on himself after demonstrating a total lack of moral courage by throwing his friend under the bus for conduct he condoned until caught.

The takeaway is that, as with all its unnecessarily in-person choreographed press briefings, disregarding the party’s public health pronouncements is tolerated as long as an MPP is seen to agree with them. But if, rather than being a hypocrite, a member shows any sign of integrity by engaging in heresy and voices opposition to the party, going so far as to suggest that the party might be killing people, they have no business working with Doug Ford.",2021-01-24 11:16:57
ToBeAndNot," To directly answer your question, putting it all in a target date fund is fine. I tend to prefer recommending having your absolute basic cost of living funded by an SPIA and everything else in equities (VTWAX is fine), but a target date fund is usually fine.

I also just wrote this somewhere else, and it seems to apply here.

&gt; Is a tilt towards dividend ETFs and fixed income a bad idea?

As far as dividends are concerned, it's not a bad idea, but it's also not a good idea. It's a neutral idea. There's no evidence to prefer dividends over capital gains, and there's no evidence that dividends somehow do better than capital gains during a bear market. There's also no evidence for the converse. All you're really doing is concentrating your portfolio. Modigliani and Miller famously demonstrated that from a business capital structure, dividends vs capital reinvestment vs share buybacks provide the exact same value to investors.

Bonds tend to be somewhere between uncorrelated and slightly negatively correlated to stocks. If stocks are in a bear market, there's no real reason to believe that bonds will also be doing poorly. bonds can also happen to also do poorly during a bear market, but central banks have some influence over how bonds are doing and they try not to enact policy (such as raising the base yield curve) that leads to bonds doing poorly at the same time stocks are doing poorly.

All this being said, there's only one retirement income source that is guaranteed to not do poorly during a bear market: contractual income through something like a pension or annuity. The short story is that most retirement income experts will say that you should have your rice and beans money covered by a contractionual income source, and everything else in equities. For a full explanation of this, Wade Pfau's ""Safety First Retirement Planning"" is an incredibly well written book that covers planning for different kinds of retirement income expenditures.

For a quick explanation as to why annuities makes sense contrary to the typical story, here's an old comment of mine: 

&gt;People say annuities are a scam because they've had a bad experience with someone selling them something they didn't need and conflated that with the product rather than the sales person or their own understanding of the product. It's always strange to me that every expect in retirement income except 1 (William Bengen) recommends covering your rice and beans money with an annuity, but almost nobody has one. Most of what I'm going to be saying comes from Wade Pfau's ""Safety First Retirement Planning"" and Moshe Milevsky's ""Pensionize Your Nest Egg"". If you're going to read one of those books, read Pfau's. Professor Milevsky writes more dense books that can be hard to read.

&gt;they specifically recommend a Single Premium Immediate Annuities (SPIA) or Single Premium Deferred Annuities (SPDA) and have it cover you and a partner. They specifically do not recommend getting additional features such as it being guaranteed or variable rates. The idea that they present is pretty simple. Instead of bonds, have enough money in an annuity to cover your rice and beans expenses and have everything else in equities. Milevsky has shown two things. First, you need less money in an annuity than you need bonds to provide the same amount of fixed income reliability. You need about 30%-50% more in bonds than you have in annuity to have the same income reliability. Due to having more of your money in equities, he has also shown that over an average lifetime, you typically leave more legacy and can take more advantage of good market conditions by increasing your discretionary spending if you use annuities for your retirement fixed income over bonds.

&gt;Why do annuities make sense? There's the concept of risk pooling that most people don't quite understand. Any arbitrary person might live until they're 95+, thus this person needs to plan to live until 95+. They need to plan to make sure their portfolio has longevity. This person financing their retirement with stocks and bonds needs to allocate bonds more heavily in their portfolio to make sure they have longevity. Now suppose we have 100 people. On average, these people will live an average lifetime not 95+, but any one of them may live until they're 95+. If they are each financing their own retirement, they each need to plan to live to 95+ and allocate their bonds accordingly. On the other hand, if they pooled their longevity risk together, they would only need to fund 100 average lifetimes rather than 100 95+ lifetimes. This is why single premium annuities are the cheapest way to finance a basic retirement income. You need to plan for a shorter lifetime if you pool risk rather than if you attempt to finance it yourself.

&gt;There is a concern people have about inflation. The recommended annuities don't adjust for inflation, but you don't need every individual asset in your portfolio to adjust for inflation, you just need your entire portfolio to generally grow with it. Also realized inflation is often different than Fed targeted inflation. If you own your residence or have a mortgage, you have protected yourself against one of the largest sources of inflation. Pfau recommends if you are noticing that your annuity isn't covering your core expenses, buy another.",2021-01-28 09:19:02

Leecifer19,"I don’t think it’s any one platform. There are multiple sectors. So by sector:

Lending: Aave. While they started as ETHLend and rebranded in 2018, Aave has pioneered overcollateralized loans and flash loans, while offering depositors a variable APY for passive income. While Maker has dominance right now, I think Aave is going to grow with DeFi and offer more products. I’m going to guess Aave is going to see their price increase beyond the price of COMP soon.

Aave keeps pioneering and expanding their reach in the Lending sector.

DEXs: This one is hard to say, but I think it’ll be hard to unseat Uniswap from the top spot. Once V3 is launched, UNI is going to blow up beyond what we can imagine.

Most tokens are listed on Uniswap before they are listed anywhere else. Because Uniswap has the highest TVL of all the DEXs, they usually have the least amount of slippage. So many projects offering yield farming for Uniswap LPs.

Uniswap needs to implement an L2 solution, but beyond that, Uniswap is going to be hard to beat.

Derivatives: Synthetix. No other platform in on-chain derivatives has the dominance and adoption that Synthetix has. I they have so many assets you can go short/long on either through inverse/synthetic assets or true options in the OptionsDAO. 

Synthetix just upgraded to Optimistic Ethereum (L2 solution), and the gas fees are going to slowly diminish as OE is fully integrated into the platform. Just about every VC investing in DeFi has thrown money at Synthetix. There is so much room for further innovation here.

The 2021 Roadmap is so promising, and while there is a lot there, the team behind Synthetix ships upgrades like no ones business. 

Plus: by using Curve, there is literally no slippage when converting sUSD to any synthetic asset. That is a rare thing.

Insurance: Nexus Mutual or Armor.Fi.  While Armor.fi underwrites coverage through Nexus Mutual, Armor Fi doesn’t require KYC like Nexus Mutual does. You can stake wNXM on Armor Fi and earn rewards without having to go through a KYC process like you do to interact with the Nexus Mutual app. You can buy coverage through Armor Fi, too, without KYC.

By and far, Nexus Mutual is the dominant smart contract cover provider on Ethereum. In fact, there isn’t another platform that offers coverage like Nexus does. Hopefully Nexus can expand offerings this year and grow their active community through their work with Amor Fi.

These are my opinions, and I do think their are other platforms that we’ll see grow incredibly fast this year—like Alpha Finance Labs.

We’ll see who captures more market share as the year goes on.",2021-01-28 14:28:39

bananainbeijing,"Apologies for the long story, but I wanted to get this off my chest.

I went to Stern and studied finance and accounting, graduated in 2008. While I was there, I met some of the people that would go on to be successful on Wall Street. Here are some of the stories.

I had a ""friend"" that I got along with super well. We went on a short weekend trip with the class, and she and I walked around the hotel til 2 in the morning talking about our future and just random crap college students talk about. I thought we were good friends, you know? We were in one of the same classes. I was sick and missed a class, and I asked to borrow her notes for that day. She refused. Basically was like sucks for you. The class was graded on a curve. The lower test score I got, the better for her, and her chances of landing a prestigious finance job. Wasn't friends with her after that.

I had another friend who's roommate turned off her alarm for an 8am class. She overslept and missed an exam because of this. Similar reasons, class was graded on a curve.

And I knew a guy that was the epitome of douchebag. Narcissist, self indulging (though quite attractive), but was a bit of an asshole. He was good friends and roommates with a buddy of mine. Every time we got study notes and prior year exams, we would share them with everyone. Not this dude. Multiple times, he would get exams from his gf, and never share at all. He ended up interning at a bank, and later went to a hedge fund. I'm sure he fit right now. I've always wanted to say this, but fuck you D***. I never knew why we put up with your shit. Yes you prob make more money than me, but at least I have my morals and real friends. 

These are the types of people I dealt with at Stern, most of whom went on to Wall Street. Of course there were a lot of cool people, but most of them just weren't cut out for the Street. Most of the reasonable people I knew left after 1 - 5 years. If you have a heart and soul, Wall Street isn't the place for you.

The last thing I want to say is, fuck those guys. They don't give a shit about you, and will do anything to make a buck. I'm glad I never ended up there.",2021-01-28 17:18:11

BlackLeader70,"Well basically if you have enough margin from other stocks to cover the loss of another stock then you won’t get margin called. If your overall account goes negative they might force you to sell to cover part of the losses then bill you the rest. 

Personally I sold some profitable stocks on RH as part of a plan to divest from those cunts. So even though I’m negative on “stock 1” I have enough margin to cover that from selling “stock 2” 

But at the end of the day, you gotta do you...stocks, cryptos and finance in general do have a pretty sharp learning curve. Keep educating yourself and build on it!",2021-01-29 07:22:45
samdane7777," 

There is a overall trend within the power sphere and oligarchy that constitutes western countries and central banks. What Dwight D Eisenhower referred to could better now be described as a Military- Tech -Finance Industrial Complex. What started off as partisan deplatform absolutely will become whole sale deplatforming of the lower classes, it will absolutely be a Patriot Act 2.0, and this will all absolutely affect cryptocurrency.

Before I get into this, I want to say, I tried for nearly two years to post things about regulatory threats in the main reddit for bitcoin. They don't care about the overall effect of regulations on the whole space, even when it is an existential threat. They are dominated by underinformed under educated american who are largely toxic maximalist. It's not just unhealthy to the community it is becoming an existential threat because we need to be organized. That's what the Wallstreets Bet fiasco should teach you. And r  /   bitcoin banned me for 30 days, more or less for telling the truth. I lost my temper because for months on end I got horribly unconstructive dismissal of these regulatory threats. And then low and behold The Treasury Department with Mnuchin came out and did the very thing I said it would with its attempt to force KYC on personal cold storage wallets receiving deposits from CEX.

Look they have to find a way to keep us from competing with them and their fiat, they have to find a way to shut us down when they cannot stop the protocol level. I believe that way will be through proof of source of income and using chain analysis to strand your DeFi and overseas money out of the united states, to block deposits that come from ecosystems outside the bank and us regulator controlled centralized platforms by blocking people who cannot provide a chain of custody/source of income records.

And that is just in addition to censoring and deplatforming countless exchanges and assets.

Just build your own social media.

Just build your own server infrastructure.

Just build your own bank.

Just build your own internet.

Just build your own broker.

***Well, we have to, unironically, we have to build the full infrastructure stack.***

We have to set everything up like the piratebay with infinte mirrors, no single attack vector, distributed dns, server hosting, distribute and censorship proof the entire stack. The Federal Agencies and Banks will come for it hard. They will say only terrorists use it. **They will remove everything hosted on github. They have the legal precedent to go after developers now with the federal ruling against Helix. That was intentional to lay the groundwork for future attacks on DeFi.**

If you host it on github, you're screwed, if you doxx yourself as a developer, screwed, if you doxx the liquidity provider, screwed.

Right now, Sushiswap,Uniswap, Curve, Kyber, Ren, Thorchain, Solana, are just some of the beginning full onchain protocol level defi systems, this is just the beginning of what it will take to make this system battle proof.",2021-01-29 12:25:15
that_blockhead,"The three most common that I know of:

1. Interest paid from supplying liquidity to lending protocols, just like earning interest by lending money in traditional finance
2. Trading fees earned from pooling liquidity on an AMM (decentralized exchange like Uniswap, Sushi, Balancer etc)
3. Native-token APY from one of the above or staking - protocols like Compound, Curve and others reward one of the activities mentioned above with additional APY paid in their native token, as a bonus incentive and/or way to reward participants for using the protocols in the early stages. This is where most of the very high APYs come from, with the drawback that the native protocol token is usually highly inflationary (at least for a period of time until distribution is complete). But it's a way to distribute the token at least somewhat fairly, as it goes directly to users and those providing a necessary service at the early stages, much like Bitcoin mining - in fact it's often called liquidity mining. This is one of the reasons why it's a great time to get into DeFi while it's still early - at some point most of those protocol tokens will be fully distributed and the early adopters of successful DeFi protocols will have had the opportunity to accumulate positions in the future of finance while earning yield on their funds!",2021-01-29 15:06:18
Nzwiebach,"If you’re mad at wall street banks and hedge funds for what they did at the battle of GME, buy silver to hit them in the heart. SLV is the most shorted asset in the world. The gold to silver ratio is 70:1 it’s fundamentally more undervalued than it has been in the history of its use. It’s more utilized today than it has ever been. It’s price is suppressed for finance, and industry management. You pump SLV you crash the whole hedge fund system. A fair value for silver would be around $200 for the supply and demand curve it exists on. it’s ~25.00. A short squeeze would send it to $1000. The market cap is 1.4 trillion, but it is paper traded 100x the available material in the futures market, so it is significantly less. They also CANT shut it down. SLV is a tracker fund of the price of real silver. If they stop trading you can drive to a coin shop and buy the real stuff.

The math. There’s 4.3 million WSB users.
There’s ~55 billion ounces of physical silver believed to be in the world. (BUT! Silver isn’t recycled so it’s likely much less. Account for industrial consumption and global dispersion, there’s little to no real available trading silver. Bullion sites run out all the time.)
If the average WSB user is like the lower wage investor their median investment portfolio is around $10,000 but the national median is 130,000 so there’s some disparity. 
If all WSB users bought silver or SLV at an average account value of $15,000 they wouldn’t be able to buy it all. They would consume &gt;5% of the entire perceived silver market. WSB would hold more silver than the United States and China combined.",2021-01-29 17:57:18

NobleOps,"I’ve been taking 2 courses at a time. 

I paired 6203 with Simulation and that was a good workload over summer term. 

6040 also humbled me. I failed both midterms but got a 100% on the final and a B in the course with no prior python experience. (Paired with Finance class)

6203 is incredibly easy if you stick with it. 

For Sim if you do all the HWs and take a good notes sheet for the exams you’ll get a B as there is a great curve in that class. 

6040 is going to eat all your time and make the other two courses difficult to manage if you’re like me. 

I wouldn’t drop anything until near the deadline which should let you take midterms in 2/3 classes.",2021-01-29 23:42:09
More_than_Salvation,"&gt;People have raised similar concerns about global collapse due to energy starvation.  The ""peak oil""/Hubbert Curve craze was the first wave. It predicted depletion of world oil production and global collapse, but that idea has died in the face of hydraulic fracturing (""fracking"") techniques that actually boosted potential oil production.

The oil producer have to get in debt and the production of unconventional oil is not profitable. It is more environmentally damaging and polluting. The EROI is lower compared to conventional oil. It is also finite: there is concern that the peak of unconventional oil will reach around 2025 to 2030.

Also it has been shown that economical growth is dependent on the energy consumption of fossil fuel, especially oil.

How would you finance renewable energy or even manufacture or transport the renewable technologies after the peak is reached?",2021-01-30 03:24:40
disruptthenorm,"So I think it depends on the kind of finance you want. PM or technical lead in fin tech is absolutely possible but I’d question need an MBA to be a tech lead (definitely need it for PM)

Truthfully have no clue what a Tech Lead in PE/VC is, but for those roles, particularly for PE you’re going to need pre-MBA IB or PE experience. The learning curve and risk is too high to take anyone without it. For buyside also the M7 you go to will play a huge role. HBS, Booth, CBS, and Wharton punch above their weight for PE while others have it but it’s more networking and less of the “sexy” funds.

Which M7 schools are you interviewing with? Posters here can give you a better view once they know what your potential options are",2021-01-30 06:42:33
FreeKhajiit,"Investopedia and Youtube are your friends, G. Specific channels that have helped me (and I still don't know jack shit really) are InTheMoney, Kamikaze Cash and trading Trading Fraternity. That's just me giving you the bare tip. Hehehe. 

As for brokers, screw Stash. I would say Robinhood six months ago but....holy fuck no. NO!!!!! I'd rather you stick with Stash. I'm dropping RH right after GME is over and I can cash out.

TD Ameritrade is pretty solid for info, stats and all that. The Think or Swim platform, while I'm still doing plenty of messing around with it, and has a steep learning curve, is pretty much top notch in its category from what I'm aware. You can even actually *call* TDA and have their reps sit down with you and give you tutorials on what goes where (hint pp goes *into* vajayjay, make sure you tell your customer service rep that).

Of course TDA is my more 'serious' broker (soon to be only), so I'm probably a bit biased. One drawback I just discovered is that it rejects limit orders above the current price by a certain spread (so if it's going for 350, you can't place a limit sell for 1,000). Usually not a huge problem but.....obviously you never know. So I'll probably start shopping around too. 

Plenty of other decent commission free options like Etrade and Webull (though I distrust any Chinese company tbh), Vanguard, Schwab and Fidelity. Though you may have to save to a certain amount before you can bat for. Feel free to shop around for what works best for you. Read reviews, ask around on the subreddits and shit. You know.

As for subs, fuck r/investing unless you think 3% annual returns are good. Which I mean....ok Boomer, whatever works for you. 

If that's the case, and I won't kink shame you for liking to watch turtles get freaky, you want to look at boring shit like ETFs, Mutual Funds, and other crap like that (basically buying into a bundle of stuff, whether a certain market, idea, or just *the market itself,* instead of one security). That sort of thing, as well as bonds and CDs and whatnot, are more about keeping your money with small and steady gains rather than making it hand over fist. For the latter you want to look at options or Forex (foreign exchange markets), both of which require some balls of 💎 but there are strategies for steady gains (in theory) and you can leverage a comparatively small amount of money to make a solid bit more. Or watch it all turn to a pile of shit in front of your very eyes. Just be careful with that because unlike buying stocks you *can* go below zero if you fuck up in certain ways (generally your broker will have to review your application to be this stupid and allow it), and that is not a spot you want to be. 

More specific stuff like r/options, r/stocks, r/daytrading, and my favorite homo homeboys over at r/thetagang (which has its own website that's pretty legit) can all be good if you're willing to sift through some garbage. 

As for this sub, my dude. This is legalized gambling. It started off as a bunch of yuppie finance dorks who all had an extra 70k laying around to do dumb shit with. Sometimes someone would strike the fuck out. Sometimes while literally having no clue how they did it. Sometimes there's actually genuine insight and a smart move or two. 90% of that probably isn't what you'll read. I'd hang around for the memes and loss porn, maybe try your hand at some of the fuckery they suggest, but take almost all of what you read here with a table shaker of salt.",2021-01-30 11:38:18

mist3rflibble,"Not sure what you’d consider “cheap” but the MPC Live or MPC One would be excellent for you. I have a Live and am a huge fanboi. I think the uplift in price is worth it versus the MPC One. Comparison here. 

https://www.mpc-tutor.com/mpc-one-preview/

With most online music retailers you can finance a MPC Live for two years interest free and it’ll cost you less than a decent iPhone. :) The great thing about the MPC Live is that you get the MPC software DAW included so if you have certain things you’d rather do in a computer then you have the option. But as a MPC Live owner I can tell you that won’t be very often - the device is great. Learning curve is steep at first, but you can greatly flatten that by watching TubeDigga YouTube videos and buying the MPC Bible. 

Check out the workflow here, this should give you a good solid idea. This is a 4-part series but well worth watching before you part with your cash.

toombak,"The good thing would be to spend some considerable time learn what Yearn Finance + Sushi Swap, Aave, Curve, Compound, Maker, Alpha Homora, Hegic, Graph Protocol, Chainlink, Loopring, Optimism, Synthetix and the like are trying to achieve as almost interchangable actors within a primordial soup like ecosystem within DeFi that is but a single feature of the larger Ethereum network. Then, the rest comes, and in the mean time, you inadvertently learn how to trade in the best possible way.

Yes, gas spikes due to network congestion, which means it is favored by many people. I am a very small player, but I can attest that it was only possibly through paying the cost of opportunity (gas) that I could profit on the midterm.

Btw, look into gas mechanics. It is always possible to pay around %30 less even after you sign the transaction. 

...and, learning the complicated details help you in the long term rather than using kinda centralized apps on ethereum. Plus, there is considerable amount of airdrops every now and then just because you make a transaction on a given platform.

I am also subscribed to the likes of Bankless newsletter. Reading some newsletters like The Daily Gwei, Defi Dad, Decentralise, Our Network etc. helped me a lot.",2021-01-30 23:16:51
