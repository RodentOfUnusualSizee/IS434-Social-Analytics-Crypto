I'm sorry in advance if the question is silly, I'm quite a noob to DAI ecosystem, but is there any single reason for an individual to borrow DAI at all, except supporting the global collateral?
I mean, by borrowing DAI you leave out a significant portion of your portfolio locked away from you (as collateral is bigger than the actual DAI you can redeem), you're even more dependent on volatility as now your collateral can also be liquidated with a fee, and you can easily get the same DAI on an exchange with none of these problems.
So, is this a thing for enthusiasts or is there something I'm missing out?"

I took out a DAI loan of say maybe $30,000

Suppose ETH crashed and hit whatever liquidation threshold,

Liquidators would bid for my ETH and they would purchase my ETH in the collateral and pay using DAI 

So my ETH disappears to the buyer and MakerDAO receives some DAI which is then immediately burned 

What happens to the 30k DAI that I am currently holding?

It does not match up since the buyer has repaid my loans by buying my collaterals

But I still have 30,000 DAI?"

Delegation is live in MakerDAO!,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/ox27xn/delegation_is_live_in_makerdao/,LongForWisdom,1,2021-08-03 20:15:13,29,/r/MakerDAO/comments/ox27xn/delegation_is_live_in_makerdao/,NaN,"Delegation has now been launched for the Maker Protocol. If you hold MKR and haven't been voting in the past, please give serious consideration to delegating your MKR to one or more of Maker's Recognised Delegates.

**Ineffective or participation-starved governance will kill the Maker Protocol over the long-term just as surely as governance attacks will in the short term.**

If you are holding capital in the MKR Token you should seriously consider delegating responsibly. The safest and lowest-effort way of doing this is to split your MKR across the Recognised Delegates. Alternatively, taking a little more time and determining which delegate you prefer is also advisable.  

**Here are a couple of highlights:**

* Each Recognised Delegate has a public profile that describes their values and plans for the Maker Protocol.
* You can split your MKR across different delegates.
* Delegation contracts expire after one year, so plan to check in on occasion. 
* You can also delegate to one of the Shadow Delegates, but this is more risky and there are less guarantees as to delegate consistency and performance. 

**Here are some recommended considerations (taken from the MKR Holder's Guide to Delegation.)**

* **Trust**  
Delegation is an expression of trust of the MKR Holder in the delegate.
* **Incentives**  
Examine your delegate’s incentives, these are not solely monetary, these are not always permanent.
* **Recognition**  
Recognised Delegates are safer than Shadow Delegates (but not by much).
* **Balance**  
Be aware of the checks on power among delegates and Core Units. Having only a few large delegates is a risk. Delegation to Core Unit personnel is not advised by GovAlpha.
* **Cost-Benefit**  
Responsible Voting &gt; Responsible Delegation &gt; Apathy &gt; Irresponsible Voting &gt; Irresponsible Delegation. Responsible delegation is much, much cheaper than responsible voting and almost as good

**And here are several resources:**

* [The Recognised Delegates Code of Conduct](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/recognised-delegate-code-of-conduct/9384) \- The Recognised Delegates are required to meet these criteria. 
* [The Token Holder's Delegation Agreement](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/token-holders-delegation-agreement/9385) \- Describes the holder-delegate relationship from the PoV of the Holder.
* [The MKR Holders Guide to Delegation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mkr-holder-s-guide-to-delegation/9602) \- Describes the risks and considerations that should be understood by MKR Holders prior to delegating their MKR.

Is there a weighting between these two factor's or and I completely misunderstanding things?

I’m a bit puzzled by something and hoping you can help clear it up for me;

We all know the only way to mint 100 Dai is by locking up assets in the Maker Protocol, but to unlock those assets again I need to buy extra Dai on top of that 100 on the open market. 

But at the beginning, surely there must have been more Dai than that which was minted from the Protocol? So people could buy enough to pay back the interest? How was this extra Dai accounted for if it wasn’t backed by assets? 

Many thanks!"

Is the Peg Stability Module actually used? How does DAI maintain its price of $1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/p7x9z5/is_the_peg_stability_module_actually_used_how/,karna852,1,2021-08-20 15:23:28,9,/r/MakerDAO/comments/p7x9z5/is_the_peg_stability_module_actually_used_how/,NaN,"It's quite confusing - I don't understand what are all of the mechanisms that allows DAI to remain at $1. Please don't just point me to the docs or the white paper - I have read both and attempted to understand both.

As far as I can tell here are the mechanisms (I am talking about Multicollateral DAI, not SAI).

1. Interest rates. MKR owners can vote to set the savings rate and the interest rate charged for borrowers. A higher savings rate causes more DAI to come into vaults, lowering DAI supply and hopefully increasing price. A lower interest rate for borrowing, makes borrowing cheaper, encouraging borrowing and increasing the amount of DAI in circulation, raising the supply and lowering price. 
2. Auctions. Suppose the cause of DAI being &lt; $1 is due to a fall in the general crypto market and is accompanied by falls in the price of BAT and ETH (which, apart from USDC, also account for collateral put up for a loan). When the price falls so much that there is not enough collateral to justify the loan, an auction is created in which people can use DAI to buy that collateral at a discounted rate. Therefore they lock up DAI in exchange for buying that collateral. 
   1. Suppose the cause of DAI being &gt; $1 is due to increased demand for DAI. We want to issue more DAI in order to expand supply. This is correlated with having more DAI with MKR. MKR holders (who are incentivized because they govern the DAI token and if they burn MKR, the price of MKR will rise), use their MKR tokens to buy DAI and release it into the market. This causes the supply of DAI to go up, lowering the price.
   2. If nobody wants to buy the collateral, people who want to own MKR, use DAI to pay for the outstanding debt and are issued MKR tokens in return. This restricts the DAI supply and also punishes MKR owners by reducing the price of MKR.
3. Market Maker Keepers --&gt; I seriously don't think I understand this, and the docs are absolutely terrible.
   1.  I \*think\* these are bots that will offer to buy/sell DAI within a set of defined prices (called bands). 
   2. I \*do not understand\* how they actually cause the price of DAI to move back to $1.
   3. You might be smarter than I - if you can understand this - [https://github.com/makerdao/market-maker-keeper](https://github.com/makerdao/market-maker-keeper), please explain it to me. 
4. Arbitrage
   1. If the price of DAI is &lt; $1 and I expect it to return to $1. I am incentivized to buy DAI at below $1 and wait for it to rise to $1. I can make risk free profit here.
   2. I don't understand how Arbitrage helps if DAI is &gt; $1. 
5. Emergency Shutdown.
   1. In this case, something bad has really happened. The system stops allowing new vaults to be created and stops issuing new DAI. Instead, everyone who holds DAI gets back a part of the total collateral in the system (so everything deposited + everything stored from the stability fees). 
   2. **Not sure how this maintains day to day peg stability, or how it maintains stability in the event that there's a large loss of confidence in all collateral types.** 

***Questions***

1. How do market maker keeper bots help with keeping the price at $1?
2. Do arbitrage bots have a place in Multicollateral DAI, or are they deprecated?
3. What is the role of the Peg Stability Module? I asked on the DAI chat and someone said ""Yes - arbitraging, mainly using the Peg Stability Module is very much still relevant."", but I can't find any indication of its use in the docs or in Github.
4. How does the Emergency Shutdown mechanism help maintain the price at $1?

I'm in the middle of a deep dive into DAI and trying to simplify a lot of the language so that people can understand what is going on.

I intend to release this freely and publicly.

Any help would be great!

Thanks!"

What will this project do when USD crashes and becomes worthless? Have dai crash with it or move to something else? A stable coin isn't really stable when pegged to fiat anyway. If you don't agree with the first part just pretend it's a hypothetical :)"

[Maker](https://sevenb.io/currencies/maker) (MKR) – is a decentralized open source platform, the main goal of which is to create decentralized stablecoins. The platform operates on the basis of the Ethereum blockchain and has two tokens: the DAI stablecoin and the MKR token. Since the project operates on the Ethereum blockchain, it has the same consensus mechanism – Proof-of-Work.

MKR organizes the management and operation of the Maker ecosystem, fixes the cost of the stablecoin DAI and acts as a tool for attracting investors. The DAI stablecoin provides a unique approach to ensuring a stable price. DAI depends on a system of smart contracts with Collateralized Debt Position (CDP), supported by ETH, to maintain its price in equilibrium. That is, each token is backed by a certain asset, which the client borrows from the system, and then gives back. Thus, the Maker project solves the problem that Tether is sinning – it is simply impossible to issue tokens uncontrollably on the platform. And this is also one of the reasons why the MKR token was created, because “fuel” is needed for the platform to function. Further in the review we will describe the main functions of the MKR token.

## Why should I trade Maker? 

The key reasons for trading MKR are:

* DAI is one of the most popular stablecoins on the crypto market. In turn, the DAI rate is completely dependent on MKR. Along with the high demand and extremely limited emission of only 1,000,000 coins the price of MKR will only grow.
* In 2021, investors’ interest in the Maker platform increased significantly. MKR is one of those cryptocurrencies that have updated the maximum price of January 2018. At that time the price reached $1690, on May 3, 2021, the coin price was $6,012, i.e. almost 3.5 times more. Analysts’ forecasts are extremely optimistic, for example, DigitalCoin predicts growth to $5,477 by the end of 2021, and $11,155 by 2025.

As of August 17, 2021, the price of MKR is approximately $3,742, with a market capitalization of $3,712,812,337. The minimum price as of January 30, 2017 was $21.06, since then the coin has risen by 17,634%.

### What to know before exchanging Maker? 

Anyone who wants to exchange any cryptocurrency, probably wants to do it as safely, faster, and profitable as possible. To do this, you need to follow a number of recommendations:

1. Make sure that you have chosen a platform with a good reputation. You can use the monitoring services as BestChange.
2. Make sure that you are aware of the fees charged. You can find information about them on the platform’s website in the FAQ section.
3. Make sure that you entered the recipient’s address correctly. An incorrect address will lead to the loss of your funds.

## Maker token use cases 

MKR use cases:

* With MKR coins users pay fees for transactions and the redemption of collateral.
* MKR holders can play a crucial role in managing the Maker platform. Depending on the amount of coins held, the stakeholder can make important decisions, offer improvements, vote, and more.
* MKR plays a crucial role in ensuring the stable value of the DAI coin. The DAI rate fluctuates in the range of only 5%.
