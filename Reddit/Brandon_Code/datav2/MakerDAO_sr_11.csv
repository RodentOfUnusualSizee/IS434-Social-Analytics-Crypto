WSTETH-A Vaults support is now live at DeFi Saver,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/qkapie/wstetha_vaults_support_is_now_live_at_defi_saver/,nikola_j,1,2021-11-01 18:04:06,6,/r/MakerDAO/comments/qkapie/wstetha_vaults_support_is_now_live_at_defi_saver/,NaN,"Hey, all!

Wanted to share that the WSTETH-A Vaults are live at DeFi Saver. [wstETH](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/wsteth/) is the wrapped version of stETH, Lido's liquid ETH staking token and this new Maker Vault type was voted in [last week](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-parameter-changes-wsteth-a-onboarding-october-22-2021?network=mainnet#proposal-detail).

We actually released this a few days ago, on Friday, but thought maybe some people are more likely to see an announcement here rather than on twitter.

Our support for WSTETH-A Vaults includes the options to:

* Create Vaults (borrow against wstETH)
* Create an instantly leveraged position/Vault (e.g. long ETH, but using wstETH instead)
* Convert any ETH-x Vault into WSTETH-A
* Automate WSTETH-A Vaults (so you can setup liquidation protection or automated leveraging)

We shared a bit about all of these in our [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/DeFiSaver/status/1454159904651026444), but I'll gladly provide any more info and answer any questions in this thread, so please go ahead and @ me with anything!

For anyone looking to check or try any of these options, note that we also have a *Simulation mode* available in DeFi Saver, where you can either create a blank account with 100 ETH in credits or simulate your existing account to try out an ETH-A to WSTETH-A shift, for example, without having to commit any actual funds right away.

You can check out any of this at [https://app.defisaver.com/](https://app.defisaver.com/).

I've made a video of one of the most important things to understand in DEFI, Dexes, and crypto in general, **Liquidity!**

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_vsg8P9Gq-0**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vsg8P9Gq-0)

In the video, I will explain what is liquidity with a lot of examples and I will simplify it for you so you can level up your DEFI understanding.

We will look at the biggest decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) which is PancakeSwap - in order to understand what it is.

The information in the video applies to any other DEX on any other blockchain (It works the same).

Liquidity is one of the most important things in decentralized exchanges and without it, the DEX's actually doesn't worth anything.

The more liquidity decentralized exchanges have, the better prices the users are going to pay when swapping tokens and they will suffer less from price impact and slippage.

That's why most of the decentralized exchanges are ""fighting"" for liquidity by offering Yield Farm and Staking programs.

Basically, the war is between blockchains and decentralized exchanges, the one with the most amount of liquidity wins.

Imagine a decentralized exchange like a robot that holds tokens in pairs (for example Cake-BNB). 

The robot in our story is a smart contract that it's is to preserve the same amount of BNB and Cake in the reserves. 

Anytime someone is buying or selling cake to the contract (robot) he changes the balance and therefore the contract is giving the user a ""worse price"" for the swap (Slippage).

The bigger the swap, the bigger the slippage is gonna be. The more liquidity the ""robot"" has, the lower the slippage will be.

In this video, I am going to explain to you all these kinds of concepts in an easy way, so after watching the video you will finally understand what does liquidity means on decentralized exchanges and why it's so important.

Hope you like it, and lemme know if you have any questions.

Johnny."

Seems like I can't use my trezor 1 with metamask on Defisavor or Oasis at the moment unless I use the legacy oasis site. 

Error message shows its because I am trying to do an EIP 1559 transaction but my current network doesn't support it. 

I was able to use my Trezor until recently without any issues.

Any idea when this might be resolved or if there is a fix out there now? Specifically I would rather use DefiSavor over Oasis."

   The goal of SafeShiba is simple, reward holders. We might have a memecoin name, but we have the best tokenomics in the game. We are a fair launched and 100% transparent project that are always putting community in front of everything else.

 Our Tokenomics are as follows:

 \- 2% BTC Buyback - 2% of every transaction will be used to purchase BTC to help back the SAFESHIB token and create a floor price. Once our lending app launches, token holders will be able to borrow BTC against their SAFESHIB at 0% APY

 \- 2% Dev/Marketing/Buyback Fee - 2% of every transaction will be used to support development efforts along with buybacks, burns and marketing to help show the world our project

 \- 1% Burn - 1% of every Transaction is burned to help remove supply from the system and create a supply shock. This further helps our holders benefit

   Roadmap: To make sure we always deliver cutting edge tokenomics and features to our holders, we've devised the following roadmap:

 Lending App (Q1 2022) - This is the pinnacle of our Tokenomics, 0% APY BTC borrowing against SAFESHIB. 

 DEX (Coming Q2 2022) - A state of the art DEX that will provide yield farming opportunities and additional ways for SAFESHIB to increase in value

NFTs (Coming Q4 2022) - Revolutionary NFT's that let you dive into the metaverse and experience Web 3.0. And of course, even more ways to spread value to SAFESHIB holders.

 CEX Listings - Tier 1 Exchanges are planned for 2022 and we promise to deliver big. This will help spread the word of SAFESHIB massively.

 Alongside all of this we will be hosting weekly competitions, buybacks, surprise announcements and much more."

I sent my Dai from Coinbase to my Metamask wallet. I then tried to send my Dai somewhere else and found out that the cost to send it from my Metamask wallet cost as much as my total holdings of DAI.

Ex. I hold 1,000 DAI($1k) and gas fee to send from Metamask costs a little under .2 ETH($1k).

Is there any way around this? Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you!!"

Did it just start off this way, where DAI was always used for liquidations/collateral auctions, and that DAI was only extracted from a Keeper locking in their ETH onto a vault?"

Layer 2’s are currently a hot topic in DeFi, and the PE team has created a way to transfer and mint Dai on L2s as well as other L1 blockchains.

Users can currently transfer Dai between Arbitrum, Optimism, and the Ethereum mainnet. In the coming months, new L2s will be added and minting will become available on networks that have deployed multi-collateral Dai.

&amp;#x200B;

Lending App (Q1 2022) - This is the pinnacle of our Tokenomics, 0% APY BTC borrowing against SAFESHIB. 

&amp;#x200B;

DEX (Coming Q2 2022) - A state of the art DEX that will provide yield farming opportunities and additional ways for SAFESHIB to increase in value

&amp;#x200B;

NFTs (Coming Q4 2022) - Revolutionary NFT's that let you dive into the metaverse and experience Web 3.0. And of course, even more ways to spread value to SAFESHIB holders.

&amp;#x200B;

CEX Listings - Tier 1 Exchanges are planned for 2022 and we promise to deliver big. This will help spread the word of SAFESHIB massively.

&amp;#x200B;

Alongside all of this we will be hosting weekly competitions, buybacks, surprise announcements and much more."

Cheapest way to send Dai to vault?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/qujyae/cheapest_way_to_send_dai_to_vault/,pgarrity18,1,2021-11-16 00:14:45,6,/r/MakerDAO/comments/qujyae/cheapest_way_to_send_dai_to_vault/,NaN,"I am in the U.S. and I am considering opening a vault and taking out a Dai loan using ETH as collateral.

On Coinbase Pro I can purchase Dai at the market price with a 0.01% Taker Fee. Does it make sense to then send directly to the vault address from Coinbase Pro? Are there any smart contract related issues that suggest I should send to a private wallet first? If so, that is getting expensive if I am to pay this back monthly.

What is the best way to pay back a loan and minimize costs? I understand the tradeoff between a monthly payment and a quarterly or yearly payment (less network fees, but higher risk of triggering liquidation). I am trying to evaluate the best approach and I am curious how others make regular payments from USD -&gt; Dai -&gt; Vault. I do not see an L2 solution for this yet but maybe I am missing something?"

Pros: ""Green bonds are mostly backed by the full balance sheet of the issuer, and not only by the cash flows related to the climate-friendly project financed from the proceeds"" ([page 56](https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1909f.pdf)). They also provide the benefits of diversification.

Cons: The returns of some of these ETFs [have been pretty low](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/grnb/) imo. 

In general, I think they would be pretty safe from wild price fluctuations and they would provide investment in clean energy. but I'm not sure that they would provide enough yield. What do you guys think?"

Their token will be used to regulate financial transactions between customers and freelancers. Investors and token holders can earn on staking. Plus, there are some ways to earn on token sale or pre-sale. (Waiting list registration started at - [https://token.wono.io/](https://token.wono.io/)).

They promise to post a series of articles, explaining the work of token and how to earn on it.   
So, here's why invest in Wono:   
1) Idea. The token will be used as a payment between employers and freelancers. It's based on smart-contracts and aims to avoid fraud and scam in freelancing. Just to add, in 2021, out of 3.6 billion people's global workforce, 1.1 are [freelancers](https://www.ccn.com/38-of-freelancers-regularly-use-cryptocurrency-survey-reveals/). I guess, you see the potential.   
2) [**Huobi**](https://www.huobi.com/en-us/) **support**. The project is supported by Huobi exchange. It's the third cryptocurrency exchange in the world after [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) and [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/). All users would be able to stake and exchange tokens on Huobi via a special crypto-wallet.    
3) Fast-growing [community](https://www.facebook.com/wonoworld/). For now, Wono.io is a freelance exchange for people mostly from Asia and Africa. It already has 518,000+ registered users from which 8,000+ are already paying for the subscription services. The Wono monthly turnover is $127,520. Average profit from one paying user: $15,94.  
   Of course, it's up to you to decide whether to invest in the Wono project or not, but you can see its advantages and potential. IDO's coming at the end of November."

Maker Delegate GFX Labs Would Like Your Vote!,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/qxhjok/maker_delegate_gfx_labs_would_like_your_vote/,PaperImperium,1,2021-11-19 22:38:08,13,/r/MakerDAO/comments/qxhjok/maker_delegate_gfx_labs_would_like_your_vote/,NaN,"Many of you know me as PaperImperium, one of the original slate of delegates at MakerDAO. I have now transitioned to help build the GFX Labs governance team, which means starting over with a new delegation contract. [I am here to ask for your delegated MKR votes!](https://vote.makerdao.com/delegates?network=mainnet)

Please feel free to ask any questions in the comments, but here are three common ones to get us started:

**Why did you switch to work for GFX Labs instead of remaining a solo delegate?**  
One of the continuing problems at Maker is that votes are increasingly complex and nuanced. Delegates have consistently not had access to expertise on a number of topics. One of the most glaring is that Maker has no legal expertise in-house to guide delegates. Without any formal legal advice on contentious topics such as the recent vote to integrate Deco Protocol into Maker, delegates were forced to seek out informal opinions from a variety of sources -- former SEC attorneys, crypto-specific counsel intimately familiar with Maker, and general personal attorneys. Being part of GFX Labs ensures that I and my colleagues who cover other protocols for GFX have access to professional legal, economic, and technical expertise to avoid potentially catastrophic mistakes when delegates are left to Google their way to whether something presents legal, economic, or technical risk to Maker. I firmly believe over time most delegates on large protocols will be part of teams that can provision professional resources -- GFX Labs and Gauntlet are likely the first two of many.

**What is your stance on burning?**  
The buy-and-burn mechanic is core to Maker's value proposition. While it is normally good policy to avoid buybacks when a business is in a growth stage, Maker has the unique quality of being able to source capital extremely cheaply without the need for dilution. Because of its unique position of being systemically important to the DeFi ecosystem, Maker does have a responsibility to maintain adequate reserves in the Surplus Buffer to cover at least a year of (rapidly growing) contributor expenses and cover any bad debt that may be liquidated at a loss. However, having at least a small burn ongoing at all times not only offsets the (rapidly growing) obligations to vest MKR alongside (rapidly growing) contributor salary expenses, but it also ensures there is a healthy ecosystem of keepers to sell MKR to burn at reasonable prices. 

**What can you do to add value to Maker?**  
For those unfamiliar with me, I regularly interface with US and international regulators, lawmakers, and traditional finance actors. This includes but is not limited to education efforts with our harshest critics like Senator Warren's advisors, providing industry understanding to regulators such as the CFPB, and negotiating a central role for Maker in financing the government-issued, tokenized bonds.\* With the addition of my personal relationships to the resources and expertise in governance services already in GFX Labs, I fully expect that there is much more value to deliver than passively voting on polls.

\*This agreement is subject to approval by Powell, Legarde, and host central banks. Decision whether or not to green light this program is expected by the end of December 2021.

**I encourage you to delegate a portion of your MKR to GFX Labs' delegate contract to best provide an advocate for a Maker that can grow and flourish for years to come. The delegation UI** [is here](https://vote.makerdao.com/delegates?network=mainnet)**. Information specific to GFX Labs** [can be found here](https://vote.makerdao.com/address/0xf60d7a62c98f65480725255e831de531efe3fe14?network=mainnet#delegate-credentials)**.

Not convinced yet? Read on!

   At 4.5M marketcap, a strong contract and an audit on the way, we can expect huge growth in the near future, many have already recouped initial investment in Polkadot reflections! If you’re the kind of guy that buys real tokens and not just meme coins, this is the project for you! The standard for pay-back tokens so far is flawed, with pay-back in the same token, taxes for all affect the price the same, redistributed taxes re-enter the market and cause drops. Which is why reflective tokens have become so popular in the past months. Taxes are applied in every transaction, which in turn purchase and drop a separate high value token to all holders with affecting the value of the original, giving passive income in stable high-marketap projects. For this reason and many other, InfinityDOT is a promising token, at the height of the bullrun, in a moment in which all chains are filled by meme-coins with no porpose that die within days, we have new token that provides actual value, and like it’s precedesor reflective tokens, it’s here to stay. As opposed to coins such as EverETH, or InfinityADA, InfinityDOT provides it’s reflection in Polkadot, a self-named etherum killer that has grown into a top 10 Marketcap coin with extremely dedicated development, community and an indisputable bright future ahead. Here comes InfinityDOT, while new tokens on Polkadot are still few in comparasion to the giants that are the Binance Smart Chain and Etherum, work for it’s future can start off-chain, with reflective tokens. InfinityDOT not only proposes as an investment opportunity it’s possible growth, but also the certain growth of a stable future token with a long history on the market. A future of the InfinityDOT token on it’s father chain that is BSC and a promising future on the parachain of Polkadot! The token has much work to do, the concept is promising, yet simple for anyone to understand, and compared to the majority of BSC Tokens, has a high survival chance. The team has just started going public, with a possible pre-sale to raise liquidity this week, a sale on DxSale to raise trust trough locked liquidity, a public open source contract to prove it’s security, and a perfect moment for a real project to start, in a sea of short-lived meme tokens, a real project is a real needle in a haystack. Of course DYOR, the project has barely started and has a long life ahead, the website is up and the contract will be published shortly, all we can do now is wait and verify it’s validity when the contract is published. Now that I’ve spoonfeed you, start DYOR, whitepaper, roadmap and community channels available at [www.InfinityDOT.net](http://www.infinitydot.net/)."

I have a bunch of questions about MakerDAO that I haven't really had success answering from the docs and was hoping someone here may have made a nicer, more friendly guide.

1) What happens when the value of collateral decreases? Both when it decreases but is still over collateralised (100% &lt; x &lt; 150%) and when it becomes under collateralised (x &lt; 100%)

2) At what point does a Keeper step in and sell the vault to prevent further loss?

3) How does MakerDAO prevent bad actors? Say ETH tanks and the vault is now under collateralised. If the actor never comes back and makes away - what happens?"

A future of the InfinityDOT token on it’s father chain that is BSC and a promising future on the parachain of Polkadot! The token has much work to do, the concept is promising, yet simple for anyone to understand, and compared to the majority of BSC Tokens, has a high survival chance. The team has just started going public, with a possible pre-sale to raise liquidity this week, a sale on DxSale to raise trust trough locked liquidity, a public open source contract to prove it’s security, and a perfect moment for a real project to start, in a sea of short-lived meme tokens, a real project is a real needle in a haystack. Of course DYOR, the project has barely started and has a long life ahead, the website is up and the contract will be published shortly, all we can do now is wait and verify it’s validity when the contract is published. Now that I’ve spoonfeed you, start DYOR, whitepaper, roadmap and community channels available at [www.InfinityDOT.net](http://www.infinitydot.net/)."

Can't combine types of collateral?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/r2e60m/cant_combine_types_of_collateral/,After-Cell,1,2021-11-26 11:52:51,6,/r/MakerDAO/comments/r2e60m/cant_combine_types_of_collateral/,NaN,"Just to confirm, reading this article ([https://decrypt.co/23027/makerdao-what-went-wrong-and-how-it-was-fixed](https://decrypt.co/23027/makerdao-what-went-wrong-and-how-it-was-fixed)), it's only possible to stable DAI by linking either to a particular coin? It's not a basket of currencies? 

I guess diversifying across types of collateral could be emulated by splitting a fund across different coins... but that would raise risk. 

Can anyone confirm this for me?"

Why half of the burning is not paid in DAI to MKR hodlers as a dividend and the other half is used to buy MKR and burn it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/r2giwb/why_half_of_the_burning_is_not_paid_in_dai_to_mkr/,TezosWakenBake,1,2021-11-26 14:13:10,22,/r/MakerDAO/comments/r2giwb/why_half_of_the_burning_is_not_paid_in_dai_to_mkr/,NaN,Investor likes the idea of 50% paid as dividend and 50% burned. It is way more attractive than the 100% burned option. An asset that pays a dividend in a different and more liquid asset is considered something of greater value versus an asset that is just being scarce.

Request For Input: Where To Notify Users When Collateral Is Offboarded?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/r2sjob/request_for_input_where_to_notify_users_when/,PaperImperium,1,2021-11-27 01:38:03,18,/r/MakerDAO/comments/r2sjob/request_for_input_where_to_notify_users_when/,NaN,"Hello, MakerDAO community. Over the last few weeks, quite a few smaller collateral types (AAVE, COMP, BAL, ZRX, LRC, various UNI LP tokens, etc) have been off boarded due to failure to justify their oracle costs.

Unfortunately, I have heard *several times* from vault users who were liquidated without even understanding why. This represents a poor user experience, obviously, and potentially exposes users to unexpected taxable events or even losses if a leveraged position is forcefully liquidated.

While offboarding small, unprofitable, thinly used vault types is still the correct business decision, I support taking every reasonable step to mitigate vault users from being unexpectedly left with unsupported vault smart contracts.

**My question to you: What channels do you use that would alert you to a change like this (aside from the MakerDAO Forum and this subreddit)?** Feel free to include communication channels that are both affiliated and unaffiliated with MakerDAO.

Thank you."

I'm calling no burns until we hit 90m...

But this Deco thing is a bit ridiculous to me. I read the forums about the proposal and so many good questions and counterpoints are made and reasons why we shouldn't be paying this much.. and yet here it is, exactly as proposed with no answer to the forums questions.

Did we find out about if revenue sharing comp structure will cause issues with the SEC?

Did we attempt to negotiate the deal? (sounded like we had ALL of the leverage as they already did the work and needed us while we didn't need them)

Did we test the market to see if 5.3m could buy a better product?

Weren't estimates for fixed rate borrowers low? When are we expected to break even on this 5m?


Overall, not happy with mkr governance deal making. Jamie Diamond is not making this deal. Could be a reason mkr fails in the long run."
