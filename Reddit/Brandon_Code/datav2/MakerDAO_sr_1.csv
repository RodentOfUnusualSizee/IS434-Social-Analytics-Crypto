I have a question that might be simple to some but I can't find easily an answer to.

In the day I decide to sell some BTC I will not want to exchange it to USDT / USDC because they are centrelized and can freeze wallets on demand. Also I don't like using centrelized exchanges hoping each time that on withdraw request they will ""allow me"" to get my own coins out without million questions or additional beurocracy. 
So, my main q is if  there's a decentrelized, fast way to turn BTC into DAI without unrequired headaches? If so, how?

Thank you"

As it currently stands the ether ceiling wont be raised for 2 days which is an eternity in this market! then when it is raised in will only be raised 150 million: with all the pent up demand that could be gobbled up in less than 24 hours. This is making human governance look not ideal (in the case of ether anyway) and so maybe its time to take decision making out of the process and raise the roof"

\- Are the tokens going to be valid/redeemable into new tokens when they arrive in my Binance wallet, or are they lost now?

\- Why is the transaction taking so long? Does it have something to do with EtherDelta not being in use any more, or the fact that they're old tokens? Will it go through if I wait long enough?"

What happens if DAI loses it's peg and goes to $2 for example?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/kt403z/what_happens_if_dai_loses_its_peg_and_goes_to_2/,TheCurious0ne,1,2021-01-08 22:56:06,9,/r/MakerDAO/comments/kt403z/what_happens_if_dai_loses_its_peg_and_goes_to_2/,NaN,"So, please bare with me and imagine this scenario.

At 15th Jan, NYAG decided Tether is fraud and/or Tether is unbacked throwing the full power of the US government against it.

Tether obviously loses it's peg and starts racing to $0, that wouldn't be huge deal but it's in every DEX AMM pool with other stables 

So let's make this simple example

in AMM DAI/USDT pool, USDT goes to 0 and DAI goes to $2

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly people that have borrowed $300 worth of DAI against $1000 worth of ETH (at relatively safe margin level of 300%+)

Owe $600 instead of $300.

At the same time other with riskier margin levels get liquadated and ETH price dumps as well, causing even the safe guy above being under collaterized with $600 worth of DAI against $100 worth of ETH (if ETH drops 90%)

&amp;#x200B;

Wouldn't that crash the whole system? And not just makerdao of course but pretty much everything?

I realize this is unconfirmed black swan FUD at this point, but black swans do happen from time to time and I just woud like to know if the above scenario is ralistic if that does happen, your thoughts?"

What if we could print different global currencies, like EUR, YEN, GBP, and many others using a system on top of current Maker-Dai system?     

Making another collaterized smart contract system with Ether or WBTC for some other crypto just seems like too much trouble, plus, would there be enough Ether and crypto in general to guarantee these other Dai-like tokens to be collaterized in a healthy way?     

What about a system where we could put normal Dai in and print something like DaiGBP, or DaiYEN? These tokens would be indirectly collaterized by the tokens already serving as collateral in the current Maker-Dai system, and would be much easier to print, plus we wouldn't need oracles for every currency and every crypto pair, we would only require info about the USD-GBP/YEN/EUR rates, so the system would be simpler.     

I am bringing this up because I was recently thinking about taking out a Maker loan to buy some stuff in my local currency, but then I would have to worry about my local currency decreasing in value against the US dollar.   

This system could also increase Dai demand and usage of the Maker system in general."

# Maker Token (MKR) Nedir?

  
 

**Maker coin**, [**Makerdao (MKR)**](https://makerdao.com/) **merkeziyetsiz** uygulamaya sahiptir. Bu uygulamanın işlevleri ise, Maker karşılığında **DAI** (Stablecoins) basmanıza izin veren bir alt yapısı bulunmasının yanında **merkezi olmayan** kredi alma ve kredi verme platformu olmasıdır.  


Geleneksel piyasada basılan paraların ne yazık ki bir dayanağı yoktur. Merkez bankaları tarafından basılan paraların ucu bucağı yoktur. Hatta bazı merkez bankaları ne kadar para bastıklarını dahi yayınlamamaktadır. Bu paranın doğasına bir ihanettir.  


Makerdao ise Maker kripto parasının işlevlerini ortaya çıkarabileceğiniz bir platformdur. Maker platformu merkeziyetsiz topluluklar tarafından yönetilir ve en küçük paydaş dahi yönetime katılabilir. Maker tokeni DAI basmanın yanında asıl önemli işlevi, bir yönetişim tokeni olmasıdır.  


Maker platformunda yönetişim modelinde yer almak ise oldukça kolaydır. Merkezsiz cüzdanınızda bulunan maker kripto paranız ile yönetimde alınacak her karara katılabilirsiniz.  
**Cüzdanlar, Merkezsiz finans uygulamaları (dApps) ve merkezsiz finans (DeFi)** entegrasyonu olan bu platform yüzlerce ortağa sahiptir. Bu uygulamaların hepsi yönetişime bağlıdır.  


MKR sahipleri, aynı zamanda **Dai stablecoin** için politika ayarlamayı, yeni teminat türlerini seçmeyi ve yönetişimin kendisini iyileştirmeyi içeren Maker Protokolünü yönetmekle de sorumludur. Herkes MKR sahibi olabilir ve herkes merkeziyetsiz finansın yani DeFi’nin geleceğini şekillendirmede projeye katılabilmektedir..  


## Makerdao Kar Payı Veriyor Mu?

Makerdao, maker token üzerinden dolaylı yoldan kar payı dağıtımı yapmaktadır. DAI oluşturma ücretlerinden belirli bir komisyon alan ve buradan sağladığı gelir ile maker token burn mekanizması oluşturan bir platformdur.  


**Token burn** (token yakma) mekanizma mantığı ise **akıllı sözleşmeler** ile belirlenmiştir. Her yeni Dai basıldığında ve Dai’ler geri verildiğinde platform ücreti üreten bu platform, ekosistemine bu ücretleri dağıtarak akıllıca bir ekosistem yaratmayı başarmıştır.

## DAI Kripto Dijital Para Birimi Nedir?

DAI tamamen merkezi olmayan, tarafsız, istikrarlı **kripto para birimi**dir. 1 DAI=1 ABD DOLARI olarak eşitlenmiştir. 1 DAI her zaman 1 dolara eşit olacaktır. DAI’nin bu işlevi istikrarlı bir para olma isteğinden gelmektedir.

DAI ile aynı zamanda bir mesaj göndermek kadar kolay ve hızlı para gönderebilirsiniz. Kripto dijital paranız her daim sizin kontrolünüzde olacaktır. Dijital cüzdanlarınızda DAI’lerinizi saklayabilirsiniz. Böylelikle aracı kurum riskini de ortadan kaldırmış olursunuz.

## Maker (MKR) Analiz, Yorum:

Maker token (MKR) Yorumumuz ise oldukça merkeziyetsiz bir proje olmasından dolayı olumlu yöndedir. **Ethereum** ekosisteminde, ethereum ekosistemi ile uyumlu çalışan ve bir çok siber saldırılara dayanıklı **blokzincir** altyapısı ile insanlara güven vermektedir.  


Henüz yeni çıkmasına rağmen 2021 yılı itibari ile 5 Milyar dolarlık kredi platformu her geçen gün artmaktadır. 2021 yılının başlarında her gün %10 büyüme kaydeden bu miktarın yıl sonunda 100 milyar dolara çıkabileceği beklenmektedir.  


Kripto para platformuna katılan yeni insanların ve yeni yatırımcılar ile beraber çok daha hızlı bir şekilde büyümesini sürdüreceği kaçınılmaz bir gerçekmiş gibi duruyor. **Merkezsiz finans (defi)** uygulamaları arasında kapsayıcılık bakımından lider konumda olan maker platformu, paranızın kontrolünü tamamen sizin elinizde tutmanız açısından da oldukça iyidir.

### Maker token (MKR) fiyatı

**Maker token fiyatı** 2018 de ilk zirvesini görmüştür. 1800 dolara ulaşan ve daha sonra tüm kripto paralar gibi düşüş göstermiştir. Coinbase, Binance gibi büyük kripto para borsalarında işlem gören bu kripto para 2021 yılında büyük bir atak yapmıştır.  


2021 yılı itibari ile zirve fiyatı olan 1800 doları aşarak 2000 dolar seviyelerine ulaşmıştır. Her geçen gün merkezsiz finansın rağbet görmesi ile birlikte, **maker (MKR) fiyatı** da yükseliş göstermeye devam ediyor.

Has much thought been given to whether DAI would be viable if this comes to be (especially if the currency was ethereum based)? My thought is that it would be viable as a marginal player because the DAI savings rate would create demand, but a central bank backed freely exchangeable currency would become the defacto standard."

However, I want to help my sister out buy giving her a down payment on a house.  If I don't want to sell the ETH since I believe it'll go much higher...is Oasis Borrow a perfect solution for this? (with risk).

If instead of selling the ETH for the down payment, I borrow against it with the hope it continues to rise (minimizing risk of liquidation) then eventually I could pay down that loan and get my ETH back and boom, magic.  I would also have some additional ETH on the side in case the price goes down, thus, allowing me to put more in to again minimize the risk of liquidation.

Is this the right way to look at it the utility of borrowing? Or am I missing something?

Hi everyone  
I am new to MakerDao and the MKR token and very intersted.

I  have noticed that the circulating supply is different then the total  supply, I was wondering how does that work, and where are the funds that  are ""out of circulation"" but still part of total supply?

How can I find out how many are in and how many out of supply?

Thank you :)"

Peanut partners with Curve. Protection from slippage and from skewing can be ported to MakerDAO ecosystem with Peanut,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/l0n4a0/peanut_partners_with_curve_protection_from/,Useful_Platform_,1,2021-01-20 00:21:34,0,/r/MakerDAO/comments/l0n4a0/peanut_partners_with_curve_protection_from/,NaN," Peanut will connect its protocol to Curve to balance price of trading pairs. In addition to the unique formula for equalizing the value of tokens in Curve trading pairs (more information in this article), Peanut will create for Curve users an additional layer of protection from slippage and from skewing the tokens value.

Due to the high volatility of the crypto asset market, the lack of unified trading platforms, as well as dynamic changes in supply/demand for a particular asset, crypto traders are quite often exposed to slippage as one of the negative factors.

Curve protects its users from slippage by using a unique formula for determining the value of assets in trading pairs. Additionally, Peanut protocol will integrate with Curve which will result in reducing negative effect from slippage and mitigating risks of impermanent loss. Due to the system of a two-level pool of assets operated by Peanut, placing even a very large order will have only temporary instant effect. When large buy/sell orders are executed, the Peanut pool automatically and simultaneously makes the corresponding deal on two levels, that is, on other DEX and CEX, and provides additional liquidity for specific trading pair. As a result, slippage in trading pair disappears.

At the moment, the Peanut team is winding up with integrational settings for Curve trading platform. In a few weeks Curve will be connected to Peanut protocol on the regular basis.

Speaking about Curve, Alex Momot, CEO at Remme and founder of Peanut said:

“The main challenge for us during the testing period is to check the ability to resist one-block flash loan attacks. Successful results will significantly improve AMM mechanics and will give much more confidence to all market participants.”

&gt;*Michael Egorov, CEO of Curve, said:*  
*“Balancing prices by exploiting liquidity on both DEX and CEX platforms is really a good idea. And also very promising. It will be very interesting to see the results of Peanut testing on Curve.”*

Peanut solves existing problems inherent in both centralized and decentralized trading platforms. Namely, the loss of customers as a result of slippage. And we are doing everything we can to improve our algorithms.

I bought 0.12 ETH to use for the vault as this was what I had to spare. Selected ETH-A and went to the 'Generate DAI' tab where I only just find out there's a minimum amount of DAI (500) that I have to generate, and my balance could only generate \~101 DAI (from what I remember).

&amp;#x200B;

So since I could not generate DAI, I clicked back to the dashboard, when I realised my ETH balance had dropped to 0.056! Went all the way back to the 'Generate DAI' tab and surely enough, my balance still somehow said 0.056 instead of the 0.12 ETH I had sent. Same with my Coinbase Wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm extremely confused, what happened to my ETH?? How did I end up losing half my balance without even doing anything??

### Increase the LINK-A Debt Ceiling

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQtn7UY?network=mainnet) governance poll, the LINK-A debt ceiling will be increased from 10 million DAI to 20 million DAI if this proposal passes.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-debt-ceiling-adjustments-11th-jan-2021/6005) signal thread for rationale and discussion relating to this change.

### Increase the MANA-A Debt Ceiling

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmSCLfXN?network=mainnet) governance poll, the MANA-A debt ceiling will be increased from 250 thousand DAI to 1 million DAI if this proposal passes.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-debt-ceiling-adjustments-11th-jan-2021/6005) signal thread for rationale and discussion relating to this change.

### Decrease the BAT-A Debt Ceiling

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmW4ei2M?network=mainnet) governance poll, the BAT-A debt ceiling will be decreased from 10 million DAI to 2 million DAI if this proposal passes.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-debt-ceiling-adjustments-11th-jan-2021/6005) signal thread for rationale and discussion relating to this change.

### Decrease the TUSD-A Debt Ceiling

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmXTGwq4?network=mainnet) governance poll, the TUSD-A debt ceiling will be decreased from 135 million DAI to zero DAI if this proposal passes.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-manage-tusd-exposure-due-to-ownership-change/5821) signal thread for rationale and discussion relating to this change.

### Increase the PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmfTU85J?network=mainnet#poll-detail) governance poll, a mandate exists for increasing the PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling to the value of 500 million DAI. Given the risk posed by new code (even after audits), the non-Foundation mandated actors have been pursuing a gradual increase to this target value. That policy continues as a part of this proposal. If this proposal passes, the PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling will be increased from 30 million DAI to 80 million DAI immediately, and it will increase linearly over the next 12 weeks to its target of 500 million DAI without intervention from Maker Governance. This gradual increase will be achieved by using the lerp  
 module developed by community contributors.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/road-to-the-psm/5353/85) thread for discussion and details on the development of the PSM.

### Increase the Debt Floor(dust) Parameter

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmWPAu5z?network=mainnet) governance poll, the Debt Floor (aka dust  
) parameter will be increased from 500 DAI to 2000 DAI for all non-PSM vault-types if this proposal passes.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-increasing-dust-parameter/5963) signal thread for rationale and discussion relating to this change.

### Vault Compensation Working Group Payment

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQcXFeC?network=mainnet) governance poll, 12,700 DAI will be distributed to members of the Vault Compensation Working Group as remuneration for their work on the ultimately unsuccessful Vault Compensation Proposal if this proposal passes.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-vault-compensation-working-group-payment/5562) signal thread for rationale and discussion relating to this action.

### Whitelist Instadapp on the ETHUSD OSM Oracles

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmNSb2cu?network=mainnet#poll-detail) governance poll, [InstaDapp](https://instadapp.io/) will be whitelisted on the ETHUSD OSM Oracle if this proposal passes.

Why Dai?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/l4x87t/why_dai/,Kalash4247,1,2021-01-26 04:51:41,1,/r/MakerDAO/comments/l4x87t/why_dai/,NaN,"Hi MKR community,

I'm trying to understand why we need DAI? At the end of the day all Maker is providing is a collateralized margin loan, which is nothing new in finance. Cryptocurrencies like BTC, LTC, XMR, etc. solely exist in order to transact with other people. DAI isn't offering anything different or exciting to me in the way I transact with people. Why do I even want a coin that is pegged to a US Dollar when I see the inherent flaws in owning Dollars at all? What value is added outside of providing another token pegged to a fiat currency we all want to forget about in the first place? The only value I can find is it might provide a short term pathway for lazy people to gain familiarity with the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole.

Please don't read this as ""FUD"" or some nonsense, I'm just trying to see if I'm missing something here.

Thanks for your responses"
