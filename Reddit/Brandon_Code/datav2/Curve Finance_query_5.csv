This AWESOME Community Got Me into Crypto!,https://www.reddit.com/r/SafeMoon/comments/n2ivb0/this_awesome_community_got_me_into_crypto/,GuyTorbet,1,2021-05-01 21:58:53,5,/r/SafeMoon/comments/n2ivb0/this_awesome_community_got_me_into_crypto/,General,"I have always wanted to give day trading a shot, but with so many options, it can start to get overwhelming. I attempted it for the first time a few months ago, and was disappointed - most large markets tend to be slow moving, boring, and require a large investment to make any meaningful returns; this is where crypto and SafeMoon steps in. Crypto is generally a lot more volatile than traditional stocks and shares, the price of a coin can plummet or soar in a matter of hours - high risk high reward, I like it.

By the way, I also just made a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/guytorbet)! Give it a follow, it'll be worth it I promise ;)! 

If you like this post, feel free to¬†[subscribe](https://torbet.co/subscribe) or check out my other posts¬†[here](https://torbet.co/)

Now, I'm ashamed to admit this, but in an attempt to decrease the endless boredom of lockdown, I caved and downloaded TikTok. Before long, I had made it onto finance recommendations (for whatever reason). I was scrolling meaninglessly until I discovered a video on the new cryptocurrency ""SafeMoon"".

Initially, I was sceptical - I mean, how many times have you heard ""become an early investor in the next Bitcoin"", so I did some more digging. SafeMoon is unique in that it rewards holding the coin for longer periods of time, #HODL if you're THAT cool. Every time someone sells their SafeMoon, 5% of it gets reimbursed to current holders, 5% gets burned, and the rest released back into the pool. This means that when people sell their SafeMoon, your amount increases and the value goes up. 

The nature of crypto is that there is a finite amount, meaning the laws of supply and demand apply to it; the more that is bought, the lower the supply is, the higher the price.  Given that this specific coin was garnering a lot of attention and therefore demand, the price curve already showed tremendous growth, so I decided to give it a try.

## My Attempt

I put in ¬£200 initially, and lost a lot of it. This was partly because it was my first time trying out crypto, I had no idea what I was doing, and spent a lot of withdrawal and transfer fees. But also because Guy Torbet apparently has the power to cripple an entire market under the sheer weight of his presence, because as soon as I figured out how to actually GET SafeMoon, the entire crypto market took a massive dip. Luckily it bounced back the next day.

This wasn't the end of the world,  I had seen the potential growth of Aragon ($ANT), invested in it, and it took off - mostly covering my losses. This was a pure fluke, and nothing on what I was expecting to make on my new love, SafeMoon.

Now, when crypto dips, what do we do? 

A) call it quits, sell it all, give others a free 5% of our holdings and end up losing money.

B) invest even more while the price is low and hope for the best.

If you picked A, shame on you, you have no place in this HODL cult. If you're a B, firstly, you have balls the size of coconuts, and secondly, please don't put in money that you cant afford to lose.

Now, a major reason why SafeMoon appealed was because of how new it is, it was developed just a few weeks ago, and hence, is not on the open-market or exchanges (yet). This will change in the coming weeks when it gets released more publicly, and should cause the price to skyrocket due to the increased demand for the coin.

As I became more confident in how crypto works, I felt more comfortable sinking a few more dollars into it. There was a huge dip in Polkadot, so I bought some for cheap, and the price has been rising steadily ever since. 

There is definitely some safer options (ironically), and crypto can be a very worthy long time investment, but I'm more a low effort big rewards right now kinda guy, so, I said fuck it, and went for it.

## How to Buy SafeMoon

1. Buy Binance coin ($BNB), I originally used Crypto.com to do this, but bailed due to their extortionate withdrawal fees, I recommend Binance themselves for this, fuck crypto.com.
2. Make a Trust Wallet account and transfer your BNB into it.
3. Swap your coins to BNB smart chain in the Trust Wallet app.
4. Open up pancake swap, connect your Trust wallet, and swap your Binance coins for SafeMoon. It is not officially on the PancakeSwap list, so enter the token (0x8076C74C5e3F5852037F31Ff0093Eeb8c8ADd8D3) or go directly [here](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x8076c74c5e3f5852037f31ff0093eeb8c8add8d3).

Additional steps: apparently Binance in the US is super duper shit, so you may need to find an alternative exchange to purchase your BNB. Occasionally PancakeSwap will drop an error when swapping to SafeMoon, click the settings icon and set your slipping rate to 11% (or slightly higher if it doesn't work).

---

I'm not upset about the losses, the way I see it, I invested in learning something new. SafeMoon, and most cryptocurrencies for that matter, is a massive gamble - but I'm gonna continue to hodl until we react the moon!

I like crypto, and will spend more time understanding it and researching, as it becomes more and more mainstream, the returns should only get bigger!

If you have some money to play around with, I'd put a bit into SafeMoon, but nothing that you can't afford to lose. It has massive potential in all aspects, but if you want a more long term investment, keep being an ""A"" and put your money in the S&amp;P 500 like a normie."
DD on SeaScape.Network: strong potential to gain x30 over the next 8-12 weeks?,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallcapcoins/comments/n2t36a/dd_on_seascapenetwork_strong_potential_to_gain/,Infamous_Sympathy_91,1,2021-05-02 06:25:39,0,/r/smallcapcoins/comments/n2t36a/dd_on_seascapenetwork_strong_potential_to_gain/,NaN,"On February 3rd 2021, I predicted that Audius, at $0.226 with a market cap of $27m would x20, 8 weeks later, Audius hit an ATH of $4.99 with a market cap of $580m. That post is given below and everything is documented and verifiable in time.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/lc0voc/audiousdt\_potential\_to\_pump\_20x/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/lc0voc/audiousdt_potential_to_pump_20x/)

My next prediction is Seascape, and the market cap is just $28m rn, very similar to Audius, however, in contrast to Audius, the networking effects are arguably 'stickier' and more significant within the game developer space than in the music artist space which Audius targeted. Seascape currently has a 24h trading Volume (ticker: CWS/USDT) of just $105k on [MXC.com](https://mxc.com/) and $168K on [gate.io](https://gate.io/) and $1.7m total trading volume across all platforms (coingecko numbers). Check it out here:

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crowns](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crowns)

[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/crowns/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/crowns/)

The same deep learning bot used to identify Audius identified Seascape as a prime candidate set to experience organic exceptionally outsized gains over the coming months.

**Current Technical and Price Action Analysis**

Recent price action showed an accumulation phase occurred over 5 days within a symmetric triangle formation above the $15 support zone (which held strong with heavy buyer activity seen), leading to a 50% upside breakout move, extending price action above the previous support of $24. Price action now remains steady within the $25-$30 region and it looks like another symmetric triangle accumulation will be forming before a 2nd upside breakout soon, especially if holders buy in following this post. A vigorous Elliot Wave impulse completing a fibonacci retracement to $50 is now strongly predicted, with an expectation of turning the $50 resistance level into a new support for growth towards $100. Price action has crossed and is being watched to stay above the 50 day MA.

**Fundamental Analysis**

**Investors:** Binance, LD Capital, Paka, Spark Digital Capital, Nabais Capital, M6, DU Capital, JRR Capital.

**Partners:** Chainlink, Moonbeam, Opensea, Maker, Binance Smart Chain, Matic and Treasureland.

Seascape seeks to become the STEAM game distribution platform for DeFi and this is a much more realistic proposition than becoming a massive AAA-game developer such as the Activision of DeFi, indeed, we are years away from seeing anything like that. Like Audius, this is a coin with a website that the GENERAL PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND with a product that can be used now, granted they only have a few games, they are developing their blockchain to make it very cost effective and scalable for much bigger game titles to use them as their **in-game coin economy** partner, making Seascape a great choice even if a game developer has much better distribution than Seascape now (which would only help Seascape further market itself).

Fundamentally, Seascape is an **in-game economy technology partner first and foremost. They are doing the hard stuff, unlike Ultra, so that they later this year become THE distribution partner of choice for DeFi game titles.** Ultra is basically Steam with tokens with a few big name game developers using them as first movers focused on marketing and player incentives, and hit an ATH of around $250m market cap. Seascape can do what Ultra does in a **much** more powerful way using their current technology AND Seascape intends to build out much more intensive player incentivisation than those Ultra has on offer now, so in terms of market cap, Seascape has the fundamentals to exceed Ultra by a factor of at least x3. Price target is $750 in 8-12 weeks.

I also have contacts at Supercell (who made the great Clash of Clans) and I will hook these guys up. I spent the last few days talking to the founder of Seascape and drilled him for information and believe they are on the right track for stellar growth.

**Seascape and NFTs:** 25,000 Seascape gaming NFTs have been minted on the BSC and millions of dollars dropped to users through their LP mining game. Increase in its NFT economy alone could add an extra $50m-$100m to its mcap over the next couple months.

**Whitepaper:**

**Remember**: this is a Reddit post, it is NOT financial advice, dispense your loads where ever you wish after doing your own DD and research and maybe throwing a dart at a wall. YOLO. I'm in for around 2,000 CWS held right now.

**Notes:**

pCWS is the bridged version of CWS (the currency of Seascape on ETH) on BSC (Binance Smart Chain). Users can bridge from ETH to BSC using poly.network bridge. 1 CWS = 1 pCWS as they are completely interchangeable. Here's a walk-through of Polybridge: [https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1](https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1)

**High number of coins in a few wallets:**

Audius had a similar position where 84% of coins were held in 2 wallets. Seascape's token release schedule is structured to cause growth in their ecosystem and corresponding growth in their price to mitigate future inflation effects. Essentially new games will be backed by newly released CWS acting as collateral for newly minted game coin economies generated on the Seascape blockchain. This means, as a new game grows its user base and its in game economy grows in value, those additionally released CWS should in effect pay for themselves mitigating inflation effects. Interestingly, Audius had a similar reason for releasing new coins, i.e. to attract new artists, and it grew from $27m mcap to an ath of $580m.

**KEY FEATURES:**

* Any game released on the Seascape Platform will have the option to create their own blockchain with its own set of rules.¬†
* Decentralized cross-chain bonding curve market to allow seamless price discovery of digital assets for users and projects
* User-facing game store built with DeFi in mind. Any user can serve as a PoS validator. Monthly gamepasses for users, no fees for game devs.
* Implement gamified aspects of DeFi and traditional finance into games as part of core gameplay. In-game staking, CDP's and more!¬†

Year End Results of XOP (Canadian Overseas Petroleum)- would love some feedback on my research!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadianstockpicks/comments/n2vfdc/year_end_results_of_xop_canadian_overseas/,TheCanuc,1,2021-05-02 08:39:29,13,/r/Canadianstockpicks/comments/n2vfdc/year_end_results_of_xop_canadian_overseas/,Stock DD," Hi guys, been lurking around the sub for a bit, but I haven't posted much. I have been doing a bunch of research on this company that caught my eye and with their recent year end results have confirmed their acquisition of Atomic Oil &amp; Gas, and I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts so here we go!

**Canadian Overseas Petroleum**

Ticker: XOP.CN - CSE &amp; COPL - LSE

Outstanding Shares: 14B

Share Price: $0.01

**About XOP.CN**  
Canadian Overseas Petroleum is an international oil and gas exploration, development and production company actively pursuing opportunities in the United States through the acquisition of Atomic Oil and Gas LLC with operations in Converse County Wyoming, and in sub-Saharan Africa through its ShoreCan joint venture company in Nigeria, and independently in other countries.  
**Atomic Oil &amp; Gas Acquisition**   
In December of 2020 XOP began talks with a Wyoming based oil producer, Atomic Oil &amp; Gas,  a single shareholder company that had become financially distressed due to the rock bottom price of oil during COVID. A purchase deal was negotiated and closed on March 16th 2021, with XOP receiving 100% ownership of Atomic and  backdated revenues to December 2020 (to be recognized as of Mar 16th for accounting purposes) when the discussions began. This represents a step-change in XOP‚Äôs fortunes as it immediately turns them into a tier 2 producer overnight! Facts about the deal:  


* This deal was signed at $39/bbl and is currently over $63 representing a 61.5% immediate return on investment on the purchase of atomic.
* This deal is unique in that most Oil &amp; Gas assets that get sold are either aged (declining production curve) or have other financial/production issues.
* Atomic has majority ownership of two young, oil producing fields the Barron Flats Shannon Miscible Flood Unit (57.7% ownership) and the Cole Creek Unit (66.7% ownership). Also one unitized exploration area‚Äîthe Barron Flats Federal Unit (55.56% ownership). 
* With the deal, COPL acquired 31.1 MMboe (24.7 MMboe net after royalties) of proved and probable reserves (2P) of WTI grade oil.
* Atomic began flooding of the Shannon unit in late 2019/early 2020 and was producing 1,400 BOPD at the gas injection rate they were utilizing (5 MMCF/d)
* When the injection rate is increased to the maximum engineered rate of 10 MMCF/d, production is forecast to increase to 7,000 BOPD (possibly more), this process began in early April and production should be stabilizing soon.
* Cole Creek was described as a duplicate of the Baron Flats Shannon field, and is ready for miscible flooding. Some oil must be drawn from the well to create room in the well for injection, which will also add some immediate incremental production.
* Once Cole Creek has been miscible flooded, combined production from Cole Creek and Shannon could reach 10,000 BOPD.
* Because these fields are so new in their operating life they have production incline curves, not decline curves.
* The majority of the wells needed for production have already been drilled, so no immediate drilling is needed.
* Fields are in the oil friendly state of Wyoming, with no legacy abandonment or reclamation costs. 
* The facilities on these sites are brand new and modern. It is a fairly green field as there is zero gas flaring, gas is captured, re-compressed and re-injected into the well. Also all of the equipment is electric and the electricity is drawn from a nearby wind farm.
* As part of the deal XOP will retain the technical team of Atomic, who will join their own technical team. Atomic‚Äôs technical team has the experience designing, installing and running the gas injection equipment, which needs to be duplicated at Cole Creek. It also has been mentioned by CEO Arthur Millholland that a project they are working on in West Africa would also use the same techniques and the technical team could be leveraged for that as well.
* Atomic has two affiliates: The Southwestern Production Corp., the operating entity; and PipeCo, a midstream company holding the pipeline and facility assets (owning the pipeline the pump their oil through).
* The other two interested parties are the operating partner and a JV partner of the original owner. XOP is likely to be able to consolidate to 100% ownership as the operating partner is in severe financial distress and the JV partner is a Chinese national corporation who has been informed by the US treasury they are required to liquidate their US assets.
* As part of the credit facility XOP received an option 20M more then needed to purchase Atomic, which could be used in conjunction with their recent 13M capital raise to fund the purchases to consolidate ownership of the fields.
* The credit facility used to finance the Atomic deal is structure to either mature in 2022 and be paid off, but has an option to be restructured, which the CEO has said may allow them to start paying a **dividend**.

**Other XOP Upsides**

* They are 50% owners in a JV called Shorecan, which has partial ownership of OPL226 which is offshore in the Niger Delta in Nigeria. This represents an opportunity nearly 10x as big as atomic.
* The reserves from OPL226 are in relatively shallow water and have been proven with previous drilling.
* There is estimated to be over 1B barrels of oil in the reserves covered by OPL226. And an estimated medium  term production of 60,000 BOPD, and upwards of 450,000 BOPD long term.
* Essar (the operating partner in OPL226), recently began updating their website regarding OPL226, and the Nigerian senate recently announced that they will be passing their updated petroleum development legislation in May.
* The net effect on XOP on the Shorecan/Essar ownership structure is that COPL owns 10% of the production from OPL226 with an option to buy an additional 20%.

**Other XOP Facts**

* Canadian Overseas Petroleum also trades on the LSE in the UK under the ticker COPL, it is currently under suspension as the Atomic purchase represents a RTO under their rules, and they must submit a prospectus for a re-list. The average volume for COPL on the LSE is 180M shares per day.
* Goldman recently predicted oil to reach $80 per barrel by summer, which would represent a 105% return on investment on the purchase of Atomic.

**Year End Report Discussion and Analysis**

Disclosure: Although I will do my best in this section to highlight my concerns as well as positives, I am generally bullish on the company so my analysis will likely reflect that bias.  


*UK re-list*  
This is likely to be one of the biggest factors in price movement of both XOP and COPL (barring any massive news on OPL226). It is set to re-list there end of may/early June. They were forced to suspend trading as the Atomic deal classified as an RTO under their rules. With their massive volume, the share price moves more easily there and will lift XOP with it.

**Atomic Acquisition**  
This represents breathing new life in the company. Unless the situation with COVID happens, XOP never even gets a look at this privately held asset, let alone at the insanely good (in hindsight) price of $39/bl. This is a young asset at the beginning of its 40 year operating life.

  
*Shannon Flats Miscible Flood Unit*  
This is their current money maker, by the end of April this field will be receiving maximum inputs of gas injection and will begin to raise production to predicted peak of 5,000 BOPD or more, so this production increase will begin to really show up on the books in Q2, and will continue to be a low cost revenue centre for them as all they are doing is injecting the gas and collecting the oil, at what is expected to be a very low cost (we should get more clarity on that in Q1 2021 financials due in June). Lastly because the official date for the sale is Dec 1 2020, but the accounting date of record is Mar 16th, XOP will be banking 4 months of revenue for Q1 2021 with the backed revenues from December.

  
*Hedging*

As stipulated by their lender, they took out hedging contracts for gas and oil. The contracts for 2022 constitute only \~20% of the Shannon field‚Äôs production, so I feel that it leaves lots of room to take advantage of oil prices rising. The hedging also increase each year, 21-23, which to me shows confidence by the lender and the company that they will be able to hit their production increase targets. Lastly from what I can tell they got decent prices for their hedging.  
*Reserve Report*  
I‚Äôll be honest, this one is a bit over my head technically, but what I can glean from it is that everything is on par from what they thought when they were looking to buy Atomic, so confirmation of the asset is a big plus of this report.  
*Upside of Cole Creek*  
Cole Creek currently has enough wells and the equipment to begin miscible flooding, some oil must be drained first before gas can be injected. This is estimated to produce 3,500 BOP,. because the fields are stacked reserves. They wi;; able to use horizontal drilling and other techniques to operate the Fields off of a much smaller number of wells as they essentially ‚Äòconnect‚Äô the different parts of the reserve with drilling  and continue injecting gas (this may be a bit simplistic, but is my understanding of it). This means increased production comes at a relatively low cost.  
Reporting in USD

One other small tidbit I noted, which might be nothing, or might be a bread crumb to the future. I doubled checked to see, but essentially all of the major Canadian oil companies report their financials in CAD (even TC, who has pipelines in Mexico and the US). XOP chose to report their financials in USD, now this may be to simplify the reporting accounting because their production is in the US, or it may be be an indicator of where they would like to see the company listed in the future.  
**Nigeria Updates**  
*Ownership restructur*e  
Notably XOP was able to settle their dispute with their operating partner in the OPL226 project, which resulted in the company having a carried position in which they will incur no costs until after the first well is drilled, and their position was increased from 5 % to 10%, and they retained their right to purchase an addition 20% stake.

*License risks*

There is still a real risk that the license for OPL226 does not get approved and they never get to drill for oil. The mitigating factor against this are that the president has shown his commitment to getting oil production in that country moving forward (he personally had a company‚Äôs license reinstated after there was backlash it had been unfairly taken away), as well as the incoming PIB legislation which will remove the current problematic regulatory body in Nigeria.

*Production upside*

This is where the long term future of XOP lies. The fields that directly surround OPL226 have recently begun producing oil (i believe they are OPL 83-85). One in particular has 18 wells on it‚Äôs prospect, and to give you an idea of the scale of OPL226, it has 9 **prospects** that could potentially reach that level of production. If even a portion of this potential is realized it is massive, the oil is in relatively shallow water and is believed to be of fairly high quality, and is low cost to get out of the ground. The low cost of production leads me to another interesting piece of information not in this year end report.  
*LOI on production boat*

In an interview the CEO explained the LOI that had signed for a boat to drill and pump oil for them at OPL226. It is a brand new boat that is currently having it‚Äôs controls certified (or it may be finished, the interview is a bit dated now), and because it is a new boat XOP has not be responsible for the commissioning costs (which can be quite substantial and usually need to be paid up front), and are only responsible for delivery costs (which is fuel to drive it from port to site at OPL226). This is an indication that once they receive approval for drilling, production will happen quickly.  
**General Risk Analysis**

*Negative history*

I‚Äôll take these few points to rain on the parade a bit, first point being that the management does not have a history of running a producing oil company or delivering production from the deals they sign. That situation has at least somewhat changed as they have closed on the atomic purchase. The thing that gives me even more confidence that the management risk is reduced is that the major US lender that they used to secure their credit facility is said to have O&amp;G experience and seem to be leveraging the loan to influence XOP‚Äôs operations and decisions. For two examples: the lender was the one who required the hedging contracts before giving the loan and of the 65M facility, 45M was for Atomic and the other 20M are for expenditures to be approved ‚Äúsolely at the discretion of the lender‚Äù which to me signals they have their fingers on the pulse and will be watching their investment. Which i believe should reassure shareholders.

*Dilution*

There is an absolute ton of outstanding shares. They have added 10b of the 14b shares this year to capitalize to buy atomic. This is obviously less than ideal but I feel this is mitigated by a few things. This trades on the LSE, and volumes on COPL (their UK ticker) have gotten into the hundreds of millions of shares, also on Friday it did 10M volume on the CSE and another 6M on the ATS for a total of 16M, so XOP‚Äôs shares are extremely liquid. I would also hope that in the future they would use some of their new found shares to help remedy the dilution dilemma.

My final thoughts are that there is a very bright future for this company in the short and medium term and their long term fortunes will hinge on both OPL226 and how well they manage the proceeds of their excellent acquisition. I‚Äôm really looking forward to hearing what everyone thinks and what other info people have found that i missed!"

Sagittarius we are approaching your half birthday or half way of your solar cycle. This is normally the point when we receive a completion of past 6 months of efforts. This year it comes with an eclipse in your sign on 26th May. This is a release and a completion of what you have been working on and trying to close on. But it would take till September to fully be ‚Äúfinished‚Äù. An important turning point, this eclipse comes with your ruler Jupiter also changing sign moving into its sign of strength providing you support in your critical house of home, place of living and family, adding support to the not so stable ground you have been standing on. From that stable footing we start a new phase in our contracts, commitments, partnerships, relationships with the June eclipse though with some reconsiderations and rework in early June and few fated encounters in May. This has long been in making. We will go into all of this today.

Sagittarius even though May starts mostly with a restless feeling of wanting to be left alone to deal with things that are going on within you or behind the scene, you would be whether you like it or not be thrown back into spotlight this month. The last of the eclipses in your sign is coming up at month end and most of this month will go into getting your life and health in order to receive it. No matter what hidden demons or power struggles or even overt strong words you have been dealing with towards end April, May would like you to bring order to the new life you are creating and be present in the moment right here, right now.

The 11th May new moon brings a dose of fresh energy into your work and health houses making it easier to start afresh with work opportunities, work environment, a new project or a new workplace. We have been facing volatility here for a while and is expected to continue to as you are literally been motivated to shake things up since Uranus moved in your house of work since 2019. Whatever was fake and ‚Äúsocially apt‚Äù been falling to the side and you go towards freedom with your fervent proverbial arrow. Change in jobs, routines (lack of), restlessness sometimes to the level of stress in nervous system comes with it as you vibrate at a different frequency now and if you daily life doesn‚Äôt match it, you feel a dissonance. You have been wanting to do everything possible to get rid of this dissonance, suppressing your own vibration doesn‚Äôt work here as it just creates a stress physically in your body and you physically feel it brewing like a ticking time bomb within us. So it needs a physical outlet. Outlet in form of freelancing, freedom in work, freedom where your time isn‚Äôt owned by someone else or atleast you have a say in how its allocated, using technology in finance / trading or working on new tech and unique projects. Work needs to be engaging, full of variety and inventive. Nothing less would do it. You need unconventional approach to work and projects with lively not stifling exchange of ideas. Routine life isn‚Äôt of interest. Even the health routine needs to be unique and full of variety with some possible dabbling into alternate healing methods too! This is your new life and more we try to go back, the more dissonance we feel. 

So May offers yet another opportunity to find your zen in your kind of routines as it gives you an opportunity to restart in work and health in your own untraditional way. This new moon of 11th May is especially open a door for Sagittarius rising/sun/moon around 21¬∫ or around 12 December born though all of you get this fresh infusion of energy in work and health. Your own way of bringing order which may be another man or woman‚Äôs chaos but its order to you and it works for you which is all that matters. But remember you have a strong body mind connection now so there is a lot of freedom in recognising role of our own thinking and mind on our body and actions. Sometimes lack of freedom is more in perception and mind, we constrain ourselves more than a place or relationship. 

Saturn the planet of structure and discipline is in your house of mind and speech, restructuring the way you think, you talk and giving you discipline to have a steep learning curve. As it would stand still on 23rd May, you would feel its pressure to restructure a lot stronger, it will also put a pressure on your restlessness. Asking you to make up your mind over the choices your life is showing you. It might also be indicating to you, that to get what you want in your work life may be either the communication style to authorities or your practical skill set needs some work and restructuring. Saturn lessons are never easy but they last us life time. The lessons, the courses, the upgrades in skills and communication restyling you might be doing, would benefit you commercially for your life time. It might also be pointing to change in neighbourhood or in local commute or transportation / travel. There is a restructure in your communication, skills and travel which this transit will prompt and this restructuring could continue to Oct before it shows full benefits. This is a tool available to you, it adds to you and upgrades your market value, your commercial viability, your self made wealth. I covered this in much details in 2021 video for you so please do review it as it would help you throughout 2021.

I think the best news of this month is Jupiter your ruling planet and planet that rules our expansion and growth moving into the other sign it rules - Pisces. This offers opportunities of support and growth in your personal life, home, family and gives you a more stable ground to stand on versus before when Neptune alone was making living situation very unstable or unclear. This is only a preview from 13 May to 28 July as this transit will only fully pan out in 2022 but you see a preview. I spoke of this in March video, I will link below if you want to go into further how you would benefit from it not just now but its the key theme of 2022.

https://youtu.be/DVCQM8IjHpk

This is the month of working towards your eclipse on 26 May which comes with a release, a letting go of old phase, an old identity as you take on a new identity in a new contract, relationship, partnership or a new chapter in being with others. This is once in 19 year release of your old skin, you are shedding an old identity and its been in making since last year but now there is a finality to it as we work through the last six months of its transit. You are driven to make a new connection, a new commitment, a contract that is fresh, more active, more fun and more intellectually stimulating - both professionally and personally. The fated contacts in May of 10/17/31 May which I mentioned in part 1 - take you closer to that new start in commitment - driving you towards it, revealing more information on it. Also with Saturn supporting you with the skill to convince authorities or elders around those dates, it gives you opportunity to get the green light of anyone who needs to give it. We still have a few reconsiderations and edits as we would have Mercury retrograde after 28 May to 22 June, diplomacy in discussions, back and forth on terms and renegotiations will come up. Signing anything after 14 May in my view should come with disclaimers as you might be missing some information which could mean edits. The Lunar eclipse in your sign is happening at 5¬∫ so November born Sagittarius will strongly feel the release of an old identity and phase. The June Solar eclipse in your partnerships is at 20¬∫ so around 11 December born will experience this new phase in contracts strongly but it offers all of you opportunity to begin afresh in partnerships and contracts. Words end of month will fly intensely so be careful of them and keep your travel plans more flexible as we can experience some turbulence there. 

Have a great month and season of eclipses ahead !"
The journey of a crypto noob.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n3m62l/the_journey_of_a_crypto_noob/,Maker-Mindset,1,2021-05-03 10:46:25,37,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n3m62l/the_journey_of_a_crypto_noob/,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,"TLDR; The learning curve of getting into crypto is HUGE. No step of the way is easy. Mass adoption seems like it's a long, long way off, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. This is my journey so far, as a crypto noob these past couple of months.

&amp;#x200B;

I got into crypto like many new people within the past couple of months during this awesome bull market.

While still a noob, I've put dozens and dozens of hours into research. I've done a deep dive these past couple of months. 

One of my skills in life is learning a new skill through research. I believe it's because I'm a patient and methodical person.  

That being said, learning crypto has been one of the hardest things I've ever tried.

The first step of the journey is you have to 'try' to understand Bitcoin, which is not easy for someone new to the space.  
To understand BTC, you have to understand the blockchain... Another difficult thig to wrap your head around.

Great, now you know WHAT Bitcoin is. Now you really need to understand WHY Bitcoin is so important.

The only way to truly do this is to do a deep dive on the history of the worlds economy. That's right campers, it's time to learn about the massive flaws of every fiat based economy, in human history.  


Doing so will lead you to today's economy, which is a dumpster fire(if you didn't already know).

After this understanding of the failure of fiat economics, and what a bad place most modern economies are in right now, you'll have a much better appreciation for how awesome Bitcoin is, and how vital it is to our future.   
Now you understand what all the hype is! Yes! Now I understand what Bitcoin is, and why it's the future! 

All of this was just to understand what Bitcoin is, and why it's important. 

Learning about Bitcoin of course leads to other alt coins and Ethereum. Now you have to do a deep dive on all of those things.

Some coins are pretty straight forward, but most others require a special deep dive to understand what they do.  
Some are fake, but make people thousands, or millions of dollars.  
This coin was LOVED by all, but turned out to be a total scam and tons of people lost a lot of money.  
Half the people love a coin, while the other half claim it's shite.

You hear a lot about Ethereum, which is not another coin like you originally thought, but a whole system with layers and layers of new things to know. Ethereum takes just as long to understand as it took to understand Bitcoin. Turns out, it's almost as important as Bitcoin, maybe more depending on who you talk to.  
Enter DEFI.

I'm not going to lie, I thought DEFI was just another altcoin that people were talking about.

While not as difficult to understand as Bitcoin, grasping DEFI(the system of Decentralized Finance) is it's own deep dive to be able to understand the what and why of it. And you can't just skip DEFI. It's integral to the whole crypto universe. 

Eventually, you'll get to the point where you feel comfortable in purchasing your own slice of crypto cake.  
Time to log into Binance and place an order!   
Oh wait, I'm in the USA and Binance isn't permitted here. That's a bit weird.

Oh well, luckily there's [Binance.us](https://Binance.us). Which turns out to be a completely different company, and doesn't have many of the coins you were excited about. 

Hmm, let's give Coinbase a shot. I'm hearing a lot of promising things about them.   
Set up wasn't too bad. Linking my bank account was a little odd because the Plaid network doesn't play well my bank(PNC). Apparently PNC hates Plaid and is suing them for using their logo. Ok, that's not great.   
Let's push through though because I really want to buy some ETH and BTC.

I buy my first few hundred dollars of BTC and ETH on Coinbase. Finally! 

First step down. Holy crap, that was a lot. It was weeks to get to this point, and I still feel like a small child in the crypto world.

What's that? Coinbase Pro has cheaper fee's and is a free upgrade to Coinbase? Okkaayy, good to know. Let's start using that now, though it would of been nice to know that little secret before hand.

I had a few others coins that I was interested in. To get these coins I had to create accounts on two other exchanges. I have accounts on 4 exchanges right now which seems a bit silly.

Time goes by a bit, still doing research. 

Hearing terms such as Yield Farming, staking, halvings, ETH 2.0, London upgrade, gas fee's, stable coins, cold and hot wallets, SEC lawsuits, proof of work, etc. SO MUCH TO LEARN  


I'm currently looking into putting a chunk onto the BlockFi network to get a good interest rate. I'm literally trying to DEFI guys!  


Well guess what, they use Plaid and Plaid hates my bank, and they won't let me manually add my account info, like most of the other exchanges. That sucks.  


Guess I can just buy BTC on Coinbase and transfer it to BlockFi. What's that? The fee is going to be what? Whoa...  


BlockFi uses Gemini, and Gemini will allow you to use your bank if you send them a wire transfer first(then you can do ACH). Ok, that's a lot, but luckily Gemini trades with BlockFi MUCH cheaper because their pals.   
Time to sign up for Gemini!   
They close my account and block me before I even try to set up payment. What?

That's right folks, Gemini has a long history of just blocking people, without telling them why, ever.   
I literally have no idea why they won't allow me to have an account.

Well, there goes that idea. Back to using Coinbase to transfer funds to BlockFi and just eating the crazy fee's. 

This all leads me to where I am now, today. Trying to figure out to transfer crypto between exchanges and wallets and not paying crazy fee's.   


It's a lot my crypto friends.   
A LOT.   
And I'm a patient person who likes to research.  
It feels like I'll never have a good enough grasp on all of this.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying this journey.   
I'm a believer. My wife and I have dove in head first.  
We're excited for this bull run, but also looking forward to the bear market so we can really get in.

It's exciting. It's just a lot.

So much so that I'm worried about adoption. It feels like it's soooo far away. I know mass adoption is key to the cryptoverse. 

Things need to change so much. The mass population does not want to do what I'm doing right now. Not even a little.

I know things will get better and easier as time goes on, which is what makes me not too worried about things right now.  


Crypto is taking off even with the crazy complexity. What happens as it get's easier and easier? More and more people will dive in. That's exciting. 

Sorry for the crazy rant. It's just that I spent all day today trying to do something that should of been super easy, and I had to vent.   


I definitely have the crazy Charlie vibe today.

Cheers all."
My perspective on increase in FUD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n3ncti/my_perspective_on_increase_in_fud/,jakeuser100,1,2021-05-03 11:58:07,13,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n3ncti/my_perspective_on_increase_in_fud/,PERSPECTIVE,"This post is meant to educate newcomers about the change in sentiment toward crypto, my interpretation of mass media, and the technology adoption curve. 

FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) is in the rise, though not in this subreddit for obvious reasons. Taking a look at other finance and investing related subs proves my point. Listening to traditional boomers/investors give public statements and on talk shows proves my point. 

Now I know veterans here will not be affected by FUD, this is a cryptocurrency subreddit after all. But, in my opinion, it simply proves the inevitable. 

There are five stages of technological adoption:

Innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggers. 

We‚Äôre past the innovator stage. This is the stage where people didn‚Äôt even care about the technology. This is the stage where mainstream media hadnt even caught a whiff of what‚Äôs going on. 

I believe we‚Äôre in the middle of the early adopter stage. This is the reason we‚Äôve seen massive institutional adoption, while simultaneously seeing prevalent FUD.

A prime example of the point in trying to illustrate is the company Tesla. For years they‚Äôve been innovating in a new industry, and for years they‚Äôve seen negative post after negative post. These were done by the people unwilling to adopt a new technology. Jokes on them, now every car company is hurrying to jump on the EV bandwagon and Tesla has a top market cap, and is the industry standard. The technology, which was once ridiculed, is becoming more adopted and mainstream. In hindsight, we can look back at Tesla and say the technological adoption was inevitable. 

For the uninitiated, this is your chance to get ahead in the technology curve. The FUD simply points to the inevitability of technology adoption, just like with Tesla. It won‚Äôt be a sure, linear path to the top. There will be bumps along the way, just like with Tesla on its way to the top. These bumps serve to shake out the paper hands, and separate the men from the boys. Those with the stomach for volatility, will be greatly rewarded in the end for their conviction."

Polygon is a new L2 scaling solution for not limited to but currently only for Ethereum.

**How does it work (ELI5)?**

The Polygon network also works like Ethereum. It processes transactions and stores it on a blockchain. Currently Ethereum is doing this very slowly using PoW, Polygon does it with PoS, which is faster. It then makes its own blockchain and puts snapshots of this on Ethereum. So Polygon has its own consensus which is faster but then uses the Ethereum consensus less, but still stores everything and make the network secure. On Polygon fess are so low , after 100 transactions, I couldn't see the difference in my balance. Transactions are also near instant. 

**How do I use it?:**

First you need to connect to the network. Polygon interacts with metamask just like Ethereum. So you are going to use your Ethereum address on Polygon. But first you need Metamask to talk to the Polygon Network.

Ok cool. Now change it back to the Ethereum Network. And go to the Polygon bridge. A bridge is a gateway between blockchains. You want to send your ETH, Matic, Linn whatever from Ethereum Network to the Matic Network.

You will need to wait about 10 minutes. Don't worry I also stressed the first time. According to Polygon, the transfer should take about 7-10 minutes. Also, set your ETH gas fee higher than normal to help speed up using the bridge. Once you have completed the ETH transaction, switch your Metamask back to the Polygon Network and wait for the transfer.

# Everything you Need to Know about Nami, the new cool cryptocurrency

I'll preface this by saying that this is not financial advice by any stretch of the imagination, furthermore, I have no idea how this whole crypto thing works, so take everything written here with a grain of salt.

I have always wanted to give day trading a shot, but with so many options, it can start to get overwhelming. I attempted it for the first time a few months ago, and was disappointed - most large markets tend to be slow moving, boring, and require a large investment to make any meaningful returns; this is where crypto steps in. Crypto is generally a lot more volatile than traditional stocks and shares, the price of a coin can plummet or soar in a matter of hours - high risk high reward, I like it.

Now, I'm ashamed to admit this, but in an attempt to decrease the endless boredom of lockdown, I caved and downloaded TikTok. Before long, I had made it onto finance recommendations (for whatever reason). I was scrolling meaninglessly until I discovered a video on the new cryptocurrency ""Nami"".

Initially, I was sceptical - I mean, how many times have you heard ""become an early investor in the next Bitcoin"", so I did some more digging. Nami is unique in that it rewards holding the coin for longer periods of time, #HODL if you're THAT cool. Every time someone sells their Nami, 5% of it gets reimbursed to current holders, 5% gets burned, and the rest released back into the pool. This means that when people sell their Nami, your amount increases and the value goes up.

The nature of crypto is that there is a finite amount, meaning the laws of supply and demand apply to it; the more that is bought, the lower the supply is, the higher the price. Given that this specific coin was garnering a lot of attention and therefore demand, the price curve already showed tremendous growth, so I decided to give it a try.

**Canadian Overseas Petroleum**

Ticker: XOP.CN - CSE \~\~ COPL - LSE \~\~VELXF - US:OTC

Outstanding Shares: 14B

Share Price: $0.01

**About** [**XOP.CN**](https://XOP.CN)

  
Canadian  Overseas Petroleum is an international oil and gas exploration,  development and production company actively pursuing opportunities in  the United States through the acquisition of Atomic Oil and Gas LLC with  operations in Converse County Wyoming, and in sub-Saharan Africa  through its ShoreCan joint venture company in Nigeria, and independently  in other countries.

  
**Atomic Oil &amp; Gas Acquisition**

  
In  December of 2020 XOP began talks with a Wyoming based oil producer,  Atomic Oil &amp; Gas,  a single shareholder company that had become  financially distressed due to the rock bottom price of oil during COVID.  A purchase deal was negotiated and closed on March 16th 2021, with XOP  receiving 100% ownership of Atomic and  backdated revenues to December  2020 (to be recognized as of Mar 16th for accounting purposes) when the  discussions began. This represents a step-change in XOP‚Äôs fortunes as it  immediately turns them into a tier 2 producer overnight! Facts about  the deal:

* This  deal was signed at $39/bbl and is currently over $63 representing a  61.5% immediate return on investment on the purchase of atomic.
* This  deal is unique in that most Oil &amp; Gas assets that get sold are  either aged (declining production curve) or have other  financial/production issues.
* Atomic  has majority ownership of two young, oil producing fields the Barron  Flats Shannon Miscible Flood Unit (57.7% ownership) and the Cole Creek  Unit (66.7% ownership). Also one unitized exploration area‚Äîthe Barron  Flats Federal Unit (55.56% ownership).
* With the deal, COPL acquired 31.1 MMboe (24.7 MMboe net after royalties) of proved and probable reserves (2P) of WTI grade oil.
* Atomic  began flooding of the Shannon unit in late 2019/early 2020 and was  producing 1,400 BOPD at the gas injection rate they were utilizing (5  MMCF/d)
* When  the injection rate is increased to the maximum engineered rate of 10  MMCF/d, production is forecast to increase to 7,000 BOPD (possibly  more), this process began in early April and production should be  stabilizing soon.
* Cole  Creek was described as a duplicate of the Baron Flats Shannon field,  and is ready for miscible flooding. Some oil must be drawn from the well  to create room in the well for injection, which will also add some  immediate incremental production.
* Once Cole Creek has been miscible flooded, combined production from Cole Creek and Shannon could reach 10,000 BOPD.
* Because these fields are so new in their operating life they have production incline curves, not decline curves.
* The majority of the wells needed for production have already been drilled, so no immediate drilling is needed.
* Fields are in the oil friendly state of Wyoming, with no legacy abandonment or reclamation costs.
* The  facilities on these sites are brand new and modern. It is a fairly  green field as there is zero gas flaring, gas is captured, re-compressed  and re-injected into the well. Also all of the equipment is electric  and the electricity is drawn from a nearby wind farm.
* As  part of the deal XOP will retain the technical team of Atomic, who will  join their own technical team. Atomic‚Äôs technical team has the  experience designing, installing and running the gas injection  equipment, which needs to be duplicated at Cole Creek. It also has been  mentioned by CEO Arthur Millholland that a project they are working on  in West Africa would also use the same techniques and the technical team  could be leveraged for that as well.
* Atomic  has two affiliates: The Southwestern Production Corp., the operating  entity; and PipeCo, a midstream company holding the pipeline and  facility assets (owning the pipeline the pump their oil through).
* The  other two interested parties are the operating partner and a JV partner  of the original owner. XOP is likely to be able to consolidate to 100%  ownership as the operating partner is in severe financial distress and  the JV partner is a Chinese national corporation who has been informed  by the US treasury they are required to liquidate their US assets.
* As  part of the credit facility XOP received an option 20M more then needed  to purchase Atomic, which could be used in conjunction with their  recent 13M capital raise to fund the purchases to consolidate ownership  of the fields.
* The  credit facility used to finance the Atomic deal is structure to either  mature in 2022 and be paid off, but has an option to be restructured,  which the CEO has said may allow them to start paying a **dividend**.

**Other XOP Upsides**

* They  are 50% owners in a JV called Shorecan, which has partial ownership of  OPL226 which is offshore in the Niger Delta in Nigeria. This represents  an opportunity nearly 10x as big as atomic.
* The reserves from OPL226 are in relatively shallow water and have been proven with previous drilling.
* There  is estimated to be over 1B barrels of oil in the reserves covered by  OPL226. And an estimated medium  term production of 60,000 BOPD, and  upwards of 450,000 BOPD long term.
* Essar  (the operating partner in OPL226), recently began updating their  website regarding OPL226, and the Nigerian senate recently announced  that they will be passing their updated petroleum development  legislation in May.
* The  net effect on XOP on the Shorecan/Essar ownership structure is that  COPL owns 10% of the production from OPL226 with an option to buy an  additional 20%.

**Other XOP Facts**

* Canadian  Overseas Petroleum also trades on the LSE in the UK under the ticker  COPL, it is currently under suspension as the Atomic purchase represents  a RTO under their rules, and they must submit a prospectus for a  re-list. The average volume for COPL on the LSE is 180M shares per day.
* Goldman  recently predicted oil to reach $80 per barrel by summer, which would  represent a 105% return on investment on the purchase of Atomic.

**Year End Report Discussion and Analysis**

Disclosure:  Although I will do my best in this section to highlight my concerns as  well as positives, I am generally bullish on the company so my analysis  will likely reflect that bias.

*UK re-list*  
This  is likely to be one of the biggest factors in price movement of both  XOP and COPL (barring any massive news on OPL226). It is set to re-list  there end of may/early June. They were forced to suspend trading as the  Atomic deal classified as an RTO under their rules. With their massive  volume, the share price moves more easily there and will lift XOP with  it.

**Atomic Acquisition**  
This  represents breathing new life in the company. Unless the situation with  COVID happens, XOP never even gets a look at this privately held asset,  let alone at the insanely good (in hindsight) price of $39/bl. This is a  young asset at the beginning of its 40 year operating life.

*Shannon Flats Miscible Flood Unit*  
This  is their current money maker, by the end of April this field will be  receiving maximum inputs of gas injection and will begin to raise  production to predicted peak of 5,000 BOPD or more, so this production  increase will begin to really show up on the books in Q2, and will  continue to be a low cost revenue centre for them as all they are doing  is injecting the gas and collecting the oil, at what is expected to be a  very low cost (we should get more clarity on that in Q1 2021 financials  due in June). Lastly because the official date for the sale is Dec 1  2020, but the accounting date of record is Mar 16th, XOP will be banking  4 months of revenue for Q1 2021 with the backed revenues from December.

*Hedging*

As  stipulated by their lender, they took out hedging contracts for gas and  oil. The contracts for 2022 constitute only \~20% of the Shannon field‚Äôs  production, so I feel that it leaves lots of room to take advantage of  oil prices rising. The hedging also increase each year, 21-23, which to  me shows confidence by the lender and the company that they will be able  to hit their production increase targets. Lastly from what I can tell  they got decent prices for their hedging.  
*Reserve Report*  
I‚Äôll  be honest, this one is a bit over my head technically, but what I can  glean from it is that everything is on par from what they thought when  they were looking to buy Atomic, so confirmation of the asset is a big  plus of this report.  
*Upside of Cole Creek*  
Cole  Creek currently has enough wells and the equipment to begin miscible  flooding, some oil must be drained first before gas can be injected.  This is estimated to produce 3,500 BOP,. because the fields are stacked  reserves. They wi;; able to use horizontal drilling and other techniques  to operate the Fields off of a much smaller number of wells as they  essentially ‚Äòconnect‚Äô the different parts of the reserve with drilling   and continue injecting gas (this may be a bit simplistic, but is my  understanding of it). This means increased production comes at a  relatively low cost.  
Reporting in USD

One  other small tidbit I noted, which might be nothing, or might be a bread  crumb to the future. I doubled checked to see, but essentially all of  the major Canadian oil companies report their financials in CAD (even  TC, who has pipelines in Mexico and the US). XOP chose to report their  financials in USD, now this may be to simplify the reporting accounting  because their production is in the US, or it may be be an indicator of  where they would like to see the company listed in the future.  
**Nigeria Updates**  
*Ownership restructur*e  
Notably  XOP was able to settle their dispute with their operating partner in  the OPL226 project, which resulted in the company having a carried  position in which they will incur no costs until after the first well is  drilled, and their position was increased from 5 % to 10%, and they  retained their right to purchase an addition 20% stake.

*License risks*

There  is still a real risk that the license for OPL226 does not get approved  and they never get to drill for oil. The mitigating factor against this  are that the president has shown his commitment to getting oil  production in that country moving forward (he personally had a company‚Äôs  license reinstated after there was backlash it had been unfairly taken  away), as well as the incoming PIB legislation which will remove the  current problematic regulatory body in Nigeria.

*Production upside*

This  is where the long term future of XOP lies. The fields that directly  surround OPL226 have recently begun producing oil (i believe they are  OPL 83-85). One in particular has 18 wells on it‚Äôs prospect, and to give  you an idea of the scale of OPL226, it has 9 **prospects**  that could potentially reach that level of production. If even a  portion of this potential is realized it is massive, the oil is in  relatively shallow water and is believed to be of fairly high quality,  and is low cost to get out of the ground. The low cost of production  leads me to another interesting piece of information not in this year  end report.  
*LOI on production boat*

In  an interview the CEO explained the LOI that had signed for a boat to  drill and pump oil for them at OPL226. It is a brand new boat that is  currently having it‚Äôs controls certified (or it may be finished, the  interview is a bit dated now), and because it is a new boat XOP has not  be responsible for the commissioning costs (which can be quite  substantial and usually need to be paid up front), and are only  responsible for delivery costs (which is fuel to drive it from port to  site at OPL226). This is an indication that once they receive approval  for drilling, production will happen quickly.  
**General Risk Analysis**

*Negative history*

I‚Äôll  take these few points to rain on the parade a bit, first point being  that the management does not have a history of running a producing oil  company or delivering production from the deals they sign. That  situation has at least somewhat changed as they have closed on the  atomic purchase. The thing that gives me even more confidence that the  management risk is reduced is that the major US lender that they used to  secure their credit facility is said to have O&amp;G experience and  seem to be leveraging the loan to influence XOP‚Äôs operations and  decisions. For two examples: the lender was the one who required the  hedging contracts before giving the loan and of the 65M facility, 45M  was for Atomic and the other 20M are for expenditures to be approved  ‚Äúsolely at the discretion of the lender‚Äù which to me signals they have  their fingers on the pulse and will be watching their investment. Which i  believe should reassure shareholders.

*Dilution*

There  is an absolute ton of outstanding shares. They have added 10b of the  14b shares this year to capitalize to buy atomic. This is obviously less  than ideal but I feel this is mitigated by a few things. This trades on  the LSE, and volumes on COPL (their UK ticker) have gotten into the  hundreds of millions of shares, also on Friday it did 10M volume on the  CSE and another 6M on the ATS for a total of 16M, so XOP‚Äôs shares are  extremely liquid. I would also hope that in the future they would use  some of their new found shares to help remedy the dilution dilemma.

My  final thoughts are that there is a very bright future for this company  in the short and medium term and their long term fortunes will hinge on  both OPL226 and how well they manage the proceeds of their excellent  acquisition. I‚Äôm really looking forward to hearing what everyone thinks  and what other info people have found that i missed!"

- 40k worth of crypto: DCA across various coins I believe in and stored in a hard wallet.
- 20k in super (until I get my PR, I'm not going to contribute more in my super as if I don't get to stay in the country, I refuse for DASP to eat up a lot of this)
- $4k cash (Very low interest rates meant moving my funds elsewhere made more sense)
- Maintain a 35% savings rate. 

After completing my accounting degree and working first in AR/AP and then in insolvency, after a couple of months, I realised it just wasn't for me. I didn't enjoy the work nor saw any genuine benefit in doing the CA/CPA (other than a pay rise if I jumped ship afterward) and didn't see the point of spending 2 years whilst working full time to a commitment in a field I'm disinterested in. I took a Master of IT for 2 reasons. First being to be able to stay in the country (I'm a few years away until I get my permanent residency) as it is my intention to live in Australia permanently and second, I realised IT isn't going anywhere so I'll be better off staying up to date and knowing technical aspects compared to your standard accountant.

Therefore my initial plan was to move into IT: specifically the cloud and networking. I intentionally asked to be IT support at my firm since my boss didn't mind saving money and I didn't mind the experience of learning what IT support workers do. I've been trying to move into IT support and was happy to start at the bottom in tech support intially until I was met with the hurdle of struggling to get past HR/recruiters who are not being convinced I have experience which has caught me completely off guard. 

For the curious: I'm the main IT support at my tiny office, troubleshoot all technology problems, install all software and hardware, have literally set up everyone in my office with new PCs when boss decided to upgrade for asset write offs last year and have even trained and presented everyone about cybersecurity awareness. We now have a cybersecure policy thanks to me. Currently working to digitalise all paperwork so we can stop wasting so much time finding things. 

Now for the title of this post: after sharing this to a mate, he asked me what I do in my spare time. Other than hiking, gym and catching up with mates, I'm absolutely obsessed with the financial markets.

I can't explain why but it began a few years ago when I decided to get my budget in order. Started browsing AusFinance and reading various books and things they didn't teach me about in my accounting degree. Realised I knew nothing so everytime I was curious about something, I'd Google it and read it up. The more I read, the more rabbitholes I fell into. 

Within no time, I was trading stocks, crypto, had my ETF portfolio set up which DCAing worked best for me. My daily routine became getting up and checking my phone for the overnight US markets on Bloomberg, reading AFR, Financial Times, Economist, Reuters and other sources throughout the day to reading charts and interviews with CEO/CFOs here and there to watching the opening bell before midnight. Been doing this more regularly thanks to covid. With crypto, my tiny 5% portfolio blew up to 30% so now I'm considering moving it elsewhere before the bear market arrives.

I then wanted to figure out how this recession would play out that I started reading up about economics, supply chain management, interest rates, the yield curve, real estate in various countries (specifically Aus, US, China, Canada), monetary and fiscal policy, what the RBA and more importantly what the Fed is currently doing and why it's important and also reading up about my speculative plays in stocks and crypto as there's fair money to make if you understand what's really going on in specific industries and small caps. 

Anyway, my mate from before said if I spent this insane amount of time reading white papers, staring at charts and trading + investing, why don't I just work for a fund and get paid to do what I spent a good chunk of my day doing outside of work. 

It never occurred to me that my obsession could be my job as I make side money on top my regular income but why not work for an investment bank, hedge fund, capital/wealth management and advisory firms?

So I then asked a buddy who works for a well known investment bank and he was shocked that I, a boring accountant, knew this much about financial markets. I don't think I know that much and feel I have much more to learn but like I said, it's an obsession which I love + it makes me a fair amount of $ on the side so I can't complain. I'm not a genius. I've lost thousands of dollars but have also gained thousands as well. It really is a learning curve. 

If you've made it this far, how should I proceed with joining corporate finance? Portfolio and asset management would be ideal for me but I'd be happy to start with advisory work. But I'm unsure because of the blow to my self esteem after being rejected so many times in the IT roles I've been applying for. 

TL;DR - what advice would you give a retail trader that works as an accountant if he wanted to work in corporate finance? Specifically asset/ fund management? What advice could you give to help me get my foot through the door which is my biggest hurdle?

Appreciate any advice and apologies if my post comes off as a rant."
The amount of assets in DeFi on Ethereum reached a record $25 billion,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Lewis_Cook11/comments/n4hteq/the_amount_of_assets_in_defi_on_ethereum_reached/,Lewis_Cook11,1,2021-05-04 14:39:25,0,/r/u_Lewis_Cook11/comments/n4hteq/the_amount_of_assets_in_defi_on_ethereum_reached/,NaN,"Analyst firm Messari reports that leading Ethereum-based decentralized lending platforms made significant progress in the first quarter of 2021.

The progress made by decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms Aave, Compound (COMP) and MakerDAO (MKR) is highlighted to a greater extent.

At the same time, company analysts noted that the value of outstanding loans in the sector also reached a record level, with Compound, MakerDAO and Aave accounting for the lion's share.

The Ethereum DeFi Pulse blockchain monitor shows that the total blocked value on the platforms is currently around $55 billion, down about 11% from the all-time high of $62 billion recorded on April 15.

While the total dollar value blocked in DeFi has declined, the total amount of ETH blocked in DeFi's Ethereum-based projects is hovering around the all-time high of about 10.74 million ETH.

Among other DeFi-related platforms built on Ethereum, decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap (UNI) holds nearly $6 billion, Curve Finance (CRV) holds $5.32 billion, and SushiSwap (DEX) holds $3.87 billion (DeFi Pulse data).

New to Matic and Polygon - Staking and Defi,https://www.reddit.com/r/0xPolygon/comments/n4iz24/new_to_matic_and_polygon_staking_and_defi/,cip43r,1,2021-05-04 16:06:52,7,/r/0xPolygon/comments/n4iz24/new_to_matic_and_polygon_staking_and_defi/,NaN,"**What is staking?**

Staking is the method of consensus of the Polygon Network. With BTC we stop people from behaving poorly by making the problems in the coding as difficult to solve as possible, thus it is a waste of time to attack the BTC network because it costs electricity. With Proof of Stake, be disinsentivise persons to behave poorly by making them put down a deposit. If they behave correctly, they get some tokens, if they attack the network and behave poorly, we fine them. Basically, people will argue with me, but this is all a not techie needs to know if they just want to use the dApps.

**What is DeFi?**

In the past if you wanted to send YOUR money to someone else, you had to do it through a bank. The reason for this is because you trusts banks, banks have been here long and we trust them, so they are the middle men in transactions. With Decentralized Finance, we remove the need for a middle man, by removing the need for trust. How we achieve this is quite insane, but all you need to know is with some cool coding, you can borrow and lend money without ever trusting the other person.

**What is Lending?**

Lending is when you use DeFi to lend your crypto to other people. In return you earn some interest on your crypto.

**What is Borrowing?**

With Defi you are able to put down some of your own crypto as collateral, in case you run away with the money, to borrow someone else's crypto. You may ask why? Well this allowsy your to hold your BTC, but borrow some USDT to buy more, or to buy another crypto. Or you can borrow BTC, sell it, wait until the price dips, buy more BTC back and pay off the loan. Possibilities are endless.

**What are DEXs?**

Decentralized exchanges allow us to swap tokens with other people without the need for trust

**How do I stake?**

Before you stake there are a few things that you need to know. Staking is done from the Ethereum side of things. So if you want to stake your Matic, you need to hold it in your Ethereum Wallet. Secondly, you will need Ethereum for gas. Be sure to check that your rewards for staking will be worth it, due to high ETH fees. 

Start by switching Metamask to the Ethereum network and go to this [link](https://wallet.matic.network/staking/)

**How do I DeFi?**

**[QuickSwap](https://quickswap.exchange)**

QuickSwap is one of the largest DEXs on the Polygon Network. On QuickSwap you are able to swap tokens and provide liquidity. Liquidity is a way for you to help people swap, by providing the liquidity required for the trades. In return you earn fees and your balance of both tokens will change as the price fluctuates. It is important to note, that you need to provide the same amount of both when providing liquidity.

Currently QuickSwap is running a rewards program where you can earn QUICK tokens by providing liquidity. This is quite rewarding and will be very profitable if you have a very large amount of crypto.

**[Aave](https://app.aave.com/dashboard)**

Aave is an open source lending and borrowing protocol. It allows you to deposit tokens to earn interest as well as borrow crypto. The interface is quite simply. Just deposit and borrow, but always be sure that your health factor is above 1.0. Otherwise your loan will be liquidated. I keep it at 2.8 at all times. This allows me to borrow 40% of all my crypto in stable coins.

Currently Aave is running a rewards program in partnership with Polygon. This allowsy you to earn interest in all of your tokens as well as insane amounts of Matic. What is even crazier is that you earn interest for borrowing crypto. So currently I am borrowing 40% of my crypto in stable coins and paying 5% interest, but earn 25% interest in Matic. It's insane.

Another thing you can do is borrow crypto and deposit it back into Aave. This allows you to earn crypto on your deposit, earn crypto on the loan eand earn crypto for depositing the loan.

**[Curve](https://polygon.curve.fi)**

Curve is a stablecoin swap protocol, but not limited to dollar pegged stable coins. What this means is, Curve has found a genius method of swapping stbale coins, or coins with the same price with low fees and slippage. This allows you to swap USDT for DAI or BTC for renBTC or WBTC very efficiently. In order to achieve this, curve also requires liquidity. The fun thing about curve is you do not need to provide equal amounts of each pair.

Curve is currently running a reqrds program in partnership with Polygon. They allow you to deposit any USDT, DAI and USDC and earn about 10% interest, as well as 40% interest in Matic.

**What am I doing?**

I converted all of my tokens on Binance to ETH.

Then I withdrew my ETH to the Binance Smart Chain network in order to reduce withdrawl fees.

Then I used the [Binance Bridge ](https://www.binance.org/en/bridge) to send my ETH to the Ethereum network.

Then I used the [Polygon Bridge ](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/)to send my ETH to the Polygon Network. Important, Polygon gives you 1 MAtic with a new wallet, so you do not need to put in Matic initially, but always check that you have Matic in your wallet, just as you would for ETH in order to pay gas fees.

Then I go to QuickSwap and swap my ETH back to all of my original tokens.

Then I go to Aave and deposit everything.

Then I take out a loan until my health factor is 2.8. My stable coin of choice is always the own with the lowest borrow interest, but highest matic reward.

I then take stablecoin and deposit it in to Curve.

Finally, I check everthing on the best DeFi app ever [Zapper](https://zapper.fi/dashboard). Zapper is a portfolio manager and shows you where all of your DeFi tokens on the ETH, Matic and BSC networks.

I'm an MBA/MS of Finance student from Beantown and I wanted to share this with you. Keep in mind that I'm not a financial advisor and none of which I write about about should be be considered advice. 

As of today (5/3/2020) I spoke to 3 different Hedge Fund managers and 2 of their Senior level Portfolio Managers. Two of which I attended Harvard University with. 1x JP Morgan, 1x Goldman and 1x at Sig Sigma- who I served with in the Marines. These 3 people have NO VESTED INTEREST IN AMC OR GME OR ANY MEME STONKS. 

I wanted to figure out what the enemy strategy would be and this is what I got.

1. They want us to sell off at $1000.00 or LOWER -----I know a lot of you are eager to make money and profits during the squeeze. BUT I URGE YOU USE RESTRAINT and NOT SELL OR TAKE PROFITS UNIL THE PRICE OF THE SHARE HITS $100,000.00 PER SHARE. FUD will be at an all time high. 
2. EVERY SHARE SOLD BY RETAIL- STUNTS THE GROWTH OF THE SQUEEZE (reason being the Supply and demand curve). EVEN 1 SHARE is added to the Stock Market Algorithm and it's denigrates the ability of the stock to rise. You read that correctly EVEN 1 share sold. Plus the Behavior/Psychological affects of low sell off cause panic selling.
3. BUY SHARES DURING THE SQUEEZE. The Hedge Funds will try to induce panic selling by selling their shares. If you have the money, buy a few of them DURING THE SQUEEZE.
4. This squeeze will take 2 weeks to complete if all goes according to plan. Its somewhere in the last week. Somewhere in the middle where we will plateau ABOVE $100,000.00 per share. So in other words we all hold until we hit $100K (1 week of NOT SELLING, INCLUDING WEEKENDS).
5. TAKE PROFITS AT $100,000.00 and NOTHING LOWER, if we hold it- it will somewhere between$200K-299K per share within a few days."

Question: is it possible for HF's to flatten the MOASS curve by slowly buying back shares in orchestrated manner?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n4xyre/question_is_it_possible_for_hfs_to_flatten_the/,Dublin_Kopite82,1,2021-05-05 04:53:50,22,/r/Superstonk/comments/n4xyre/question_is_it_possible_for_hfs_to_flatten_the/,Question ‚ùì,"This is a question I have which I hope alot of people on here well smarter than me can answer and and make a solid case against it. 


I know very little about finance.. üëç

I am not a shill or bot üëç

I am not selling my XX shares üëç

Is there a way that the HF's can manage the severity of a squeeze by colluding together and orchestrate the margin calls sequentially rather than it blowing up all at once?


For example lets say there are five HF's who have shorted random values of shares as below: 

HF1 10,000 shares
HF2 5,000 shares
HF3 1,000 shares
HF4 500 shares 

If they were all margin called at the same time they would effectively be competing we each other to buy 16,500 shares and if everyone is holding the value keeps pushing up as the weight of supply versus limited demand kicks of a MOASS. 

What if they managed to control the share price (ie at $180 for 2 weeks) while HF 3 &amp; 4 bought back their shares (1,500) and then did something similar for say HF2 (ie at $160 for 2 weeks) and finally HF1 10,000 keeping the price lowest (ie at $140 for 4 weeks). Would this in effect flatten the curve of the MOASS keeping the share price at a lower level while they slowly buy back the shares? 

There is likely something really obvious i am missing but happy to ask the dumb question incase others were wondering the same.

Just slightly ahead of Curve Finance, Uniswap holds the number one position as the most popular decentralized exchange. Uniswap V3 upgrade should boost this precarious lead even further.

By pioneering automated market makers (AMMs) in November 2018, Uniswap cleared the way for the decentralized future of finance. One without the influence of hedge funds as market makers, exchanges, and clearing houses, all in one corruptive package.

When JP Morgan talks of ethereum eventually outperforming bitcoin, DeFi protocols like Uniswap will drive its value. The Uniswap team teased us with a V3 upgrade just a month ago, promising the long-anticipated layer 2 scaling. Such an upgrade couldn‚Äôt come sooner, given the breakneck pace at which DeFi traffic flows into Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

As Uniswap‚Äôs weekly trading volume surpassed $10 billion this month, there is little doubt that the protocol will become a major DeFi player in the near future. Its V3 upgrade overhauls much of the fee structure and incentives, giving LPs new tools to fine-tune their gains.

However, they will also require greater engagement. Uniswap V3 is scheduled to launch on May 5, followed suit by [Optimism‚Äôs roll-out.](https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-layer-2-optimism-increasing-mainnet-soft-launch/)"

Good day fellow investors,

I would like to recommend to you polycat.finance on the matic network as my favorite yield farming project in the mean time.

4 days old project, highest APRs on the matic network currently (some have around 2500%).

Devs are very fast and ahead of the curve, the price has been going up from around 12$ to 37$ in 24 hours.

Supply of fish is capped at 3M, which will help the price go higher in the long run.

Emission rates are being reduced to 0.8 fish per block to help further increase the price.

They added the value of how much your staked lp tokens are worth in real life time. (Which is a big deal for me instead of guessing or having to unstake to check).

They are adding vaults soon to increase fish burn rate.

Percentage of transactions fees is used in a smart contract to buy back fish.

They have a compound function for their main Fish pool.

And the dev team has also more things coming.

The project is early but catching speed very fast, get in early and make use of the high APRs as they go down with time, the sooner the better.

The matic network transaction fees are sooooo low, I have used a total of 1 dollar for almost the sum of 30 transactions.

"Newly listed KUCOIN gem: CWS... DD on SeaScape.Network, strong potential to gain x20 over the next 8 weeks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kucoin/comments/n6gln6/newly_listed_kucoin_gem_cws_dd_on_seascapenetwork/,Infamous_Sympathy_91,1,2021-05-07 04:19:44,16,/r/kucoin/comments/n6gln6/newly_listed_kucoin_gem_cws_dd_on_seascapenetwork/,KuCoin Crypto Gem,"On February 3rd 2021, I predicted that Audius, at $0.226 with a market cap of $27m would x20, 8 weeks later, Audius hit an ATH of $4.99 with a market cap of $580m. That post is given below and everything is documented and verifiable in time.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/lc0voc/audiousdt\_potential\_to\_pump\_20x/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/lc0voc/audiousdt_potential_to_pump_20x/)

My next prediction is Seascape, NEWLY listed on the GREAT KUCOIN exchange, and the market cap is just $40m rn, similar to Audius, however, in contrast to Audius, the networking effects are arguably 'stickier' and more significant within the game developer space than in the music artist space which Audius targeted. Check it out here:

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crowns](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crowns)

[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/crowns/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/crowns/)

The same deep learning bot used to identify Audius identified Seascape as a prime candidate set to experience organic exceptionally outsized gains over the coming months.

**Current Technical and Price Action Analysis**

Recent price action showed an accumulation phase occurred over 5 days within a symmetric triangle formation above the $15 support zone (which held strong with heavy buyer activity seen), leading to a 50% upside breakout move, extending price action above the previous support of $24. Price action now remains steady within the $25-$30 region and it looks like another symmetric triangle accumulation will be forming before a 2nd upside breakout soon, especially if holders buy in following this post. A vigorous Elliot Wave impulse completing a fibonacci retracement to $50 is now strongly predicted, with an expectation of turning the $50 resistance level into a new support for growth towards $100. Price action has crossed and is being watched to stay above the 50 day MA.

**Fundamental Analysis**

**Investors:** Binance, LD Capital, Paka, Spark Digital Capital, Nabais Capital, M6, DU Capital, JRR Capital.

**Partners:** Chainlink, Moonbeam, Opensea, Maker, Binance Smart Chain, Matic and Treasureland.

Seascape seeks to become the STEAM game distribution platform for DeFi and this is a much more realistic proposition than becoming a massive AAA-game developer such as the Activision of DeFi, indeed, we are years away from seeing anything like that. Like Audius, this is a coin with a website that the GENERAL PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND with a product that can be used now, granted they only have a few games, they are developing their blockchain to make it very cost effective and scalable for much bigger game titles to use them as their **in-game coin economy** partner, making Seascape a great choice even if a game developer has much better distribution than Seascape now (which would only help Seascape further market itself).

Fundamentally, Seascape is an **in-game economy technology partner first and foremost. They are doing the hard stuff, unlike Ultra, so that they later this year become THE distribution partner of choice for DeFi game titles.** Ultra is basically Steam with tokens with a few big name game developers using them as first movers focused on marketing and player incentives, and hit an ATH of around $250m market cap. Seascape can do what Ultra does in a **much** more powerful way using their current technology AND Seascape intends to build out much more intensive player incentivisation than those Ultra has on offer now, so in terms of market cap, Seascape has the fundamentals to exceed Ultra by a factor of at least x3. Seascape has the fundamentals to exceed Ultra by a factor of at least x3. Price target is $750 is 8-12 weeks.

I have contacts at Supercell (who made the great Clash of Clans) and I will hook these guys up. I spent a few days talking to the founder of Seascape and drilled him for information and believe they are on the right track for stellar growth. Moreover, Seascape's IDO platform for launching new games will be released soon so **CWS holders will automatically become investors in an entire defi games industry that will be built on top of the Seascape network**, much of the token release schedule is focused on growing that so the inflation effects of new token release should be more than mitigated by their use in supporting this new gaming industry sector which could be worth billions.

[CWS = Prime HODL Token](https://preview.redd.it/lsdc3d6m5kx61.jpg?width=1112&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06a8569d718cebf235c66cba583d2772eee001ad)

**Seascape and NFTs:** 30,000+ Seascape gaming NFTs have been minted on the BSC and millions of dollars dropped to users through their LP mining game. Increase in its NFT economy alone could add an extra $50m-$100m to its mcap over the next couple months.

**Whitepaper:**

**Remember**: this is a Reddit post, it is NOT financial advice, dispense your loads where ever you wish after doing your own DD and research and maybe throwing a dart at a wall. YOLO. I'm in for around 2,000 CWS held right now.

**Notes:**

pCWS is the bridged version of CWS (the currency of Seascape on ETH) on BSC (Binance Smart Chain). Users can bridge from ETH to BSC using poly.network bridge. 1 CWS = 1 pCWS as they are completely interchangeable. Here's a walk-through of Polybridge: [https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1](https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1)

**High number of coins in a few wallets:**

Audius had a similar position where 84% of coins were held in 2 wallets. Seascape's token release schedule is structured to cause growth in their ecosystem and corresponding growth in their price to mitigate future inflation effects. Essentially new games will be backed by newly released CWS acting as collateral for newly minted game coin economies generated on the Seascape blockchain. This means, as a new game grows its user base and its in game economy grows in value, those additionally released CWS should in effect pay for themselves mitigating inflation effects. Interestingly, Audius had a similar reason for releasing new coins, i.e. to attract new artists, and it grew from $27m mcap to an ath of $580m.

**KEY FEATURES:**

* Any game released on the Seascape Platform will have the option to create their own blockchain with its own set of rules.¬†
* Decentralized cross-chain bonding curve market to allow seamless price discovery of digital assets for users and projects
* User-facing game store built with DeFi in mind. Any user can serve as a PoS validator. Monthly gamepasses for users, no fees for game devs.
* Implement gamified aspects of DeFi and traditional finance into games as part of core gameplay. In-game staking, CDP's and more!¬†

What if a large investment firm or a private company invested in Bitcoin or other crypto wanted to stake their assets to earn interest? Which project might be best suited for decentralized institutional staking?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n6kjxy/what_if_a_large_investment_firm_or_a_private/,rocketrocketleague1,1,2021-05-07 07:15:04,11,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n6kjxy/what_if_a_large_investment_firm_or_a_private/,STRATEGY,"This thought just came across my mind and as far as I'm aware, only one private company has stated publicly stated they are involved in staking their assets in a pool to gain interest (see info at the end about Vesper)

There's a large piece of institutional money just hanging out there to possibly be added to some projects total value locked either soon or the not so distant future.

*Some of the projects I was thinking about:*  

**Uniswap** only offers liquidity pools which would be risky due to inherent loss for an institutional investor looking for something more stable like single pool staking.  That would rule out a lot of defi staking if institutions aren't willing to take on the risks of IL

**Pancake Swap** would be highly unlikely just due to the unprofessional feel of the exchange (not that there is anything wrong with that per se, I just dont think its geared toward that type of investor)

**Aave** or **Bancor** could potentially be good fits.  Not sure if Bancor has the same clout nor near the total value locked of Aave.

**Curve** is interesting, not sure what to make of it, the windows 3.1 theme is cool though.

Dark horse candidate possibly **Vesper Finance**, they just teamed up with Blockforce to allow traditional investors access to crypto and grow their returns in Vesper's pools.  However, Vesper would need more partnerships and time in the market to attract more attention.  They have decent TVL but market cap is still small.

Anything else you folks can come up with or might want to discuss?  

I feel like there's opportunities ripe for the picking here in terms adding something to the portfolio that caters to these needs."

I think Jim Bob thought it was finance related. I read that most of the Duggar LLC's have been dissolved including the one in Jana's name. There was involvement with TLC until around spring 2020, then tapings seemed to have stopped. The first lawyer on Josh's case is more finance/real estate related.

Anna announced 7th pregnancy only days before the arrest. No way they would have done that knowing the charges. Makes no sense. Not even Michelle would agree to that faux picture of perfection.

I highly doubt the extended family knew. I think they found out at the same time as public or shortly before.

* Overwhelming amount of projects and therefore research

In traditional finance, these problems are mitigated using ETF's, exchange trade funds. ETF's are a group of assets in a single purchasable share which represents stocks related to specific industries, or bundles designed to minimize risk and hedge different stocks possible failing unexpectedly.

Purchasing an ETF allows you to buy into industries, not just companies, by purchasing a hand picked and weighted basket of goods which is unlikely to produce a loss if the whole industry takes off, but a single company or stock within it fails unexpectedly.

What Plethori brings to DeFi is democratized ETF's for crypto currency assets on Ethereum and PolkaDot blockchain, including wrapped assets such as Bitcoin, and down the road integration of Cardano (when they implement smart contracts).

This means that anyone can now create and share ETF's, earning a percentage of the trading fees associated with that ETF. Savvy investors can let their followers, friends, family invest in all the same things they do with the purchase of a single asset at any price point desired. Top ETF's earn spots on the leaderboard as well as NFT's with special perks to the owners.

Investors with huge capital can invest broadly in new innovations in crypto, like layer 2 scaling, DEXes, smart contracts, by purchasing an ETF with all the relevant cryptos, rather than having to do significant research and manual portfolio balancing and diversification.

This means too that retail investors uneducated in crypto can stop fomo'ing into high risk meme stocks like Doge where they could easily lose money, and instead purchase low risk ETF's which will grow with the entire space.

1st year:

\-ECO101 will be the course that requires the highest amount of studying compared to all the other (the prof you take the class with does not make a huge difference). Do not expect to get a high grade in the course, but as long as you review the class concepts, do past midterms and make sure you understand the concepts well

\-RSM100 is pure memorization. The midterm is decent but the final is made so the average drops. This class should be easier than ECO101

\-Do not worry to much about deciding you specialist during the first term, as you have not taken RSM230 (Financial markets) and either RSM219 or RSM250. Once you have taken all the introductory courses, take your time to see which fields you enjoy and go from there. You can still switch your specialist in 2nd year

\-ECO102 tends to be much better than ECO101. It's just deriving formulas (AE) and curve shifting, but the course is much easier than ECO101  

2nd year: 

\-If you can, take ECO220 during the summer so you get it over with and only have to take ECO204 through your 2nd year

\-If you do summer school, DO NOT take 4 courses. That causes you to slack off and be lazy. Take the usual 5 courses and keep the extra credit in case you have to drop one course in the future

\-ECO204 seems very difficult, but if you treat it as ECO101 and study accordingly, you will do well. Personally, I found ECO204 better than ECO101, and my final mark was higher. Ajaz is a bit of a characters, but he is a good prof, and he gives a nice curve at the end of the course

\-If you are set in specializing in Finance and Econ or Management and Finance, I would advice you to take RSM332 (Capital Market Theory) in the Fall term of your second year, as it is a prerequisite for upper year Finance courses like RSM333 (Corporate Finance) and RSM430. You could then take RSM333 in winter (as it is a prereq for courses like RSM437 and RSM439), and be in a better position for 3rd and 4th year. If you take RSM332 in Winter, however, you will still be on track for 3rd year. 

\-If you want to specailize in Marketing, take RSM350, Marketing Management, either during Winter of 2nd year or Fall of 3rd year.

3rd year:

\-ECO209 (Intermediate Macro) is known to be a GPA killer. If you want to avoid this course but still want to go the Finance route, pick Management with a Finance focus (I have been told that recruiters do not have a preference of one over the other). This will save you from taking a lot of the ECO300 level courses required for Fin  and Eco, and will make it easier to maintain a high GPA.

\-DO NOT take ECO339 (Labor Economics) with Michael Baker. His quizzes are time constrained, the TA expects you to master State (despite the online learning) and the final average is a C+.

\-For students specializing in Fin and Econ or Management-Finance, taking RSM333 during Fall puts you in a better position for Winter, as you will be able to take any RSM400 Finance course during Winter and/or your 4th year.

\-If you are considering doing the focus in Strategy, take RSM392 during Fall so that you are able to take the other 2.5 FCE (5 courses) Strategy courses during Winter of 3rd year and your 4th year

4th year:

\-This is the best year, as you will most likely have finished all the required courses, and will have the freedom to pick courses solely related to your specialization (Accounting, Finance, Strategy).

"Basel 3 affects , stimulus and short term expectation",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n814rk/basel_3_affects_stimulus_and_short_term/,Kimaxw,1,2021-05-09 07:23:17,298,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n814rk/basel_3_affects_stimulus_and_short_term/,DD,"In my previous post entitled ‚ÄúInflation is here ‚Äù, I went through the various tools I use in my process and how each of them signaled that the bottom was either already in place or it was close, i.e. Nothing has changed in the past week to suggest anything different. If anything, the bullish case for precious metals and miners has strengthened, especially from a fundamental perspective.

Quick on the heels of its $1.9tln stimulus package, the Biden White House is now doubling down on another $3tln infrastructure package. With tax receipts going nowhere, the budget deficit is set to explode to record highs. Much of the debt issued to finance, this additional spending will likely be funded by the Fed. In order to do so, they will be forced to increase QE and that will probably occur at the same time that they announce explicit Yield Curve Control.

As I have  posted repeatedly, and in my prior posts, unless they are willing to allow everything to collapse, the Fed has no choice but to will allow inflation . Under such a scenario, stocks rise and bond yields stabilize or fall. At the same time, inflation expectations are likely to rise. This means that real yields are set to fall faster than nominal yields. All of which is the perfect scenario for precious metals and miners. But all of this money printing must have consequences and the likely casualty is the dollar. A weaker dollar would also contribute to higher inflation expectations. Again, great for Gold, Silver, and the mining companies. It‚Äôs just a question of when.

On the one hand, the Biden administration is clearly eager to get this next bill through Congress as fast as possible. However, Republicans are likely to choke on the amount of pork barrel spending included in the Bill. Hence, expect a little to-and-fro to slow its passage but given the Democrats control of all levels of government, I believe it will ultimately pass in one form or another in May at the latest. If so, we can finally look forward to a bottom in precious metals and miners at some point over the next couple of weeks,if not already in place.

SLR (Supplementary Leverage Ratio)

With respect to the SLR exemption that the Fed decided not to extend, the Fed did say that it would review the SLR requirements. Given the need to fund $3tln of new debt to fund the latest stimulus package, I guesstimate that the Fed is far more likely to loosen the constraints of the SLR in some way to facilitate the banks assistance in financing the biggest supply of new bonds the market has ever seen in such a short period of time. Such news, if it transpires, would also hasten the peak in the dollar and real yields and the bottom in Gold et al.

NSFR (Net Stable Funding Ratio)

Like the SLR, the NSFR is another facet of new Basel 3 regulations that are being implemented worldwide in response to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 to ensure that financial institutions have sufficient high-quality assets to weather a similar crisis in the future without having to resort to bailouts. In essence, these new regulations are designed to mitigate the risk of bankruptcies such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.

With respect to gold specifically, the  regulators will significantly penalize Bullion Banks holding Gold in unallocated accounts relative to fully allocated accounts. Unallocated means you have a ‚Äòshare‚Äô in a certain amount of Gold whereas allocated means that you own the rights to a specific amount of  gold. Unallocated gold can be leveraged, loaned out, more than once, creating multiple claims on the same amount of Gold. Allocated cannot. In other words, the Banks will be penalized for unallocated  gold holdings and rewarded for holding the actual physical metal on an unlevered basis. Simply put, it makes it expensive for the Banks to engage in Gold lending or hypothecation. Gold lending is widely considered one of the principal tools used to short Gold .Eliminating or drastically reducing this activity therefore makes it more difficult to short the metal  weather gold or silver and is therefore bullish.

This is one of many reasons why gold has been under pressure for 8 months now. In anticipation of this new regulation, Banks would clearly not want to be short the metal. They are motivated to get out of their short positions and even get long. This is what they have been trying to do since the peak in open interest in January 2020:

Open interest has now fallen to its lowest level since May 2019, when Gold hit a low of ~1269. Note that the last peak in open interest was in August 2020 and Gold has been going down ever since.

Banks loathe to take a loss on their short positions so they have been waiting for lower prices to cover these positions. They have accelerated this process since January, which is reflected in the drop in open interest since then, and are far closer to at least being neutral. Reportedly, JP Morgan is already net neutral to long. Now it‚Äôs just the remaining Bullion Banks trying to get out of their short positions ahead of the new rules to be implemented and the expected rally to begin soon.

This is just further evidence that the bottom is or close for gold and silver .

CONCLUSION

While we continue to patiently endure weakness in precious metals and miners in the short-term, even as nominal and real yields ease back from their recent peaks, the big picture continues to improve, setting us up for a truly spectacular rally to begin within the next pulpe of weeks .

Key support levels to watch on the downside and possibly ‚Äúthe lows‚Äù are 1800 and 27 in Gold and Silver respectively."

Inflation is here to stay in the USA.,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/n8v250/inflation_is_here_to_stay_in_the_usa/,francis105d1,1,2021-05-10 11:41:10,0,/r/btc/comments/n8v250/inflation_is_here_to_stay_in_the_usa/,NaN,"Inflation is here.

Have you go shopping lately for daily essential?

Have you noticed that food prices are going up?

In short, that is inflation, the increase of prices of your daily needs but your salary continues to be the same, many called it a tax. But the truth is inflation comes when a government doesn't govern itself and in a specific territory. Well many reasons can be given of why this happens, one of them is the money printing by order of the government and to the central banks.

With each country the different on how inflation starts may be different but the end result is the same, increases in the prices, in the case of Venezuela was in part because the government didn't managed its finance well and they started to spend more than what they produced, and so they started to print money in order to pay for their expanses, not to forget also United States sanctions as well against the current government in Venezuela.

In the case of United States, inflation is happening because the means of production have been stop to try to curve the health crisis, and also all the restriction that were impose to regular citizens and their businesses, in the country of the free you can't run your own business as you see fit, you must live by the government blessing otherwise you starve to death by its mandates as well.

But the one thing you can make sure is that the stimulus checks are just money printing checks and all Americans will pay that bills with interest once payment comes due, the form will be not only higher taxes but also higher prices at the store and pump. And what inflation has to do with crypto in general and even better Bitcoin Cash?

Well one thing you can be assure not without risk that Bitcoin BCH will always have 21 million total supply and it doesn't matter what happens in the real world the supply will not change, and no government or any other entity will have the power to change that and as such compare to fiat currencies Bitcoin Cash will continue to gain value against those. Even if miner some how managed to get together and change the rules of 21 millions total supply, users could just fork and continue with the current feature and miners will be left mining something that the people don't appreciate or valuate it as much, so since miner get rewarded in the asset itself it will be to their best interest to keep that rule going.

If you don't read the Bitcoin Core propaganda but instead inform yourself with independent news you will realize that in countries on which inflation and hyperinflation is a thing of the pass or that they are experiencing that situation at this moment you will find out that in those territories people are using altcoins like Litecoin, Dash, XRP and Bitcoin Cash because those altcoins the fees are very minimal.

Once hyperinflation hits the United States the same reaction will happen here as well, people will use altcoins instead of Bitcoin Core and once the United States Dollar goes the way of the Zimbabwe dollar the whole world will be in big problem not just USA. At that point many things could happen but one thing is almost guarantee, people that can't afford BTC fees won't use that currency and will have to use alternatives, and if enough people can't afford it than it becomes useless to the regular user.

And that's the risk that Bitcoin Core has, once the rich are done accumulating Core to who are they going to sell to? the rich are buying Bitcoin Core today because in the future they plan to use as a hedge against inflation and because they are expecting to sell it to those who didn't buy before the crisis, but if their future costumers can't afford the fees to who are they going to sell to? To themselves maybe?

Bitcoin is suppose to be a decentralized peer to peer currency that can bank the poor and the rich both at the same time, but the current Bitcoin project now lives on Bitcoin Cash BCH, if you want a hedge against inflation where you will be able to accumulate today and sell it tomorrow you want Bitcoin BCH. If you are accumulating Bitcoin BCH today because you want to hedge against inflation tomorrow Bitcoin BCH is what you want, and you can be sure that not only you will have a hedge but also a currency and store of value all of them at the same time, and your future costumers will be able to afford the transaction fees as well so you will be safe by holding Bitcoin Cash.

Make no mistake and you must try to understand the following, if Bitcoin which is Bitcoin BCH were to work as advertise then why would you need any other altcoins? You see that's what people don't understand yet and that's were the opportunity is, if Bitcoin BCH works and is the real Bitcoin, why would you need other altcoins. Altcoins are growing today because they are trying to close the gap that Bitcoin Core left, but Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin that actually works, and that's why is so hated, because Bitcoin BCH not only makes Bitcoin Core useless but also a whole lot of other altcoins. And people who are already invested into other altcoins don't want to lose their money, so they will fight this idea to the biter end.

Take this as an example, Vitalik the creator of Ethereum wanted to code that which ETH does today but in Bitcoin, but the Core team didn't let him so he went ahead and created his own coin, but make no mistake what eth does today was supposed to happen on btc, so let go back to bch, if Bitcoin Cash can have smart contracts and tokens and can scale on-chain because 32mb blocks and in 10 years up to 128mb, than why do you eth for? So that you understand better, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash can do the same things that eth does today and BCH will continue to improve in what eth does in the future as well, than why do you need eth for? not only that eth was supposed to be coded into Bitcoin Core but Core devs didn't let Vitalik work on BTC because of scalability issues, than if BCH can scale on-chain and it is the real Bitcoin, why do you need eth for?

Once you let Bitcoin BCH work as advertise in the white paper you don't need many of the altcoins and as such BCH will always be hated because it puts those investors in a bad place where they stand to lose everything they have gained but make no mistake this little fact will come to the masses and they will understand this as well, and so those project little by little may have a treat going their way in the form of Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin so I don't need to hold this altcoin. So you see is not about saying Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin is about the fundamentals behind that, and the people who already hold those assets don't want to hear that because they don't want to lose money, so it is up to the new investors to figure that on their own, and that's why Core is censoring you on Reddit because they don't want new comers to find out about those things until is too late and they are already invested and have to force themselves to follow that same narrative so that they don't lose their investment as well.

And what good is a store of value if you can't use it in the moment the need it the most, Bitcoin Core is an unproven store of value, no it is not an store of value just an speculation asset because in times of hyperinflation the regular people are force to use altcoins instead, if in Venezuela and Argentina, people must use other altcoins to save on fees, that means that once inflation hits your country you will have the same problem and if you were buying it as a hedge against inflation than your whole thesis is wrong, is not a hedge or store of value if people in other location with hyperinflation already can't use it. At best Bitcoin Core is an speculation asset and that will die out also once the mayor economy in the world suffers the fate of the money printing from the FED and all of the stimulus checks and bailouts.

&amp;#x200B;

You start with 1k of a stable coin of your choice and you want to deposit to a 3pool. Could you explain all the steps that happen during a period of 1 month?

&amp;#x200B;

1) How often do you get rewards?   
2) What tokens do you get as a reward?   
3) What can you do with those rewards?  
4) Should you lock all your CRV tokens? For how long? Which are the benefits?  
5) What happens when you withdraw?

"How do vehicle affordability rules-of-thumb change when looking at a high-demand, low-depreciating vehicles?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/n9419s/how_do_vehicle_affordability_rulesofthumb_change/,xCogito,1,2021-05-10 21:08:29,19,/r/personalfinance/comments/n9419s/how_do_vehicle_affordability_rulesofthumb_change/,Auto,"I'm specifically referencing Ramsey's rule that vehicle value shouldn't surpass 50% of your annual income. There were a few other rules I've run into that seem to have their foundation correlated with the steep depreciation curve in the first few years of ownership. Does this all still count with vehicles that hold resale value historically? 

In my situation, I do a lot of mountain driving in the summer and just purchased a house, so I'd like to get a pickup for projects and camping. It's hard to make the 10% takehome rule work if a sedan doesn't fit a lifestyle.  

I'm in the PNW-ish area, so the market has a hard-on for reliable AWD and mid-size pickups. By most metrics, I should only spend 25k on a vehicle with a 60-63k salary. My 25k could only get me something with 90k+ 6yr+ vehicles. Tacomas, Subarus, Canyons/Colorados all hold value into the higher mileage. There is barely any price movement for used 2016-2021 with 10k-79k miles. They all seem to move within $5k-$6k regardless.

I'm eyeing a truck with 11k miles on it that is 5k under market (truly a great deal), but still at 40k. There's nothing close to the package selling under 48k for models 1 year older with 2x-3x mileage and lesser features. I'd be looking to finance around 35k. Monthly auto expenses with insurance/gas would be roughly 20% of my take-home.


**TL;DR**

Is there flexibility to account for in these situations where depreciation isn't really a factor/concern? Or is my caveman brain just trying to justify a bad financial decision?"
How crypto can change the world: from replacing Binance to getting rid of Nestl√©.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n94u0d/how_crypto_can_change_the_world_from_replacing/,chomskian1,1,2021-05-10 21:47:19,44,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n94u0d/how_crypto_can_change_the_world_from_replacing/,EXCHANGE," I always wondered which would be the next technological revolution. From the steam engine, to television, the internet, or smartphones, there are times in which a technological invention disrupts everything, changing human life forever and having deep and complex economic, social and cultural implications. Given how early in the [Rogers Adoption Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle) for Crypto we are, I would like to take a moment so we can just imagine what this technological revolution, which I consider is the next huge step for human kind, could bring. I will emphasize some socioeconomic implications of descentralization, but I\`m mostly interested in listening to, and debating your inputs.

Blockchain and Crypto Currency are here to change the world forever.

&amp;#x200B;

**The implications of decentralization**

As you may know one of the core proposals of blockchain is decentralization, and with it we can optimize so many processes that this alone could be the revolution we are talking about. By eliminating intermediaries, we can save on the cost they add to the supply chain ensuring those that create the value, keep it. Or we can simply save on fees.

To quote the man himself:

*Whereas most technologies tend to automate workers on the periphery doing menial tasks, blockchains automate away the center. Instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts Uber out of a job and lets the taxi drivers work with the customer directly. ‚Äì Vitalik Buterin.*

To put it simply, imagine that you replace Binance (a centralized company) with a robot. A robot that you have programed so well, whose code you publicly audit, and that is so safe you can trust it with billions of dollars in liquidity pools, so it can host and operate the trading platform by itself. In case you didn‚Äôt know, this is already a reality! Many people here trade on those platforms on a daily basis. 

But this goes beyond replacing Centralized Exchanges with [Automated Market Makers](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/amm-what-are-automated-market-makers), Airbnb with a blockchain DApp that connects landlords and costumers, or even banks with complex smart contracts that allow you to borrow, save, tokenize physical assets, and so on. This goes way beyond.

Here is where I start to fantasize of the future. Think about replacing capital itself, think about getting rid of corporations. Lets dream of a world with [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization)s massive adoption.

With DeFi, we may no longer need a company like Nestl√©‚Ä¶

And specially not their investors. Of course, you will still need the people administrating, planning, monitoring, generating new ideas that adapt to their context, and creating innovative solutions for a complex world only humans can comprehend. But the figure of shareholders and CEOs that steal all the value that workers create and leave them with a tiny fraction of it, can disappear. This can be the basis of a once in a century transformation.

Just as an example: Nestl√®‚Äôs coffee growers in Colombia keep less than 10% of the final sale price, and barely make a living on it, so are actually abandoning the rural areas.

With Blockchain, DeFi and Smart Contracts, people like you and me can collectively fund such an operation, and then agree upon specific terms like wages by direct democracy, voting with our crypto holdings. Then we would proceed to allocate funds, hire ‚Äúdevelopers‚Äù which would ultimately be regular office jobs that keep the organization functioning. Once in operation we would frequently vote on decisions and results, which would ultimately keep the highest level of accountability for people working in the organization. This is already happening by the way, this is how some blockchain projects work today. We just haven‚Äôt applied it to industrial and physical supply chains yet.

Let‚Äôs go back to our project to replace Nestle. Imagine that an organization‚Äôs main goal is not to maximize profits for shareholders and bonuses for CEOs anymore. Instead, it‚Äôs the interest of regular people and the company‚Äôs collaborators that drive its actions.

Most likely, you and I will want to consolidate an efficient and effective supply chain, that is sustainable and keeps the dignity and wellbeing of its collaborators as a guiding principle. We are not longer at their mercy on issues like climate change, we can now take immediate action against it, or stop endangering and hoarding water supplies in classic Nestle fashion.

Also, we are making profits, so we are redistributing capital, and improving our quality of life, which will be most notorious in the most vulnerable communities, usually those that extract/harvest/mine raw materials. 

This is what could happen with the blockchain descentralization of business. And you could apply it to pretty much anything, but maybe initially it could be for low labor and capital intensive businesses. 

I‚Äôll give you another example. I work for a solar power multinational company. If you don‚Äôt know it, solar energy is essentially a financial product, most people working in these companies don‚Äôt care about the world, its simply that solar is a very safe and lucrative hustle, and all investors care about is having a nice return of investment (ROI). As of now, my company works exclusively for large scale corporate clients or the state itself, given that‚Äôs where the nice ROIs are, since they give you the projects that allow you to place large capitals at once. This means, as of today, we blatantly ignore the regular people that seek for our help and funding to power their farms and/or houses with solar energy. They‚Äôre not that profitable my boss tells me. This is shitty, and I‚Äôve thought of quitting several times.

But back to the point. Now, imagine once again, we get rid of the institutional investors. Now you and me create Reddit Solar Co, a DAO. Our only purpose is to facilitate access to electricity those without it, and to advance in the urban implementation of renewable energy. We help the world, make dividends that are automatically distributed by the DAO, and also our own Crypto is rising in value. 

And this is not the best.

&amp;#x200B;

**Let‚Äôs not forget about synergies.**

So, we just created a DAO that manufactures and distributes food globally right? Or maybe Reddit Solar Co. As an organization born on the blockchain, we won‚Äôt have to adapt to the state of the art innovations on the crypto world like an old steam locomotive attempting to adapt a warp drive on top of it. We were born in space.

From the beginning, our Ethereum based DAO could adopt VeChain‚Äôs solution for supply chains, Cardano will help us to give an integral solution to the unbanked communities that provide our raw material, they now have IDs, access to DeFi and education. The land deeds and legal documents that relate to our enterprise are certified by LTO Network, we move money internationally with XRP or Stellar, and don‚Äôt worry, we use Polkadot to ensure proper blockchain interoperability. 

Too complex for you? Don‚Äôt worry, you don‚Äôt even have to know or care about this, leave that to others. You‚Äôre into finance. Maybe sales is your thing and there‚Äôs a little Michael Scott in you. Or you\`re into social work and want to supervise our community engagement at the start of the supply chain. Just go do your thing! You don‚Äôt necessarily have to be involved in all of this.

All you know is you do your job and receive your crypto salary.

Just as computers and the internet changed the world forever, and not only had economic implications but also changed our culture, routines, work lives and ways to interact with each other, crypto will. We are just so early; that all we can do for now is dream.

&amp;#x200B;

**You‚Äôre having too much hope in humanity dude‚Ä¶**

Sure, I may be making some optimistic assumptions on the motivations of people, I may be saying that we will use this technology for good, and that we care about each other, and that‚Äôs one way to look at it. But we could also argue in favor of this from a sceptic perspective: even if you don‚Äôt care about the collective wellbeing of your community, it‚Äôs in your best nterest to live in a safer environment right? Ergo you want to reduce poverty. Its also in your interest to stop global warming so organized human life can continue to exist, or to make sure you and your children will have water and food in 50 years, that‚Äôs why you will want to use technology for good even if you only care about yourself. Also lets not forget the powerful incentive of profits. Crypto has the clear potential to achieve all of this.

Most of the current generation of crypto projects will be ready and operating within the next 3 years, so all we will need by then is the will to use this technology for good, and the vision to change the world. Getting rid of Binance and Nestl√© is just a step, what matters is what those new organizations will do for all of us.

This is just the beginning, we will be killing industries, but giving birth to others we could have never imagined before.

Hosted by **The Cat,** head admin of BitboyCrypto.

Rodrigo Silva, the CEO of Munch, answered questions alongside Mike Si, the Strategy Advisor.

Spelling/grammatical issues in the transcription have been corrected and unnecessary messages have been omitted.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;
***

**The Cat:** Welcome Munch team u/rodresendesilva and u/MS3081 to our AMA. We are happy to have you! Can you tell us a bit about the Munch project and what your goal is? As well as a bit about your guy's background and previous experience?

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cat**: I apologize I do have one thing to address before we begin. This AMA doesn't constitute a partnership with Bitboy Crypto. It is only a question-and-answer session. I have to say that due to tweets that went out from Munch stating this was a formal partnership.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cat:** This AMA is not investment advice, and is meant to further educate the audience on projects to aid in DYOR (Doing your own research.) With that out of the way. Now let's begin!

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** HI Cat and hello everyone in the channel, it is a pleasure to be here and being given the opportunity to talk about our project.

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Rodrigo and I'm a Portuguese living in London for the past 7 years. My background is in computer science, I moved to London to work as a developer and things escalated to the point where I created my own company. Since then, I've been dedicated to develop products from scratch and take them to market.

$MUNCH was born from other charitable tokens that I invested in, I really liked the idea and certainly, they had a 'feel-good feeling, which I loved. I spent some time analyzing the flaws of previous tokens and decided to create a token that would have a trustless donation system, where people wouldn't have to trust the developers to actually donate the funds received on their wallets.

We also decided that the timing was better than ever due to the current state of the world, it would be nice to have something that brings people together to help the ones in need.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mike Si:** Hi everyone, a pleasure to be here, and thanks for hosting u/JustAC4t. I'm Mike, Co-founder of Munch Project. We are a unique charity de-fi project that gives back to our community and society. In under 4 weeks, we have donated over $2.2 million, in ether, to Givewell charity. Setting a record for any crypto charity project.

We are supported by an amazing and passionate Munch community.

On a personal note, I currently lead strategy, marketing, and growth for Munch. Me and Rodrigo are good friends and I was convinced by his vision of building something that makes a real lasting impact. Prior to Munch, I'm a startup advisor, investor and have lead multiple product and development teams at global companies such as Barclays and American Express, and scaled growth at fintech unicorn companies ($1bn +) such as Curve and Monese.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** Let me personally apologize for that, those tweets were lost in translation and $MUNCH is known for the transparency we deal with the community, hence never intended to make any false claims

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cat:** Understand just had to address that. Can you tell our audience a bit about how the project works?

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva**: Our project is an ERC20 token that charges a fee on each transaction (currently 10%, but decided by the community). From that fee, 5% reverts back to the holders and the remaining 5% are donated to the charity wallet in Ethereum.

Many people don't know, but the contract itself is an address, therefore capable of holding any kind of token. So what we did was, on each transaction, the charity fee is held in the contract itself and remains there up to a certain threshold, when that threshold is reached, we communicate with the Uniswap's router and perform the swap of our tokens for Ethereum and simultaneously send them to the charity wallet.

This has many advantages:

\- The swap never affects the price of the coin, because only a small portion of the transactions gets converted to ETH. This makes our coin stable

\- This is an automatic process and we don't have any control over it, so there's no market manipulation by making the price drop

\- This is trustless because when the transactions are done by the contract, they can be checked within the contract's internal transactions section. People can easily match the address receiving Ethereum with the address on GiveWell's website in this case

\- Last but not least, by performing the swap automatically, we don't hold the value to donate in $MUNCH, so the amount is much less volatile

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cat:** Okay so I would like you to address something for me. According to the audit of your project, the owner of the contract can exclude and include users from transfer fees, update the maximum transaction amount, update the fee percentages and update how the fees are allocated. Why is so much power being given to the contract owner and who owns the contract and has all that power? Would you be willing to update this, and lock liquidity longer to ease these concerns? I will say besides my concerns this is a very interesting model and that is what attracted me to Munch was the large donation you gave to Givewell.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** Very good question. I own the contract and currently am the person with that power.

We do need to have that power exactly to provide the options that we're claiming. So let's address it one by one:

\- ""the owner of the contract can exclude and include users from transfer fees""

We need to do this because we have roughly 23% of the tokens locked. It was going to be initially for burning events, but we had to adapt and save some aside for liquidity, exchange fees, and marketing. Locking these tokens means that they have to move back and forth from our wallet to the contract. Due to our current tokenomics, that would mean that 10% of each transaction would be both retained by the contract and donated (the huge amount that would be taken of the liquidity) and redistributed. To summarise, we needed to be able to exclude the burning wallet and lock contract from fees.

\-""update the maximum transaction amount""

This is pretty standard on contracts and was used to prevent huge purchases in the beginning as whales can ruin your project. That can be consulted and you'll see that the maximum transaction amount is now the supply.

\-""update the fee percentages and update how the fees are allocated""

This is exactly because we want to give our users the power of choice. Currently, a 10% fee works great, the rewards and donations are fantastic... but in the future, we will need to adapt to a more sustainable business model, when the daily volume goes up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** Currently liquidity is locked for 6 months and we're willing to lock for us long as the community want. We initially didn't lock it for longer in case that was the need to change to Uniswap V3 which is in fact, another liquidity pool

Just to add to that, we are not perfect but aim to constantly improve and our community is amazing and bright... they've been doing a good job keeping us on our toes and we do listen to them actively. So yes, we're willing to always do what works better for everyone

It was GiveWell's largest donation ever in crypto, hope we will have the opportunity to develop on this later on

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cat:** On the flip side of the argument though you can essentially just block any user from moving funds. That's why I had to ask you and have you address that concern.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** Absolutely not, I can exclude a user from paying fees, I cannot block anyone from transferring funds

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cat:** Makes sense would you be willing to lock a larger amount of liquidity if it meant doors opened for your project?

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** Absolutely, as said, we locked the liquidity of what was pooled on Uniswap, which was 45% of the total supply

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cat:** Yes my concerns regarding the contract have been addressed. Tell us a bit more about the Givewell donation and how the whole event transpired?

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** Great thanks! We had everything ready to launch the project and the charity was being a bit challenging, we wanted to cause a more local impact initially because we were small and never thought of being able to donate anywhere close to 2M in three weeks. With that said, most parts of the small charities are not crypto ready so we needed to select a charity that obeyed these two criteria:

\- Have a static Ethereum address (because of our contract, if it changes on every transaction we will only donate once)

\- That address needed to be publicly visible for everyone to be able to match with our internal transactions

We did a bit of research and found that GiveWell was the perfect candidate because they're not a simple charity, they carry on extensive research and make sure that the funds are applied where they most needed. For example, donation for the malaria cause might not be as effective at certain times of the year (not accurate, just for example purposes).

The other aspect was that, due to this research, they would actually be able to share some numbers with us and we thought that it would be amazing to share that with the community... in our case, and can be consulted on GiveWell's impact calculator, we know that our 2M donation will save up to 666 lives, a number like that certainly has an impact

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cat:** Might want to donate a few more dollars just to save more lives than the number of the beast.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mike Si**: I'd like to emphasize the community-driven aspect of our charitable donations; we intend to move towards a model that  allows our community members to vote for new charities on a bi-monthly basis provided that they meet have stringent vetting requirements

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** Mate I was actually thinking of that right now but it's actually on their website 400-666

&amp;#x200B;

**Mike Si**: We look at financial efficiency, track record of the charity, how they allocate their funds, the credibility of the team, etc., and of course, having a fully transparent public wallet address so that any donations can be fully audited.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cat:** So is Munch registered as a 501C3 company, or how is that treated as you are allowing donations to charities and technically you would be the vehicle for donation through your platform?

The charities will be vetted that Munch supports? How will this vetting take place, do you have anyone who works with charities to do this vetting?

&amp;#x200B;

**Mike Si:** At the moment we are not registered as a 501C3 company, we started as a community project and experiment with a goal to rally the crypto community to distribute its wealth to good causes. Since we've started just over 3 weeks ago, we've been absolutely blown away by the traction and impact Munch and its community were able to make. With our power to donate over $2million per month towards charitable causes, we are now increasingly cognizant of our responsibility as a trusted entity. We are looking at options in the coming weeks to establish an appropriate legal status to maximize the credibility and long-term impact the Munch project can bring.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cat:** Happy to hear it guys, after that is finalized make sure to reach out to me and ill help connect the project all around. I wish you the best of success, 2 million per month is a lot even 1 million is more than enough for those in need. But the more people we can all help the happier the world we can all share.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cat:** Is there anything more you would like to highlight? I believe you had an announcement and typical tradition here, is you give the Bitsquad a preview of what you are working on? So have at it!

&amp;#x200B;

**Mike Si:** We appreciate your support u/JustAC4t. and I will take you up on that offer in due course ;)

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** Thanks for that the Cat, we will certainly be reaching out to you and to everyone who's willing to help us further expanding our reach, impact, and usability

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** Mike, want to do the honors? :)

&amp;#x200B;

**Mike Si:** Sure

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** Michael will give the non-technical updates and I'll jump in for the nerdy stuff

&amp;#x200B;

**Mike Si:** First of all, I want to give the Munch and Bitsquad community a quick check-in on key milestones. Smashing donation targets is great, but the team has been working diligently to execute our near term roadmap:

\- New website V2 will be ready before the end of the month

\- Binance bridge is in development - we appreciate all the feedback from users that want to purchase Munch on BSC so we are making this our top priority.

\- Voting/governance web app - development complete. Now in testing.

\- Charity launchpad - architecture and design work is progressing extremely well.

\- Exchange listings - we've engaged 3 exchanges so far and meet the requirements from key exchanges including project credibility, financials, trading volume, community interest etc.

Lastly, we've designed a little surprise initiative to reward our Munch holders and future holders that I will share with you all now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** To add to that, we had a lot of questions so, here are some timelines:

\- binance bridge will be complete in 2-3 weeks

\- voting/governance portal will be live next week

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cat:** That reminds me I wanted to discuss what is a ""charity launchpad"" can you explain how this will work? What will voting and governance entail for users?

&amp;#x200B;

**Mike Si:** We are excited to announce the MUNCH Millions Lottery Draw! As part of our mission to make money work better for everyone, we want to introduce our weekly lottery draw that allows holders of MUNCH to be entered automatically, and the rules of the game are simple:

\- hold at least $100 worth of $MUNCH for 7 days

\- have not sold for the past 7 days

\- $250 $MUNCH prize for one lucky winner, twice a week (Tuesday and Friday)

\- every $1m we donate or other key milestones we hit, we‚Äôd quadruple the pot for both prizes that week meaning $1000 Munch tokens per lucky winner!

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** Currently, our contract allows for the funds to be donated to only one cause at a time. To further improve the utilization of our token, we decided to create a charity launchpad, that will allow users to choose the causes to support.

Think of it as a ""go fund me"" for charities. They will be able to apply to be featured on the platform and users will be able to select the charities to support by staking their tokens.

The idea here is to then bring everything together and create this portal where users can:

\- Check personal stats (rewards, donations, etc)

\- Vote for the causes to support

\- Vote for core features such as fees and allocation of the fees

\- Participate in corporate-level decisions in the future

\- Stake their tokens and support the causes individually

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cat:** Will this also be only vetted charities on the launch pad?

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** Absolutely and we will have people full-time to do that. This is basically to be able to microfinance charities and social projects.

In the future, the vision is also to deliver ""crypto as a service"" for charities, because as I mentioned in the beginning, the problem for us to find a charity was that they weren't crypto ready. We want to be the entity that sets up these wallets for them, therefore enabling all the charities to benefit from our model

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cat:** Sounds very awesome and would help a lot of people out.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cat:** The project sounds exciting guys and like I said once you have the organization in place, ill be happy to open doors for you and connect you to people, other projects, and organizations. Thanks for the AMA. I am going to be opening the floodgates now for user questions. Are you ready? üòâ

&amp;#x200B;

**Mike Si:** I want to add to Rod's point above that although the initial and primary use case of the launchpad is for supporting social and individual causes, we envisage this to also help newer crypto projects and aspiring project founders too. We were fortunate to have scaled so quickly over just 3 weeks but we know it can be a true pain point for incredibly talented crypto teams to raise finance. So a future launchpad use case is to decentralize finance raising - we'll provide the platform for high potential, early-stage crypto projects to fundraise, and also give our community members a chance to participate in early-stage investing at a real chance of wealth creation. Essentially broadening our use case to supporting IDOs.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cat:** Ahhh very interesting, and ill take it all teams and projects on the IDOs will also be as vetted and scrutinized as charities are, right?

&amp;#x200B;

**Mike Si:** absolutely :)

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** Happy for you to open the gates Cat :)

&amp;#x200B;

**S Turner:** What is the meaning of Your project? Why do you think that this name made sense for your project? Kindly describe in details

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** I like to talk about this. When we came up with a charity token, we went to google analytics to discover what were the most affected causes in the world and we found out that was hunger. Initially, our focus was going to be hunger-related charities so we decided to call it $MUNCH, because it was a funny name and it's an English expression for chewing :)

&amp;#x200B;

**Alienhjin:** What was the greatest achievement of your project since it has started? What do you want more to solve and achieve in the world of NFT?

&amp;#x200B;

**Mike Si:** I'll answer this one. The greatest achievement to date is seeing the massive impact our Munch community has made in support real problems and causes, in just 3-4 weeks. What started as a small experiment quickly turned into a movement that is changing the entire crypto and charity landscape. NFT is an interesting area in the crypto space, and we are in talks with partners currently to explore various ideas. For instance,  we have an incredibly creative community and want to enable them to auction their artwork to reward them as artists, and to donate part of the proceeds to charity.

&amp;#x200B;

**Nathan:** Where can I see the information about your team members? How can I be sure that they are enough qualified to drive this project for the long term?

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** Hi, you can see everything related to our project on our website: [munchtoken.com](https://munchtoken.com)

Regarding us being qualified, we have a very diverse team with different backgrounds. We have proven experience when it comes to:

\- Managing companies

\- Developing products

\- Scaling existing companies

\- Architecting and developing technical solutions

\- Marketing and communications

What we don't have, you can certainly find within our community and that's the biggest advantage of running a community project. You wouldn't be able to afford all the help we're given for free ‚ù§Ô∏è

&amp;#x200B;

**AGI Prophet:** Can you talk more about the DeFi aspect of $MUNCH? How is passive income appealing to people?

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** We want to encourage long-term holding, to achieve that we believed that we needed both a strong vision and sexy tokenomics. Just by holding our token, you'll be getting a percentage of all the transactions, the bigger your holdings, the bigger the percentage you'll get.

The passive income on our project has been so good that we were approached by holders wanting to donate their earnings to charity.

Also important to mention that the burning address will also hold 15% of the total circulation supply, following our distribution model, this will make us deflationary.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dulkar Harmobi:** Do you plan for BSC or polkadot in future? Do have plans to add your project to various blockchains in the future?

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** Polkadot is not excluded, but we need to further analyze. As of now, we do want to exist both on Binance and Ethereum networks and as mentioned, this is now very close to become reality.

Important to mention that our supply won't duplicate, tokens will be frozen in the bridge when swapped from ERC20 to BEP20.

&amp;#x200B;

**‚ú® CRYPTONECO üëÄ:** Many projects only talk about their strengths. Can you tell us honestly about the weaknesses of your project? And how does your project address this weakness?

&amp;#x200B;

**Mike Si:** Whilst Munch has been growing exponentially over the past 3 weeks and smashing records, it's been a challenge having to scale a project and community so quickly and we have to constantly adapt to the market, project stage, community, and competition. I'll cite one example in our marketing efforts. We've initially allocated a modest 5% marketing budget as we never would have imagined Munch will scale so big and so quickly. We were at first very conservative with marketing, but since ramping up our efforts we've seen tremendous growth whereby our Twitter presence increased by 1000%, telegram increased by 400% and holders grew by 120%+ in the past 11 days. We've also recognized the need to move very fast to maintain our first-mover advantage, as we seen a number of projects try to imitate us from tokenomics, a roadmap to the overall strategy. To solve this, we've decided to consult with the community and made the decision to reallocate a portion of burn wallet funds to expedite marketing, exchange listings, and future development efforts. With this new decision, Munch is now in an extremely strong position to double down on growth plans that have worked out well and to also stay ahead of schedule with executing some of the things our community has asked for - including Binance bridge and new exchanges.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mike Si:** As promised, I want to share with the BitQquad and munch community our latest video that represents what Munch Project stands for ‚ù§Ô∏è. Special thanks to the core team for creating this and also our community members for voting for the best voiceover! 

&amp;#x200B;

**Rodrigo Silva:** Thanks you all for your time and for this amazing opportunity to talk about a project we're so passionate about. Let's continue to build this together... help others whilst having fun and profiting from it! ‚ù§Ô∏è MUNCH love

&amp;#x200B;

Can I stay in my current role as a contractor? How can I present this in a way that's appealing to my boss?,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/n9jiwx/can_i_stay_in_my_current_role_as_a_contractor_how/,dear_jelly,1,2021-05-11 07:42:24,0,/r/careerguidance/comments/n9jiwx/can_i_stay_in_my_current_role_as_a_contractor_how/,NaN," Hey guys,

I hope you might be able to give me some clarity. I am currently employed at a small software company as a Marketing Associate. I've been here for almost 2 years and even though I'm in my late 20s this has been my first fulltime job that I've lasted for over a year. I was really insecure about this in the past, but I'm just super grateful for this company for helping me get past it.

I moved from the East Coast where I found the work culture was really challenging. It may have been due to my age or working in short term focused marketing agencies, I'm sure a big part of it was me being resistant to it. Probably a combination. I do think I have matured after moving cross country. I did my MBA just prior so that I could move with a fresh slate.

Thankfully I was able to find my role within a month of moving. And I was really accepted into the company's ""family"". The ownership even invited me to family their Christmas dinner my first year here. :') They are incredibly kind and loyal to their employees and very rarely does anyone quit or is let go.

My current role has a really low work load so I am not too occupied or challenged. The person before me had even quit for the reason that there wasn't enough work.

My boss is in line to take over the company and I help him communicate with his sister who has an agency that we outsource some work to. They have a weird relationship so I stay neutral and as I mentioned am a line of communication for them. I am not very passionate about the industry or my marketing function particularly, but this job has given me the opportunity to have peace of mind financially for the first time in my life.

However, I haven't felt challenged much in the past year. Perhaps part of it is due to being out of the office and not overhearing conversations which I could eventually assimilate into knowledge. There were times when I would try my best to create a piece of content or do a video interview with a client, but these would just die and not get much circulation. I didn't get much feedback but I do think my boss is a bit of a covert perfectionist so that's why we've been delaying some videos/campaigns for months.

So I was prompted to start applying to new roles and really quickly went through an interview process and was offered a job that is a 50% higher salary and double the vacation within the financial services industry. Structurally it seems like it would be a similar role where I'm working with sr management / ownership, however I'd have 3 people to be accountable to instead of 1. I assume it'll be at least 3x the workload or so.

My dream is to be in business for myself in the next 5 to 10 years. I can't see myself working for a company for decades. I have lots to learn from both places, but would certainly have a steeper learning curve in the finance role right now.

I'm really sad to leave my job and would be pretty bummed to leave now that we a few campaigns in process. I am the only person in the marketing department at both roles. I see it as I have 4 / 5 options.

I could resign and accept the new job.

I could decline the new job.

I could accept the new job and not tell my employer and try to manage 2 jobs ( I don't know if it's possible, probably but not worth my mental health)

I could accept the new job and present the option of being a part time contractor to my boss.

I would be really happy if we could continue our working relationship at my current company, but I am definitely ready for a change.

I would love to hear from you if you have any thoughts or advice.

tl;dr  
I was presented an offer that I don't want to refuse, but I don't necessarily want to quit my job. Can I stay on as a contractor?

Thank you for listening and for any advice."
DD on SeaScape.Network: strong potential to gain x30 over the next 8 weeks?,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallcapcoins/comments/n9nh17/dd_on_seascapenetwork_strong_potential_to_gain/,Infamous_Sympathy_91,1,2021-05-11 11:10:01,1,/r/smallcapcoins/comments/n9nh17/dd_on_seascapenetwork_strong_potential_to_gain/,NaN,"On February 3rd 2021, I predicted that Audius, at $0.226 with a market cap of $27m would x20, 8 weeks later, Audius hit an ATH of $4.99 with a market cap of $580m. That post is given below and everything is documented and verifiable in time.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/lc0voc/audiousdt\_potential\_to\_pump\_20x/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/lc0voc/audiousdt_potential_to_pump_20x/)

My next prediction is Seascape, and the market cap is just $30m rn, very similar to Audius, however, in contrast to Audius, the networking effects are arguably 'stickier' and more significant within the game developer space than in the music artist space which Audius targeted. It's listed on 4 exchanges including Kucoin, with Binance tipped to be the next (as an investor in this project). Check it out here:

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crowns](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crowns)

[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/crowns/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/crowns/)

The same deep learning bot used to identify Audius identified Seascape as a prime candidate set to experience organic exceptionally outsized gains over the coming months.

**Fundamental Analysis**

**Investors:** Binance, LD Capital, Paka, Spark Digital Capital, Nabais Capital, M6, DU Capital, JRR Capital.

**Partners:** Chainlink, Moonbeam, Opensea, Maker, Binance Smart Chain, Matic and Treasureland.

Seascape seeks to become the STEAM game distribution platform for DeFi and this is a much more realistic proposition than becoming a massive AAA-game developer such as the Activision of DeFi, indeed, we are years away from seeing anything like that. Like Audius, this is a coin with a website that the GENERAL PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND with a product that can be used now, granted they only have a few games, they are developing their blockchain to make it very cost effective and scalable for much bigger game titles to use them as their **in-game coin economy** partner, making Seascape a great choice even if a game developer has much better distribution than Seascape now (which would only help Seascape further market itself).

Fundamentally, Seascape is an **in-game economy technology partner first and foremost. They are doing the hard stuff, unlike Ultra, so that they later this year become THE distribution partner of choice for DeFi game titles.** Ultra is basically Steam with tokens with a few big name game developers using them as first movers focused on marketing and player incentives, and hit an ATH of around $250m market cap. Seascape can do what Ultra does in a **much** more powerful way using their current technology AND Seascape intends to build out much more intensive player incentivisation than those Ultra has on offer now, so in terms of market cap, Seascape has the fundamentals to exceed Ultra by a factor of at least x3. Seascape has the fundamentals to exceed Ultra by a factor of at least x3. Price target is $750 is 8-12 weeks.

I also have contacts at Supercell (who made the great Clash of Clans) and I will hook these guys up. I spent many days talking to the founder of Seascape and drilled him for information and believe they are on the right track for stellar growth. Moreover, Seascape's IDO platform for launching new games will be released soon so CWS holders will **automatically** **become** **investors in an entire defi games industry** that will be built on top of the Seascape network, much of the token release schedule is focused on growing that so the inflation effects of new token release should be more than mitigated by their use in supporting this new gaming industry sector which could be worth billions.

[CWS = Prime HODL Token](https://preview.redd.it/jbvy34c7rey61.jpg?width=1112&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0047a41b58ad6e384df15593902831da272a7a34)

**Seascape and NFTs:** 30,000 Seascape gaming NFTs have been minted on the BSC and millions of dollars dropped to users through their LP mining game. Increase in its NFT economy alone could add an extra $50m-$100m to its mcap over the next couple months.

**Whitepaper:**

[https://f2be4719-641d-430b-92d5-747132d8c9bd.filesusr.com/ugd/061436\_2d3e0cc2c8cc41a0a42e3cc2d57c7e3e.pdf](https://f2be4719-641d-430b-92d5-747132d8c9bd.filesusr.com/ugd/061436_2d3e0cc2c8cc41a0a42e3cc2d57c7e3e.pdf)

**Remember**: this is a Reddit post, it is NOT financial advice, dispense your loads where ever you wish after doing your own DD and research and maybe throwing a dart at a wall. YOLO. I'm in for around 2,000 CWS held right now.

**Notes:**

pCWS is the bridged version of CWS (the currency of Seascape on ETH) on BSC (Binance Smart Chain). Users can bridge from ETH to BSC using poly.network bridge. 1 CWS = 1 pCWS as they are completely interchangeable. Here's a walk-through of Polybridge: [https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1](https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1)

**High number of coins in a few wallets:**

Audius had a similar position where 84% of coins were held in 2 wallets. Seascape's token release schedule is structured to cause growth in their ecosystem and corresponding growth in their price to mitigate future inflation effects. Essentially new games will be backed by newly released CWS acting as collateral for newly minted game coin economies generated on the Seascape blockchain. This means, as a new game grows its user base and its in game economy grows in value, those additionally released CWS should in effect pay for themselves mitigating inflation effects. Interestingly, Audius had a similar reason for releasing new coins, i.e. to attract new artists, and it grew from $27m mcap to an ath of $580m.

**KEY FEATURES:**

* Any game released on the Seascape Platform will have the option to create their own blockchain with its own set of rules.¬†
* Decentralized cross-chain bonding curve market to allow seamless price discovery of digital assets for users and projects
* User-facing game store built with DeFi in mind. Any user can serve as a PoS validator. Monthly gamepasses for users, no fees for game devs.
* Implement gamified aspects of DeFi and traditional finance into games as part of core gameplay. In-game staking, CDP's and more!¬†

DD on SeaScape.Network: building the platform for an entirely new games industry.,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallcapcoins/comments/n9nq9v/dd_on_seascapenetwork_building_the_platform_for/,Infamous_Sympathy_91,1,2021-05-11 11:24:16,22,/r/smallcapcoins/comments/n9nq9v/dd_on_seascapenetwork_building_the_platform_for/,NaN,"On February 3rd 2021, I predicted that Audius, at $0.226 with a market cap of $27m would x20, 8 weeks later, Audius hit an ATH of $4.99 with a market cap of $580m. That post is given below and everything is documented and verifiable in time.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/lc0voc/audiousdt\_potential\_to\_pump\_20x/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/lc0voc/audiousdt_potential_to_pump_20x/)

My next prediction is Seascape, and the market cap is just $30m rn, very similar to Audius, however, in contrast to Audius, the networking effects are arguably 'stickier' and more significant within the game developer space than in the music artist space which Audius targeted. It's listed on 4 exchanges including Kucoin, with Binance tipped to be the next (as an investor in this project). **No prediction multiple allowed in this sub so DYOR and work one out for yourself.** Check it out here:

[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/crowns/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/crowns/)

The same deep learning bot used to identify Audius identified Seascape as a prime candidate set to experience organic exceptionally outsized gains over the coming months.

**Fundamental Analysis**

**Investors:** Binance, LD Capital, Paka, Spark Digital Capital, Nabais Capital, M6, DU Capital, JRR Capital.

**Partners:** Chainlink, Moonbeam, Opensea, Maker, Binance Smart Chain, Matic and Treasureland.

Seascape seeks to become the STEAM game distribution platform for DeFi and this is a much more realistic proposition than becoming a massive AAA-game developer such as the Activision of DeFi, indeed, we are years away from seeing anything like that. Like Audius, this is a coin with a website that the GENERAL PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND with a product that can be used now, granted they only have a few games, they are developing their blockchain to make it very cost effective and scalable for much bigger game titles to use them as their **in-game coin economy** partner, making Seascape a great choice even if a game developer has much better distribution than Seascape now (which would only help Seascape further market itself).

Fundamentally, Seascape is an **in-game economy technology partner first and foremost. They are doing the hard stuff, unlike Ultra, so that they later this year become THE distribution partner of choice for DeFi game titles.** Ultra is basically Steam with tokens with a few big name game developers using them as first movers focused on marketing and player incentives, and hit an ATH of around $250m market cap. Seascape can do what Ultra does in a **much** more powerful way using their current technology AND Seascape intends to build out much more intensive player incentivisation than those Ultra has on offer now, so in terms of market cap, Seascape has the fundamentals to exceed Ultra significantly in market cap.

I also have contacts at Supercell (who made the great Clash of Clans) and I will hook these guys up. I spent many days talking to the founder of Seascape and drilled him for information and believe they are on the right track for stellar growth. Moreover, Seascape's IDO platform for launching new games will be released soon so CWS holders will **automatically** **become** **investors in an entire defi games industry** that will be built on top of the Seascape network, much of the token release schedule is focused on growing that so the inflation effects of new token release should be more than mitigated by their use in supporting this new gaming industry sector which could be worth billions.

**Seascape and NFTs:** 30,000 Seascape gaming NFTs have been minted on the BSC and millions of dollars dropped to users through their LP mining game. Increase in its NFT economy alone could add an extra $50m-$100m to its mcap over the next couple months.

**Whitepaper:**

**Remember**: this is a Reddit post, it is NOT financial advice, dispense your loads where ever you wish after doing your own DD and research and maybe throwing a dart at a wall. YOLO. I'm in for around 2,000 CWS held right now.

**Notes:**

pCWS is the bridged version of CWS (the currency of Seascape on ETH) on BSC (Binance Smart Chain). Users can bridge from ETH to BSC using poly.network bridge. 1 CWS = 1 pCWS as they are completely interchangeable. Here's a walk-through of Polybridge: [https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1](https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1)

**High number of coins in a few wallets:**

Audius had a similar position where 84% of coins were held in 2 wallets. Seascape's token release schedule is structured to cause growth in their ecosystem and corresponding growth in their price to mitigate future inflation effects. Essentially new games will be backed by newly released CWS acting as collateral for newly minted game coin economies generated on the Seascape blockchain. This means, as a new game grows its user base and its in game economy grows in value, those additionally released CWS should in effect pay for themselves mitigating inflation effects. Interestingly, Audius had a similar reason for releasing new coins, i.e. to attract new artists, and it grew from $27m mcap to an ath of $580m.

**KEY FEATURES:**

* Any game released on the Seascape Platform will have the option to create their own blockchain with its own set of rules.¬†
* Decentralized cross-chain bonding curve market to allow seamless price discovery of digital assets for users and projects
* User-facing game store built with DeFi in mind. Any user can serve as a PoS validator. Monthly gamepasses for users, no fees for game devs.
* Implement gamified aspects of DeFi and traditional finance into games as part of core gameplay. In-game staking, CDP's and more!¬†

How do APY and reward works?,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/n9qlnv/how_do_apy_and_reward_works/,StErMi87,1,2021-05-11 14:31:31,1,/r/defi/comments/n9qlnv/how_do_apy_and_reward_works/,NaN,"I have started learning Defi, read a lot of blog posts, watched videos but I still need to understand some basic concepts that I would rather not learn the hard way (using the pool). 

So here we go with some questions, hoping that these are some common questions to ask. Let's take the most complex scenario based on what I'm currently learning (Curve finance). I'm going to put 1000$ DAI on a cPool (Compound pool). 

1) How is the APY calculated? Is it based only on the reward I get from the swap fee? If they say that the APY is 10% does it mean that from the swap fee I will get on an annual basis a 10% of my initial investment? So they calculate how the volume of trades will be on an annual basis, the fee and calculate 10% is the APY?  
2) Does the APY just take into consideration of the annual fee or it will also include the LP Token reward (in this example CRV) that I get to be an LP? If so how they calculate how much the CRV will be worth on an annual basis? They get the current value, how much CRV I could earn in a year and just multiply it?  
3) Does the gain from Compound (or whatever protocol is used for the pool) is also considered in the APY?  
4) Considering the current gas problem for eth bc, is there a tool that lets me understand when I can deposit/withdraw in a pool without wasting money? Because all those APY will get burned if I cannot leave the pool/sell my CRV (or generic reward token) in time.

5) If I want to avoid eth pools and look into other pools, how does the process work? For example, Curve has the Polygon aave pool that should be less troublesome for the gas price. Will it work the same way as the other pools, so I deposit DAI and withdraw DAI without all the wrapping process?  


I took Curve as an example, does all these questions can be applied to other defi projects like Hyperjump?  


Thank you very much for all time you will spend answering!"
Do you think I'm a neoliberal?,https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/na75vo/do_you_think_im_a_neoliberal/,NathanElFromRealGood,1,2021-05-12 04:41:55,44,/r/neoliberal/comments/na75vo/do_you_think_im_a_neoliberal/,Effortpost,"Hi, first post here. Nice to see a sub that both recognizes the positive aspects of neoliberalism and isn't too defensive about its flaws :) This will be a bit long, hope someone will be interested in reading.

Anyway I have my own economic ideology which I am very passionate about. I feel that many laypeople would at first sight consider it very leftist due to its strong focus on fairness, but overall I feel that qualitatively it more resembles neoliberalism. 

I feel that economies should be above all valued both according to their overall productivity, and to their fairness - and should additionally allow for strong personal freedom. Socialism aims for fairness at the expense of productivity as well as freedom. Meanwhile our modern capitalist economies do the opposite, there is high productivity but limited fairness and freedom is also limited by the quasi-imposition on people of being a ""wage slave"". So I've come up with something that should have the best of both worlds and ensure productivity, fairness and freedom.

So I would have an economy which is mostly free-market capitalist, that's the basic framework. I do support nationalization of sectors that are natural monopolies or that wouldn't be profitable, like road building and postal services, which are already nationalized in most places.

Then it seems logical that if we want fairness, what we really need is to ensure that personal income is distributed as fairly as possible. I don't support absolutely equal pay like some socialist-type economies would have, because you need inequalities to motivate people to work well. But I do advocate for a strongly progressive tax policy. At the bottom, there would be a negative income tax / basic income. The basic income would be about a quarter of the GDP per capita minus government expenditure per capita, i.e. disposable income per capita. At the top, there would be an asymptotic curve to net income versus gross income. I would have income tax rate increase to about 50% to get a net income of 300 000 dollars, so 600 000 gross yields 300 000 net, and then the rates would increase very steeply so that you might have to earn a billion gross to get a million after taxes. The reason for this level is that I feel that quality of life doesn't significantly improve above this, so all wealth above this is wasted and should go to poorer people instead. 

And this would be my only tax, I would have no wealth tax (because it's impractical and nobody would have unfairly high material wealth anyway), no sales tax (because it's unfair to the poor), and no business tax (because it's a burden to the economy). Capital gains would be divided by the number of years the capital was held and the quotient would be applied to the personal income tax for each year and the tax rate would be recalculated for each year and one would have to pay the difference. So the only tax is personal income tax, and there is only a single federal tax, and the revenue then gets distributed to the different levels of government and to the basic income. No local tax. 

I'm also a monetarist who sees that inflation is, as far as I can tell, fundamentally entirely caused by the government creating money out of thin air. I think this is silly and is the reason the economy has become so finance-oriented and also why housing has increased far more than wages and consumer goods have. I would have the government keep the amount of money proportional to the size of the economy. I want all government spending to be paid for through taxes, and specifically personal income tax. Housing has also become too expensive not only because of the above reason, but also because of regulation preventing new housing construction. I would want to relax such regulations, while still ensuring that cities keep a nice amount of public spaces like parks. 

And then I would try to get all this done in as many places as possible, with the goal of having a single global currency and tax policy, and thus necessarily a global federal government. I would want there to be direct democracy at all levels of government. At first I would still restrict mobility of people just to avoid backlash from heavy immigration. I would wait until lower-income countries had become sufficiently rich that there is not much incentive to migrate before eliminating borders completely. By having a cap on income, this allows all growth in global GDP to go to people who actually need it, and allows poorer countries to catch up. Meanwhile a basic income eliminates all severe poverty. 

Okay, so that's my whole policy. What do you think? Is that neoliberalism? Is this a devious plot to implement a Communist Jewish New World Order that will raise White Christian Children as Sex Slaves for the Reptilian Elite? Does anyone else have the same idea? Do you have any criticisms?  I'm actually going to try to get some traction for my policy by posting it in various places and advertising it, so I'm also just trying to ensure I don't say something I'll later disagree with. Any discussion is welcome :)"

Is U.S. fed was inadvertently prompting a South Seas Company type of bubble ????,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/naqbq6/is_us_fed_was_inadvertently_prompting_a_south/,Kimaxw,1,2021-05-12 22:42:01,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/naqbq6/is_us_fed_was_inadvertently_prompting_a_south/,DD,"We started bouncing around the idea that the US Fed was inadvertently prompting a South Seas Company type of bubble event by allowing gross amounts of capital into the markets and artificially keeping interest rates near zero.
For those of you who don‚Äôt know the story of the South Seas Company in London (1720), you can read more about it here: https://www.britannica.com/event/South-Sea-Bubble

FOMO Hyper-inflation Continues (Until It Ends)
In short, The South Seas Company was awarded ¬£7 million to finance the war against France by the House of Lords. This bill, known as the South Sea Bill, allowed the South Sea Company a monopoly on the trade to South America (mostly Slave trade) and was expected to be a boost to the companies bottom line as the war with France ended with the Treaty of Utrecht (1713).
Over the next 5+ years, the South Seas Company enjoyed robust profits and trade. Shares of the South Sea Company rose to 10x their value. Then, the South Seas Company, with King George I of Great Britain as governor of the company in 1781, suggested taking over the national debt of Great Britain in 1720.
The South Seas Company accomplished this incredible feat and shares started to skyrocket higher from $128.5 to over $1000 in just 7 months. As the hype continued to drive speculation and rumors, other stocks (some newly formed companies) were quick to catch the hype and quickly rallied to extreme highs as false statements, word-of-mouth hype and a general hyperbolic frenzy continued to drive speculation.
What brought down the South Seas Company was unbridled rumors, outright lies, hyperbolic speculation, and, eventually, a flood of money from France‚Äôs modernized economy. When the trend finally broke down, it took about 12 months for the entire bubble to deflate‚Äîleaving speculative investors holding empty bags.

The rally of the South Seas Company is very similar to what we are seeing right now in the digital assets. There were a number of facets in place to drive this type of hyperbolic rally.
First, the South Seas Company took over the national debt‚Äîessentially acting like the US Federal Reserve for Great Britain. Secondly, the wild speculation related to ongoing business activities and future expectations prompted an over-enthusiastic buying frenzy‚Äîdriving prices higher by 10x traditional valuation levels.
In the end, with all the speculation, hype and people of title involved, the expected profits and returns from the South Seas Company never really materialized. The stock price started to decline and finally broke downward very sharply near late 1720

Open Letter to the Bonfire DEVS,https://www.reddit.com/r/BonfireToken/comments/nb41vc/open_letter_to_the_bonfire_devs/,QubixRubix,1,2021-05-13 08:38:27,36,/r/BonfireToken/comments/nb41vc/open_letter_to_the_bonfire_devs/,Community,"Bonfire,

Tonight was a train crash in some ways and beneficial in others, however it's done, don't beat yourselves up, it will be forgotten next week, move on, have a learning from experiance session (LFE).  I believe in ""Judging those on what they do, not what they say, as alot of full of it mand over promise"", Bonfire is on a roadmap hitting the targets.  Some of the criticism tonight became overly personal, ugly and childish.  I expect Bonfire got trolled by fans of other crypto's looking to boost their market caps and whales manipulating the price,  which tbh I made coin off.   However, if it was a small part of the community that hasn't got the avocado's for investing and were just looking for a reason to leave just leave, it's not for you, keep meme's to yourselves.

However, moving on a learning curve for everyone.

Bonfire need to polish the presentation and brand, don't rush to do another AMA, for the sake of putting out some panto tomorrow, get it right, know what you want to say and communicate a positive focused message.  An AMA should be to make big announcements and answer questions on that announcement and maybe an upcoming big ticket deliverable.   Be targeted and focused.   Bonfire tbh is over transparent compared to other crypto's and any company for that matter, we don't need influencers we need business leaders.  After tonight I delved into some of links and profiles and ended up on f\*\*\*\*g Tik Tok with a man with a towel on his head, prancing round his bedroom.  CLEAN IT UP, that's your public image, do it now!  I need a paragraph about each of you, if people need more they can contact you.  Get some life experience on the team ASAP.  Your men and women running a company with the potential to hit 2-4bn market cap, you could be seriously rich if you do it right.

Also Bonfire management don't need to show themselves in person all the time to prove Bonfire is not a rug pull.  In fact this level of over-exposure is damaging.  Just deliver on the milestones and be realistic in setting them.  Then do an AMA if the milestone warrants it and it's big news.   Find two people from somewhere that are good at presenting, have PR training and are charismatic and credible to deliver the AMA and field questions.  Bonfire doesn't need everyone at the AMA and don't talk over each other.  When you talk imagine people are scrutinizing every gesture you make, tone in your voice, the look on your face.  You snigger at the wrong time or get too excited and it could be over.  They may have there life savings tied up in your company and they are looking at you to see if your going to lose it all.  Be calm, be balanced and accurate, anything that borders on an exercise in vanity, pointless.  Whether you like him or not think how Jorden Peterson navigates complex highly controversial topics.

Let people ask questions and don't be afraid, have a few generic responses like, ""we will know more on that soon"" or ""we are in development and will release detail shortly"".  You're not being dishonest or non-transparent.  As a side It's good to hold some developments as a surprise.  Imagine tonight if you had waited and put this AMA back to say May 30th, one a month!, and at that AMA you had a working demonstration of your platform or an app.

  
Think about what do people ""need to know"" and ""what do they care about"", cut the fluff, competitions, all that, we are all here to make money, your in the most cutthroat business Finance,  treat it as such, treat Bonfire as what it is a business.  Investors care about the technology, the road map and the share price going up, important announcements and milestones.  Social media only goes so far in the end.  Build yourself a company you can pay yourselves 100k+ a year.

Arrogant and opinionated I am, but that's the industry your in, sort it out.

That advice you get for free.  Good luck.  I bought the dip, make me richer.

I'm pissed off and honestly it feels so unethical.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/nb5k3a/i_want_to_report_a_professor_and_student_grading/,tiggermita,1,2021-05-13 09:52:58,3,/r/college/comments/nb5k3a/i_want_to_report_a_professor_and_student_grading/,USA,"So to give more context to this story. I attend an institution in south Florida and just completed finance. In this class, my classmate and I worked very hard on the material and practically taught ourselves the material because the professor was a hot mess. Not only did she always come to class unprepared but had no idea what she was teaching. In this class one of my other professors husband is also taking this class to which she reached out to me because he wasn't doing well in the class. My classmate and I invite him to our zoom sessions to help him and he tells us that he's failed 3-4 sections and has close to an F in the class. We start to help him as my classmate and I have passed all sections so far with an A and thankfully the hard work is paying off so far.

I just found out from the professor (his wife) that he passed the class. My classmate and I received a 94% in the class which we were happy about. This is the part that pisses me off. The finance professor told us we would be getting a curve on our grade because she messed something up or whatever. I found out that the husband received a 16 freaking point curve and ended up with a 99% final grade. I want to complain, this isn't fair how someone who failed sections was able to get a higher grade than us. Attendance wasn't mandatory and there was no deduction in grade if we didn't attend. We stop attending because the professor ended up confusing us on the subject and rather spoke to us about her law career than teach us. 

Is this ethical? It seems very fucked that he'd get a 99% final grade when we received 94% and that's with us acing everything across the board. 

What can I do here? What do you recommend? It's bothering me so much that we put so much effort for this dude to basically work the system probably because his wife is a high end professor there and brown nosed his way. 

So unfair, please advise what the best course of action is. 

p.s. i just also found out his wife was let go and will no longer be a director or full time professor after summer semester. Which means he also looses the cheaper classes benefits."

Crypto experts and day-traders may want to stay away- as the platform wasn‚Äôt designed for you. However, if that expectation is set, I think this platform may be the best way to place a long-term bet on the entire crypto space- but it‚Äôs definitely ce-de-fi or centralized-decentralized-finance.

The platform of which I speak is Voyager (see r/investvoyager or investvoyager.com). Now, I realize there‚Äôs been mixed feedback of this platform... including a bunch of shill‚Äôing and FUDing, but those exaggerated responses seem largely due to folks mis-understanding the best use case of Voyager. Voyager is a platform for the average citizen... (middle income, tech aware- but not necessarily savvy, crypto-curious- but not an expert,wants to ‚Äòget rich fast‚Äô - but knows building wealth is a process).

If you fall into that massive bell of the curve, I‚Äôd highly recommend checking out Voyager. I‚Äôve tried Binance, Coinbase, BlockFi, kraken and eToro... and investigated some of the others (Gemini, Celsius, weBull) and none offers the opportunity that Voyager does. On Voyager you can safely dip your toes into the crypto space with interest-bearing tokens yielding up to 9% interest. Better yet, that interest can be earned on the safest of crypto, the stablecoin USDC. Better still, there‚Äôs 50+ tokens (with more coming) that you can diversify into and explore with ‚Äúno fee‚Äù trading. Voyager does earn money of the bid/ask spread on non-stablecoin purchases, but they are not shy about explaining the benefits of their free-trading, broker model. Their interest program, secure platform and diverse crypto offerings allow user to engage in tried an true investing (note: not trading) strategies such as automatic downward cost averaging through interest or buying and Hodling ‚Äòblue-chip‚Äô cryptos like BTC and ETH while earning interest.

Best of all, this is already a phenomenal product, but the leadership team‚Äôs vision and experience have the potential to truly revolutionize personal finance for the masses. Call me a shill if you like, but I think this platform will be big and it‚Äôs not necessarily a question of ‚Äòif‚Äô, but ‚Äòwhen‚Äô. Compared to other platforms they‚Äôve been less marketed and are still ‚Äòunder-the-radar‚Äô.

If you have questions about the platform, dm me. Happy to share my experiences."

The posts we see here on this forum from the likes of Ditch\_the\_deepstate, talking finance and Happy Hawaiian and so massively superior to the verbal vomit that gets posted in traditional news channels like reuters. I just read some idiot on Reuters saying that ""gold is weak because inflation might cause yields to rise"". Completely ignores the fact that nominal yields mean nothing and it's all about real yields that are now deeply negative. If they do move to high, which in the current market will ONLY happen because of inflation, the fed will step in (eventually with full blown yield curve control). This will only make riel yields even more negative....silver and gold to the moon.

The moral of the story is that I think there are a lot apes here who are an awful lot more knowledgable now about economics and precious metals market than they may even give themselves credit for. The average guy in the street doesn't understand real and nominal yields. Many columnists on Reuters and Bloomberg clearly don't either. They just talk bullshit to fill in time. But when the cost of a loaf of bread is $10 and they haven't stacked any shiny only then will they understand what we already too."
Yearn Finance and The YFI Token Explained!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nbzem2/yearn_finance_and_the_yfi_token_explained/,J_S_artboy,1,2021-05-14 11:35:57,7,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nbzem2/yearn_finance_and_the_yfi_token_explained/,EDUCATIONAL," The Yearn protocol is the most essential part of Yearn Finance. Yearn is a yield optimizer that focuses on maximizing Decentralized Finance capabilities by switching between different lending protocols automatically. Andre Cronje, the creator of the Yearn protocol, began looking into automating his strategy for selecting the highest-paid lending protocol for his stablecoins in early 2020.

Andre had to manually verify the protocol pays the highest APY on every given day before considering transferring his funds to that protocol before the first iteration of the protocol. Compound, AAVE, Fulcrum, and dYdX were only a few of the alternatives available at the moment. Andre began coding the first version of the Yearn protocol to simplify the whole process of selecting the most optimal technique for his stablecoins after this manual work became routine and boring.

In particular, the protocol creates a pool for each stablecoin. When a consumer deposits a stablecoin into a pool, they are given yTokens, which are yield-bearing equivalents of the coin deposited. When a user deposits DAI, for example, the protocol returns yDAI. The resulting DAI can then be switched between various lending protocols to increase the yield at all times. For example, if AAVE yields more DAI than Compound, the Yearn protocol may choose to pass all or part of the DAI to AAVE. When a user deposits or withdraws money from the pool, the protocol scans to see if a better yield is open, and if so, the pool is rebalanced. Users will redeem their yDAI and collect the underlying DAI if they wish to remove their original DAI plus interest.

The protocol still ensures that the originally deposited stablecoin is never swapped for a new stablecoin, even though a higher yield is available. For example, if a user deposits DAI, the protocol will never convert it to USDC, even if USDC has a higher yield. This is the scenario, since most people prefer to withdraw the same stablecoins they invested

Andre wanted to open up the protocol to more people who were involved in automating their yield strategies after the original version was finished. Adding more funds to the pool was helpful to the protocol because it provided additional chances for causing rebalances as more deposits and withdrawals occurred. Andre got to work on making the protocol better. As the pool's funds grew, certain previously obvious strategies, such as transferring coins to the highest-paying lending protocol, ceased to function. Now, the protocol had to consider what would happen to the APY if a huge sum of money is pushed in, so it had to optimize dividing funds between various protocols to choose the best one.

Andre began working on the yCRV liquidity pool with Curve at this time. The yCRV pool includes the yTokens yDAI, yUSDC, yUSDT, and yTUSD, making it simple to switch between them without having to unwrap them into their underlying tokens. Users will earn trading commissions for offering liquidity as well as a return on their yield-bearing yTokens by depositing stablecoins to the yCRV pool.

Finding the best APY on a given stablecoin was relatively simple up until this stage. With the introduction of liquidity mining, this changed significantly, as shown by Compound's COMP token distribution. The COMP token distribution clashed with the beginning of the Yield Farming craze. COMP farming fundamentally altered the landscape of determining the best yield, and testing a deposit's APY was no longer necessary. You'd have to add up all the additional tokens that were being sold to get the real yield. Finding the right solutions becomes more difficult.

With the Yield Farming craze in full effect, Andre and the Yearn community embarked on a new project: Vaults. Yearn Vaults are, at their core, funds pools with a mechanism for optimizing returns on the vaulted asset. Vault strategies go beyond just lending out coins. In fact, most strategies can do several things to optimize returns, such as farming other tokens for profit, offering liquidity, or borrowing stablecoins. Each vault follows a strategy that the Yearn community has chosen.

Andre agreed to allocate a governance token to the Yearn community to further decentralize the protocol and enable other people to make meaningful decisions about its future. Yearn's token allocation was designed to ensure a fair launch and to reward the Yearn community. The YFI token had no pre-mine, no VC distribution, and no team incentive to guarantee a decent launch. Many of the tokens are allocated to the protocol's users. The yCRV pool's liquidity providers received 10,000 YFI tokens as part of a nine-day token delivery. To collect YFI rewards, the LPs had to stake their yCRV LP tokens. Two more Balancer pools were introduced shortly after, each with 10,000 tokens, for a total of 30,000 YFI tokens.

Despite a disclaimer that the YFI token has no financial value, funds began to flow into the incentivized pools, with the total locked value exceeding $600 million. In addition, the YFI token began quickly appreciating. Before the governance went live, the creator of the protocol had control of the governance admin key, which added to the risk. This key could theoretically be used to generate more YFI tokens, causing the price of YFI to crash. This was easily fixed by converting the single admin key to a multi-signature key that required multiple Yearn community signers.

The Yearn governance uses the YFI token in its current form to vote on the protocol's future with one of the most committed and dedicated communities in Decentralized Finance. There is also a lot of optimism about future revenue from the YFI tokens, which is driving up the price. The YFI token has increased in value from about $6 since it first began trading to over $88,000 today.

Yearn is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating protocols in Decentralized Finance, but as with just about anything else in DeFi, make sure you consider the risks before choosing to use it."

&gt;A closely tracked ratio in cryptocurrency markets known as the ‚ÄúGrayscale premium‚Äù flipped earlier this year to a discount, and it has widened this week to a gaping 21%, which is the highest level on record, according to Skew, a crypto analysis firm.

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), from the crypto asset manager Grayscale, is the largest U.S. investment vehicle for buying bitcoin (BTC) through a stock exchange. The Grayscale discount represents the difference between the price of the underlying bitcoin assets and the value that‚Äôs implied from the price of the trust‚Äôs shares.  
The bet some traders could be making now is that the discount would evaporate if Grayscale receives approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert the trust to an exchage-traded fund. If that happened, according to one analyst, the shares might quickly climb back toward the price of the underlying bitcoin ‚Äî allowing traders to recapture the discount as a profit while still booking any gains from the cryptocurrency itself.  
‚ÄúInvestors looking for long-term passive bitcoin exposure are probably better off buying GBTC over spot bitcoin since you get paid to wait more via the discount than you pay in excess fees,‚Äù David Grider, strategist at investment research firm FundStrat, wrote in an email.  
In recent years, when GBTC was trading at a premium, the situation looked much different.

# 3. Crypto Options Market Makers Starting to Influence Bitcoin Price

&gt;***‚ÄúMarket makers were heavily short puts in the range of $52,000 to $50,000, and I estimate were forced to sell nearly 2,900 bitcoin,‚Äù one trader said.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Bitcoin (BTC) tanked on Wednesday, hitting multi-month lows near $46,000 as renewed fears of an early rate hike by the Federal Reserve, the recent dour mood in financial markets and Tesla‚Äôs decision to suspend bitcoin payments were all blamed for the slide.  
But the downward move was likely aggravated by options market makers selling the cryptocurrency in the spot/futures market to hedge their books (offset bullish exposure), according to Fredrick Collins, a seasoned options trader and researcher at Glassnode.  
‚ÄúMarket makers were heavily short puts in the range of $52,000 to $50,000, and I estimate were forced to sell nearly 2,900 bitcoin during the crash to offset the short gamma exposure,‚Äù Collins told us. ‚ÄúThat likely exacerbated the bearish move.‚Äù

# 4. Bitcoin Wallet Used by DarkSide for Ransom Payments ID‚Äôd by Elliptic

&gt;***Since becoming active, the wallet has received bitcoin transactions totaling $17.5 million, the data analysis firm said.***  
&gt;  
&gt;The wallet used by the DarkSide ransomware group to receive bitcoin (BTC, +1.43%) ransom payments has been identified, according to data analysis firm Elliptic, citing intelligence collection and analysis of blockchain transactions.  
The wallet received the 75 BTC payment reportedly made by Colonial Pipeline on May 8, following the cyberattack that led to widespread fuel shortages in the U.S., Elliptic said in its report.  
The wallet has been active since early March and has received 57 payments from 21 different wallets, including some matching ransoms known to have been paid to the group in other cases of blackmail, the firm said.  
Since becoming active, the wallet has received bitcoin transactions totaling $17.5 million, Elliptic said.  
Elliptic also said it has been able to gain intel on how DarkSide laundered prior attacks, potentially allowing authorities to locate the people behind them.  
Earlier Friday, KrebsOnSecurity and others reported that the DarkSide group has decided to shut itself down after its own servers were seized and someone drained crypto from an account belonging to the group.

# 5. Cryptocurrency Custodian Anchorage Adds Five More DeFi Tokens

&gt;***In a further sign of ‚Äúinstitutional DeFi‚Äù momentum, the regulated custodian is adding 1INCH, BNT, CRV, REN and SUSHI.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Anchorage is adding five more decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens to its custody vaults, with a focus on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs), the beating heart of DeFi.  
Announced Friday, Anchorage, the first crypto custodian to win a U.S. federal banking charter, is adding support for DeFi tokens 1INCH, BNT (+6.47%), Curve Finance (CRV), REN (+5.07%) and SushiSwap (SUSHI).  
DeFi investment has grown at an explosive rate with the equivalent of more than $85 billion USD currently locked across Ethereum‚Äôs DeFi ecosystem at the time of writing. Anchorage pointed out in a blog post that the DeFi universe had grown by more than nine times in value since Anchorage added support for Uniswap, Yearn and others late last year.

Due Diligence - Coal Bed Methane Natural Gas Resource (Part 3 0f 3),https://www.reddit.com/r/3CPG_PetroleumGeology/comments/ndya6n/due_diligence_coal_bed_methane_natural_gas/,Ok-GeodesRock49,1,2021-05-17 05:20:32,2,/r/3CPG_PetroleumGeology/comments/ndya6n/due_diligence_coal_bed_methane_natural_gas/,NaN,"# Coal Bed Methane - Part 3 of (4) The development of the prolific San Juan Basin Coal Bed Methane Gas production. 

(continued from part 2) ...

The highly successful recompletions of the  ***Fulcher-Kutz Pictured Cliffs wells*** and the observance of methane gas from the overlying Fruitland Coal marked the beginning of the San Juan Basin development. The Denver office for AMOCO Production Company began a focused effort to evaluate the potential. A complete staff of geologists, production engineers, reservoir engineers, petroleum engineers, drilling and completion engineers, landmen, finance, and management formed a team to develop the coal gas. 

Based on the combined team work, AMOCO chose a location not in the Fulcher-Kutz area, but north, close to the Colorado State line on Cedar Hill just off highway 550 to Durango Colorado. 

&gt;Case history:   
&gt;  
&gt;The first well specifically for coal-bed methane in New Mexico was drilled in 1977 by Amoco Production Co. in the Cedar Hill field northeast of Aztec. The well was the Cahn #1 - an open hole test.   
&gt;  
&gt;Cedar Hill CBM field. Amoco Production Company completed the initial Fruitland coalbed gas well in this field in May 1977, producing from the thick (up to \~25ft, 7.6m) basal coal of this formation. Public records show that, as of 31 October 1993, the field had produced nearly 54BCF (1.5BCM) of gas from 23 producing Fruitland wells. During the month of October 1993, average daily production per well was approximately 714 MCF (20 MCM). The most productive wells in this field are characterized by high fracture permeability.   
&gt;  
&gt; In 1977, Amoco Production Company discovered the Cedar Hill field that produced CBM from Fruitland coal beds. Amoco was the first company in the Western US daring enough to produce large amounts of water from coal beds to stimulate CBM production. (( A direct result of the ***Fulcher-Kutz Pictured Cliffs well recompletions )).***  
&gt;  
&gt;The Amoco Cahn #1 well was reported to begin initial production of a few MCF of gas per day and many barrels of water. Over time, as the well de-watered, the gas increased to over 55 Million Cubic Feet of Gas Per Day. It was noted in part 2 of this 3 part series that coal bed methane increases and then decreases as a bell curve - graphs were illustrated.   
&gt;  
&gt; In 1988, the first year production records for the Basin Fruitland pool were kept, coal-bed methane production from the San Juan Basin of New Mexico was 14 billion cubic feet (BCF, : 0.014 TCF) from a year-end total of 77 wells. Annual production in 1989 increased to 55 BCF from 323 wells and in 1990 was 131 BCF from 734 wells. In December 1990, Fruitland coal-bed methane production made up about 31% of the monthly gas production from the San Juan Basin and 17% of the monthly gas production from all of the state of New Mexico.  

The below graph clearly indicates the cumulative production of the Fruitland CBM (Coal Bed Methane) in relationship to all the other producing reservoirs in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico. Note the basin-wide Bell Curve.

Cumulative gas production was addressed in a published article  titled ""The San Juan Basin, a Complex Giant Gas Field, New Mexico and Colorado\* by James E. Fassett in Search and Discovery Article #10254 (2010, 2013) Posted October 18, 2013: Portions of the Abstract follow.

&gt;The San Juan Basin of northwest New Mexico and southwest Colorado is the second largest gas basin in the United States, second to the greater Hugoton Field of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas.   
&gt;  
&gt;Until the 1970s, most of the gas produced in the basin came from the three major fractured-sandstone reservoirs: the Dakota Sandstone, the Mesaverde Group, and the Pictured Cliffs Sandstone, all of Late Cretaceous age.   
&gt;  
&gt;Starting in the late 1970s \[*AMOCO*\], and accelerating in the 1980s to the present, production from coal-bed methane (CBM) reservoirs in the basin has gone from virtually none to around one trillion cubic ft of gas (TCFG)/year, making the San Juan Basin‚Äôs Fruitland CBM field the largest CBM field in the world.   
&gt;  
&gt;Through September 2009, the basin‚Äôs fractured-sandstone reservoirs produced 24.4 trillion cubic ft of gas (TCFG) from 24,000 wells: 7.0 TCFG from the Dakota Sandstone, 12.9 TCFG from the Mesaverde Group, and 4.5 TCFG from the Pictured Cliffs Sandstone. These three reservoirs have also produced 98.2 million barrels of natural-gas liquids (condensate).   
&gt;  
&gt;Fruitland Formation CBM production is 15.7 TCFG from 7,700 wells. Cumulative gas production from these natural-gas reservoirs is 40.1 TCFG. Cumulative gas production from all of the nearly 40,000 wells in the basin totals 42.7 TCFG with the additional 2.6 TCFG coming from the basin‚Äôs many scattered oil fields and smaller gas fields. note: CBM gas production represents 36.77% of total San Juan Basin production.

# Historical Coal Bed Methane Production - totally ignored and by-passed. 

Coalbed methane in the USA: analogues for worldwide development by D. KEITH MURRAY D. Keith Murray &amp; Associates, Inc., 200 Union Boulevard, Suite 215, Lakewood, CO 80228-1830, USA  (date unknown)

\*\*\*Case history of a long-lived coalbed methane well.\*\*\*

Because of the relative infancy of the CBM industry, where well-documented production histories seldom exceed 10 years, a detailed case study by Hale &amp; Firth (1988) provides some important clues regarding the potential productive life of such wells. 

The San Juan 32-7 Unit No. 6 well, San Juan County, New Mexico, is located in the Los Pinios Fruitland, South, pool, in T3N, R7W, NMPM, in the northern San Juan Basin. This well, originally designated the 6-17 San Juan 32-7 Unit, was completed by Phillips Petroleum Co. in August 1953. According to Hale &amp; Firth (1988), this Fruitland Formation (Upper Cretaceous) well has produced more than 1.364 BCF (0.04 MMCM) of gas over a period of 34 years (i.e. through 1987) with *no decline in rates or reservoir pressure.* 

The original Phillips well was drilled to 3054 ft (931 m), at which point 7 inches (17.8 cm) casing was set. The drilling mud was removed and the well was drilled with gas to a total depth of 3240ft (988m) to provide a safe means of detecting any water and to protect against a large gas flow. At 3232 ft (985 m) a large flow of gas was noted, measuring as much as 2420 MCF/d (68.5MCM/d) at 3236ft (986m). Drilling continued to 3240 ft total depth, leaving a 187 ft (57m) open-hole section, which was not logged. The well registered an initial potential of 1790 MCF/d (51 MCM/d). The producing reservoir is moderately over-pressured, with a pressure gradient of 0.47 PSI/ft. Although this well was not logged, correlation with nearby logged wells leaves little doubt that the producing reservoir is a lower Fruitland coal bed approximately 40 ft (12.2m) thick. 

Analyses of the produced gas demonstrate that it is typical pipeline quality coalbed gas: 94.24% methane, 4.97% carbon dioxide, 0.36% ethane and traces of nitrogen and heavier hydrocarbon gases, with an average BTU content of 969 BTU/SCF. Figure 7 \[*below*\] (after Hale &amp; Firth 1988) shows that the production rate of the 32-7 Unit No. 6 well has remained remarkably constant for about 30 years, between 150 and 180 MCF/d (4.2 and 5.1 MCM/ d), except for a few anomalous months. In the autumn of 1978, a 32-day pressure build-up test was conducted. 

 \----- **The extrapolated reservoir pressure of 1502 PSIG was extremely close to the pressure measured 25 years earlier, in 1953, of 1504 PSIG, indicating no measurable pressure depletion. ---**

 The San Juan 32-7 Unit No. 6 well is one of the oldest continuously producing coalbed gas wells in the USA, if not the world. It was completed long before the significance of this unique reservoir had been realized. It lies just south of the synclinal axis of the San Juan Basin and appears not to exhibit any structural enhancement. The well has never been stimulated, nor has it required any appreciable maintenance. No significant water production has ever been reported. The production rate has remained essentially constant since 1953. Of the most significance is the fact that this well demonstrates that coalbed gas, under conditions of favorable geology and reservoir characteristics, can be produced economically for a period of at least 30-40 years.

What is DeFi? (An Intro Guide since people are asking),https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/ne33yp/what_is_defi_an_intro_guide_since_people_are/,economicsdesign,1,2021-05-17 09:19:23,1,/r/ethtrader/comments/ne33yp/what_is_defi_an_intro_guide_since_people_are/,Discussion,"**DeFi 101 FAQ**

* Why is decentralising important? Because users like you and me can now take control of the money we use, instead of relying on banks and intermediaries. They are taking a lot of mark up in this process!
* What ""power"" does DeFi bring? It gives people the ability to create and move money across the world at any given time
* What's the difference between DeFi and bitcoin? Bitcoin is money. It's programmable money. DeFi is the operating system of money. So bitcoin is like Facebook app. And DeFi is the iOS that your iPhone runs on.

**What is DeFi**

DeFi means decentralised finance. 10 years ago, we saw the creation of Bitcoin ‚Äî a decentralised money. Building upon this asset (decentralised money), we are now at the stage of decentralised finance.

**Give Me An Example**

If Adam has $100 and Ron needs to borrow $100, how does that work? If you trust each other, you can just lend directly, and maybe Adam charges an interest rate, let's say 5%.

In the traditional finance space today, you don't know each other. So Adam put the money with the bank. The bank pays Adam some interest. Then the bank uses that money to find people like Ron, who wants to borrow. And Ron pays the interest to the bank.

DeFi now replaces the role of the bank. And solves the problem of ""trust"" across the world. Instead of trusting the people, DeFi turns that trust into code in the system. How? (1) money (aka Facebook app) is programmable. And (2) the operating system of money (aka your iOS or Android system) is also programmable.

Now, Adam can find all the Rons in the world without having to

* Trust Ron or know Ron personally
* Engage with a bank or third party that will take profits away
* Find a centralised institution

**Tell Me More about this ""Programmable Money System"" thing**

We are basically programming code into the money (e.g. $Dai). And in the code, we incentivise people to put money in or take money out.

How? We do this by changing interest rates.

This will change people's behaviours by creating loans and to encourage lending or borrowing.

When demand drops, the interest rate drops. People are more likely to demand more $Dai now, since it is cheaper.

When demand goes up, there is too much supply. Interest rates increase. People demand less $Dai because it's more expensive now.

The change in interest rate is executed by programs and code!

**What's so cool about it though?**

Well, you can use this programmable money ($Dai) to lend it out. Someone can borrow it and use it as collateral to do something else instead. Maybe like to stake the $Dai in a Curve vault and gain both interest and $CRV governance token while also earning $YFI tokens.

The entire system is a huge lego building block to stake on top of each other. That's where the fun begins!"
Some random thoughts about some random alts.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ne6z3u/some_random_thoughts_about_some_random_alts/,ethereumflow,1,2021-05-17 12:47:05,50,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ne6z3u/some_random_thoughts_about_some_random_alts/,LEGACY,"I'm an interoperability maximalist that believes in a multi-chain local network future, I don't think it will be a one chain rule them all world. I have always taken a research based approach and have dug into the depths of crypto to find projects I think are cool. This is sort of a brain dump of some different projects that I like and some explanation as to why. 

None of this is meant as shilling, I am simply sharing what I think is cool. Some of these I hold, some I don't. Don't buy my bags, always do your own research. 

**ATOM**: What people don't realize about it is what's to come. Once everything is going with the GravityDEX, Osmosis, liquid staking and Ethermint then ATOM will be a strong competitor. As the centre of the Interchain Finance vision Cosmos Hub will be a key player in the internet of blockchains connecting all of these networks together. I shill this one here plenty so I won't get too into it. 

**SCRT**: This isn't the only privacy mention I will have. I believe in privacy to be a fundamental human right and financial privacy is misunderstood. Secret Network offer a unique solution of programmable privacy. Rather than being a privacy coin SCRT is a platform for privacy applications. Everything on the SCRT main chain is transparent, addresses are public and validators as well. SCRT is not much different than ATOM in the simplest of terms but the applications of Secret Network are what sets it apart. All data in Secret contracts is encrypted. Encrypted inputs, outputs and state. This is how SecretSwap is able to be the first anti-front running DEX in crypto. Transactions are fully private, the explorer only shows that your address interacted with a smart contract. No values, no send or receive details whatsoever. As part of the Cosmos ecosystem SCRT will support IBC eventually but I feel like I should mention that SNIP20 tokens will not be. IBC won't be able to read secret contracts. 

**BEAM**: If I am honest I don't think Monero is scalable enough to be a long term privacy solution, the road to correct that is a long one. SCRT, while I think is fantastic, does not have the same ""money"" characteristics as MimbleWimble chains do, they serve different purposes. While I like the philosophy of GRIN more BEAM is years ahead in terms of development and far more user friendly. If GRIN suddenly had a multi-million dollar dev fund and committed teams able to contribute then it would be a different story. Until then BEAM is one of the most interesting and innovative platforms I have used. MimbleWimble is such a fascinating protocol, one might say magical, and BEAM have done a great job maximizing the tech. It's a centralized approach like ZEC but BEAM is on the road to decentralization and the BEAM company will progress to the BEAM foundation with more open governance. Using BEAM goes to show the value of having funded devs on the project though. 

MimbleWimble is pretty complicated because there are no addresses, no wallets so to speak and with BEAM they have added Dandelion(this ""fluffs"" the transaction to multiple nodes), zero-knowledge proofs and LelantusMW. Another thing with MimbleWimble is that transactions require interactions from both sender and reciever(annoying right?). This means that the receiver needs to be online when the sender sends, to make this easier BEAM have added a Secure Bulletin Board System(SBBS) which allows for the transaction to be signed by the other wallet within 12 hours. Again, this only requires the wallet being online and no other functions so if the wallet is a full node then it will be received immediately. BEAM transactions are fast and private and fun to do. You can even perform offline transactions to make it even more badass. 

**DGB**: DigiByte was an early interest of mine. It's as decentralized as any network could be and has no leading figure or team. There is the DigiByte Foundation which is a non-profit group of volunteers that are passionate about the future of DigiByte. The longest, fastest, most decentralized and most secure UTXO proof of work blockchain, DGB is underrated and undervalued in my opinion. DigiByte supports Digi-assets(essnetially NFTs) and has a working Digi-ID blockchain based login system. Antum ID have adopted it for a small scale project.

 DigiByte is not a privacy coin, though Coingecko class it as one, but they have one cool privacy feature added, Dandelion++. You may remember this one from BEAM, same idea but DigiByte adopted the same concept as GRIN and Monero. Dandelion protocol is kind of direct metaphor to what happens. There is a stem phase of the transaction when it is sent, then it goes into the fluff phase when the transaction is broken up into bits and sent to various nodes(this is slightly slower as a result). Unlike Monero ring signatures this isn't meant to hide the transaction but is rather to obfuscate the sender's IP address. 

The DigiByte community is also great. I have been a member of it for a while and keep up to date with it. I've even contributed to their guides for Ren Bridge as a tester and writer. The cool thing about it is that's how DigiByte happened, people volunteering their time to contribute to the network. I've learned a lot from Josiah as far as community focus growth and decentralization as a core value. 

**REN**: Since I just mentioned renDGB this is a good transition. I don't hold any REN, I like RenVM but didn't plan to run a dark node, which is the only use case for the token. I was an early adopter and tester of Ren Bridge and credit Ren for being the reason I became an interoperability maximalist. Using Ren Bridge taught me the value in cross chain value exchange and liquidity transfers. Largely a learning experience I used Ren Bridge to research the best privacy approach to Ethereum DeFi, renZEC used to be the best privacy solution (until renZEC which is public) for exchanging into and out of Ethereum and then Secret Network came along. I still think renZEC has a cool use case for Ethereum but it would now be better off bridged to Secret Network to stay private. 

Fun fact about Ren, the team behind it helped build wBTC. The knowledge they gained working on wBTC is why we now have renBTC, a decentralized and permissionless version of wBTC. wBTC Cafe uses Ren Bridge and Curve finance through a smart contract to permissionlessly wrap BTC onto Ethereum for wBTC. Ren Bridge transactions were the first really cool smart contracts I got to see and understand and that's what got me so into it. Such a complicated operation was made so simple. The team behind the project are brilliant and also very open to conversation and helpful to users of the platform. Similar to what I mentioned about BEAM, REN have a progressive decentralization plan. They wanted to build  working product and be able to help users along the way in a sort of live testnet. Everything is still considered a sort of live beta right now, not just RenVM, and it will become more decentralized as it grows. There are already over 1300 REN dark nodes. 

**NEAR**: Sharded proof of stake blockchain with Ethereum token and smart contract support, a joke in the community is ""ETH 2.0 is NEAR"". NEAR protocol is a really interesting project, they are also on a progressive decentralization plan and are now in the decentralized phase of it. They launched first as a proof of authority mainnet and have transitioned to their proof of stake mainnet now. The focus for NEAR is on usability for both developers and users of the platform. NEAR wallet has usernames instead of confusing addresses(after a 1-time setup) so that it's easier to send/receive tokens. The platform is fast and simple to use, NEAR is a sleeping giant in my very biased opinion. A lot of their use case seems to be growing in the NFT space as they have Mintbase launching very soon and Paras is live. DeFi will be an obvious addition and Ref Finance is the current community built option for the brave willing to test out a sharded DEX on NEAR. 

What I like most about NEAR is the usability. The story goes that they showed up at an Ethereum hack-a-thon and spent most of the time setting up their tooling. Multiple members of the NEAR team are competition winning developers that worked at places like Google and MemSQL so they figured that the issue was in dev tooling rather than dev skills. They set out to create the dev tools needed and did so with their own more scalable and more usable blockchain. The NEAR devs also led whiteboard sessions on YouTube which featured other devs from various projects like Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot and Solana, sharing ideas, thoughts and code. NEAR has taken a collection of ideas from these whiteboard sessions and hacked them together into what is one of the most high performance blockchains out there. 

*NEAR is also certified carbon neutral. This is important to me.*

**ZIL**: The other sharded chain, actually the first one, Zilliqa has taken their own approach to the scaling problem. Zilliqa, like Ethereum, has a custom programming language, Scilla. It is based on oCaml so may be familiar to some but is not popular. They say it is a secure programming language and I believe the, because the devs behind Zilliqa are smart. Dr. Xinshu Dong was a privacy and security programmer securing web browsers prior to and Amrit Kumar was an XMR contributor before knowing what Bitcoin was. Their combined knowledge with many other academics from the University of Singapore tell me that the brain power behind Zilliqa is strong. 

ZIL is fast, low fee and eco-friendly thanks to Zilliqa's hybrid proof of work-Byzantine fault tolerant model. Only require minutes of mining per day ZIL is able to achieve consensus through a staking mechanism. I think Byzantine fault tolerance is fascinating as it's important for Cosmos chains and illiqa are using a different approach from Cosmos there and also have a different sharding technique than NEAR. 

An interesting connection for Zilliqa comes through ZilSwap, which is powered by Switcheo. Switcheo is built with the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint which means ZilSwap will be able to support Cosmos IBC eventually, when they decide it's worth adding. ZilSwap will also be bridged to Ethereum and Binance meaning they are building a role as an cross chain DEX. 

**ANT**: Aragon is a DAO of DAOs and when it comes to decentralization Aragon is as raw to the core as it gets. Aragon is totally open source and management of the project is up to the community. AragonDAO powers plenty of projects like AAVE, 1hive, Decentraland and many more. AragonDAO is even the treasury custodian for Agave, a 1hive project built on xDAI. Agave almost deserves its own mention and you should DYOR on that one because it‚Äôs pretty sweet, pun intended. 

I‚Äôm big on governance and have learned a lot about concepts and ideas from Aragon. Luis Cuende is an inspiration and the ethos behind the project can motivate anyone to make a change. Aragon is a manifesto driven organization. The community involved are all motivated by the same vision for a better, more decentralized world. 

**ONT**: Ontology is often viewed as a NEO airdrop that went nowhere, that couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. Ontology went through a mainnet upgrade in 2020 which changed their staking system and network entirely. It‚Äôs a new and improved platform with some cool innovations. Ont-ID is a key feature of theirs along with their decentralized credit score system. Li Jun, co-founder, often talks about Ontology in relation to data. DEX is a DDX to him, a decentralized data exchange. He also refers to Ontology as a decentralized trust network. There are different levels of decentralization and Ontology are targeting more enterprise adoption and have tailored their network accordingly. 

Wing Finance is built on Ontology and is the only DeFi option on the network. Wing utilizes the credit score system built by Ontology for a credit score based lending platform, a pretty exciting innovation in the space. 

ONTO wallet might be the best thing about Ontology. Full support for ETH/ERC20 tokens and access to dapps like Uniswap, SushiSwap, AAVE, MakerDAO, Curve, KyberSwap, CREAM and more. Ontology automatically connects the wallet to dapps for use. Ontology solved mobile DeFi with ONTO wallet.


This became longer than I intended. I like talking about alts and have a lot to say about them. Feel free to comment, what do you like about these? What projects do you like that I didn‚Äôt mention and why? Feel free to have a discussion."

It's a project that was awarded CRV from the CurveDAO treasury, and it is a staking service built on top of Curve finance.

It is built to increase capital efficiency on curve, by allowing people to earn trading fees and their crv boost, without having to do a lock period.

75% of the total supply is going to staking rewards between CRV pools and CVX pools.

Only 10% of the supply goes to the team, with 1 year vesting.

Yesterday, /u/EBur3F8h posted a great DD about the consequences of the cascading effects of the impeding margin calls ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ndmjjg/the\_infinity\_margin\_call/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ndmjjg/the_infinity_margin_call/)), although it was flaired as a discussion ‚Äì and a great discussion did start in the comments. /u/InterestingJacket222 objected that we could learn about the behavior of institutions among each other from the Archegos liquidation, which I found a very good observation. Indeed it is very helpful to look into game theory. Please let me dive deeper into this to see what we could expect and why we are in a way better position than sheer numbers tell.

It looks like there‚Äôs tons of forum sliding going on with memes today so I expect this post to get buried quickly, but maybe some apes will still get their eyes on it. Please cross- and repost this if that‚Äôs the case because I feel this can inspire some confidence in addition to BUY HODL VOTE.

# Houston we have a problem

The absolutely brilliant Houston Wade explained in one of his videos that the ideal outcome to defuse the overshorted time bomb is for them to find a way to flatten the curve. Here‚Äôs the full video, please go over to him and drop him a like and subscribe because I think he‚Äôs one of the smartest apes there are ‚Äì and he‚Äôs very funny, too ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGFwaRWjNM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGFwaRWjNM)). 

[They would prefer to flatten the curve](https://preview.redd.it/vmfz7peqqpz61.png?width=1666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff3b088ce1a638940ace55cc4378b300a94eceb0)

I think he‚Äôs absolutely right, that‚Äôs the logical response strategy. In this post I want to argue why I am certain they are not able to flatten the curve and hence avoid high stock prices even if they all want to. They simply won‚Äôt have that choice. The answer lies within game theory.

# A beautiful mess

I‚Äôm sure most of you are aware of the movie ‚ÄúA Beautiful Mind‚Äù. The movie is about John Forbes Nash Jr. who discovered the some of the most fundamental theorems about game theory ‚Äì most notably the Nash Equilibrium ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash\_equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium)). 

If players make an agreement without strict rules guaranteeing the following of the agreement by each single player, automatically the question arises if it is beneficial maybe for one player to break the agreement for his own benefit. If anyone wants to dive deeper into this setting mathematically, please take a look into the Cournot Competition ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cournot\_competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cournot_competition)), it‚Äôs basically the same principle and I think we can apply a one-turn based model to this situation because the stakes of the MOASS are so high that it‚Äôs a win-or-die situation.

If the entire finance industry came together to coordinate, they would have to find the sweet spot at which they all combined win the most, or in our situation lose the least ‚Äì that‚Äôs essentially the Nash Equilibrium. As the market is very intransparent, they would have to disclose their assets to each other and trust in everyone complying. 

First of all, this would be a cartel which is highly illegal, even for them. But it might be safe to assume the system is fraudulent enough to allow that to happen. So can this happen? 

Assuming most of them are very na√Øve and the others can be certain they stay loyal to the agreement, what will those others do to get their annual bonus payments? They will maximize their own profit by selling first. 

Coming back to /u/InterestingJacket222 ‚Äòs comment about the Archegos liquidation: Let‚Äôs say we narrow the players down to Goldman Sachs, Merryl Lynch and Credit Suisse. Goldman Sachs indeed has proven themselves as true backstabbers in the past by frequently being the first to sell out in such a situation. Credit Suisse were the bagholders in the Archegos situation but maybe they‚Äôre more careful in the future ‚Äì especially now that they‚Äôre positively spooked. So through this situation alone, we have a huge amount of mistrust between the players before the MOASS even started. 

[Karma, baby!](https://preview.redd.it/f0kmy6dgrpz61.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2019d08abc2fa0332b82bda4d2b8b2754a639528)

# Miracles

So we can assume that it is almost impossible for the clearing houses to get a working cartel together to get out of the MOASS breathing together. Maybe not even because they are all bad people, I‚Äôm not interested in judging on that ‚Äì but the stakes in this are so high that maybe only the first to break it has even a chance to survive and get his company and employees to see another day. On top of that, looking forward they can get rid of some competition that way. This makes the likelihood of a cartel forming almost utopian for them to even consider.

Now, our esteemed Michael Burry already tweeted about the MOASS back when he still was allowed to warn the public:

So the entire setup for the MOASS already is a black swan event, meaning an unforeseen event that‚Äôs very unlikely to occur ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_swan\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory)). 

[Black swan event](https://preview.redd.it/pe3abbvbrpz61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f238d757ef4b1d48c7f6c64b05845acd2f39340c)

Alright, now let‚Äôs pull these pieces together. To do this, we need to apply the principles of Boolean Algebra ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean\_algebra\_(structure)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_(structure))). This means in essence to cumulate the probabilities of the steps ‚Äì in this case of a MOASS to happen and of a working bank cartel to form during a margin call. BTW, let‚Äôs not forget that there most likely will be lots of cascading margin calls. Just for visualization purposes, let‚Äôs say the probability for a MOASS to occur in any given year is 0,1%. This is too high because we‚Äôre not talking about a regular short squeeze but about one where the underlying asset is shorted above 100%. These circumstances have NEVER happened before but as the probability obviously isn‚Äôt 0 let‚Äôs go with 0,1%. For the second part let‚Äôs assume 10% - also way too high as argued before but better safe than sorry.

0,1% \* 10,0% = 0,01%

So in this overcautious example, we‚Äôd still have a 99,99% chance for our tendies. You might object that the MOASS part already occurred and you‚Äôre right with that ‚Äì if you‚Äôre really strict you can only take the cartel part. But still we must not forget how unlikely the foundational situation is we are in. Miracles are unlikely but miracles within miracles? Nah!

**TL/DR:** It is highly unlikely for clearing houses to not eat each other because it would be against their nature and interest.

**TA/DR:** Hedgies fukd, buy hodl vote"

The new DeFi tokens reportedly include 1inch (1INCH), Bancor (BNT), Curve Finance (CRV), Ren (REN), and Sushiswap (SUSHI).

M√≥nica writes in a blog post that DeFi investments have ‚Äúgrown at an explosive rate with the equivalent of more than $75 billion currently locked‚Äù across the ecosystem. That‚Äôs notably more than 9x the value when Anchorage added support for Uniswap, Yearn, and others towards the end of 2020.

Guy Benartzi, Co-Founder, Bancor Protocol, stated:

‚ÄúAnchorage Digital has proven itself as a smart infrastructure provider with its eye on the future, which we at Bancor firmly believes is DeFi. With Anchorage‚Äôs custody support, more institutions can securely access BNT.‚Äù
Anchorage has been a key supporter of DeFi, from their governance and staking services for institutional investors, to their early and ‚Äúnumerous custody integrations for DeFi tokens, to making DeFi investment accessible by custodying assets for partners as we did for the Bitwise DeFi crypto index fund,‚Äù the announcement noted.

As previously reported, 1inch is a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator platform that ‚Äúmakes it easy to find the best exchange rates across Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.‚Äù DEX aggregators like 1inch ‚Äúeliminate the need to manually compare prices across multiple exchanges.‚Äù

1inch was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov and introduced its platform last year, with funding from Binance Labs, Galaxy Digital and Pantera Capital. 1INCH is the native governance and utility ERC-20 token.

As covered, Bancor is ‚Äúone of the earliest DEX innovators, having created the first Automated Market Maker (AMM) on Ethereum in late 2016.‚Äù The protocol provides automated token trading via its contracts, while ‚Äúallowing token holders to earn passive income as a liquidity provider by depositing their tokens in the protocol.‚Äù

Bancor‚Äôs latest version, v2.1, enables users ‚Äúto provide liquidity with single-token exposure and full protection from impermanent loss.‚Äù The Bancor Network Token (BNT) is an ERC-20 token that ‚Äúacts as the common reserve token in each decentralized trading pair on Bancor, and may be used for governance, liquidity provision and borrowing.‚Äù

As previously reported, Curve is an exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum ‚Äúdesigned for efficient stablecoin trading and low risk supplemental rewards for liquidity providers.‚Äù CRV is an ERC-20 governance and utility token that was introduced in August of last year ‚Äúto reward liquidity providers and allow for governance of Curve‚Äôs Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).‚Äù

Curve‚Äôs DAO will ‚Äúallow liquidity providers to vote on protocol decisions such as adding new pools.‚Äù

Ren is ‚Äúan open protocol that enables the permissionless transfer of value between blockchains.‚Äù

Ren‚Äôs core product, RenVM, ‚Äúbrings interoperability to DeFi by making it simple to transfer any token between blockchains.‚Äù RenVM ‚Äúcurrently connects Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Zcash, Filecoin, Terra, DigiByte, and Dogecoin to both Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain with plans to add more blockchains in the future.‚Äù

REN is an ERC-20 token that is ‚Äúrequired to run a validator node on the RenVM network. Ren was founded by software engineers  Zhang and Loong Wang back in 2017.

Launched in September 2020, SushiSwap is ‚Äúa community-led cryptocurrency exchange focused on DeFi.‚Äù On SushiSwap, token holders can ‚Äútrade, lend, borrow, and power decentralized applications (dApps).‚Äù

SUSHI is an ERC-20 token used to ‚Äúreward staking and liquidity providers and for governance of important protocol decisions.‚Äù Based on Uniswap, SushiSwap was created ‚Äúto improve on Uniswap‚Äôs design by adding more community-based features.‚Äù

If you‚Äôre interested in holding or gaining exposure to 1INCH, BNT, CRV, REN, and/or SUSHI, the Anchorage team can help. If you want to learn more about the company‚Äôs products and services, check here.

So I've been following crypto for a while off and on since 2014 and have been looking more frequently since 2019. I've only jumped in to it the start of this year with a purchase of 5,100plus DOGE coins at before the first spike of the year. I'm pretty happy so far with net investment, if we can call it that. 

I'm looking to see what the general consensus is for 5 or up to 10 crypto types/ names as I'm looking to make some long term gains as well as HODL 2 or there of them because I truly believe this may be ((THE)) future of finance. 

So......... what are some that are already established that would be best to ""invest"" in as well as what are some ""on the rise"" alt coins?

Would love to here any and ALL thoughts about the subject, no matter how far fetched. 

I'm just an APE who works night shifts married with 3 small children and looking to try to be ahead of the curve and have financial stability and longevity. 

THANKS to any and everyone who helps."

Triterras owns a platform that brokers deals for trade financing. They are trying to make it easy and transparent to get financing in an area that is getting continually more complex.

Additionally, they're one of the only fintechs that have been turning a profit since inception.¬†  
It's a very profitable start-up, with nice growth curve, virtually no debt, high net margins, most of the shares are held by insiders and institutions, which means little float left for the general public.  


With the use of blockchain, kratos is the most innovative commodities trading platform, if triterras could build a similar platform to trade stocks, this would revolutionize the trading world and would make triterras one of the most important companies in the fintech space worth Trillions in a decade.

Management showed they are willing to do share buybacks wich are my favorite type of investor payback.

First time using Polygon.. thoughts from a polygon newb,https://www.reddit.com/r/maticnetwork/comments/nevmvs/first_time_using_polygon_thoughts_from_a_polygon/,singinggary,1,2021-05-18 07:51:45,40,/r/maticnetwork/comments/nevmvs/first_time_using_polygon_thoughts_from_a_polygon/,NaN,"Long time ETH user wanted to see what all the hype was about. 

1. The bridge. I moved some USDC over the polygon bridge which was pretty simple and straight forward using metamask. Gas fee in ETH cost me around $30 to move funds over to polygon. 

2. Aave deposit try #1. I went to aave and saw the matic rewards were best if I deposited USDT so I quick swapped my USDC over to USDT. Cost me around $6 in liquidity fees but the matic gas price was next to nothing (awesome!) 

3. Aave deposit try #2. Deposited my new USDT to aave which failed because I didn‚Äôt have enough gas. I was surprised that the .001 matic didn‚Äôt get me very far. I saw the deposit to aave wanted .001 matic which was higher than I had read but still very cheap. I quick swapped $1 worth of USDT to matic (imagine doing that on the ETH network) which gave me pleeeenty of matic for gas (probably enough to last me a year or more ‚Äî horray!) 

4. Deposit to aave and borrow. Went back to aave and deposited my usdt then tried to borrow against it so I could deposit more into the curve finance aave pool for even more matic rewards.  Aave wouldn‚Äôt let me borrow against my USDT (huh!?!). After researching for a while I found out aave won‚Äôt allow borrowing against usdt (annoying , wish they had warned me prior but oh well). 

5. Withdrew all my usdt from aave and quick swapped it back into USDC which cost me another few dollars in liquidity fee (grrrr). 

6. Finally got the USDC deposited to aave and now I‚Äôm able to borrow. I saw dai had low borrowing rates and good rewards so I borrowed enough to keep my loan health around 1.5. 

7. Went over to curve finance polygon and put my newly borrowed dai into the aave liquidity pool. Matic rewards there are crazy (around 30% apy). 

8. Finally can relax and sit back and watch my money work for me. 

Overall I was impressed at the speed of transactions on polygon and the fees are fantastic. If I tried to do all this on EThereum network I would have paid hundreds of dollars in fees (compared to the pennies in fees I probably paid on polygon. The fees were so cheap I wasn‚Äôt even paying attention after a while).  Final conclusion ‚Äî we‚Äôre super early days. Some of the UI UX is clunky and the process can be overwhelming to a crypto beginner. But The hype is real and the future of defi looks very bright on polygon !"

I know applying early is good because there's more positions to fill and you're generally getting ahead of the curve, but at the same time I will be missing out on a lot of internship experiences to talk about in interviews by not waiting.

For example, JP Morgan's IB Analyst internship program just opened. Should I wait until i'm a month into my internship? 2 weeks? June 1st? Or should I just apply now and list myself as an incoming Finance Intern on my resume?"

I'm trying to do my due diligence for each coin/ token before even contemplating putting any money into it going forward (who are the developers, partnerships, marketing, media posts, utility, tokenomics etc etc.) And on top of this I'm trying to learn from the ground up for crypto in general. Going through Twitter, youtube, and crypto news articles every day on top of trying to learn as much as possible for each new project I come across has become very... cumbersome and feels very inefficient. Even putting in 2-3 hours a day doing this, it feels like I'm getting no where.

50 crypto terms you should know,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nh6lzx/50_crypto_terms_you_should_know/,Fantastic-Cucumber-1,1,2021-05-21 01:43:57,449,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nh6lzx/50_crypto_terms_you_should_know/,FINANCE,"If you're just getting started with crypto, or are struggling with all the terms that go around on this subreddit, this list is for you. 

Behold the top 50 crypto terms you should know!

&amp;#x200B;

* **51% attack (51% attack)**

A 51% attack represents the situation where more than half of the computing power within a given blockchain of one person or one concentrated group. This ensures that this group gains full control over this blockchain. For example, they can stop all mining, stop all transactions or spend every coin of this specific blockchain infinitely often.

* **Address**

A cryptocoin address is the location where you store your crypto coins and from where you send and receive your coins. You could compare it with your home address. This address usually consists of a whole row of numbers and digits, which looks something like this: 1KXghhUZRVFmfk9Jreo3vvuV3HDoCJyYJZ. This address is the public part of the two encrypted keys (see private and public key) that are required for the holder to verify a transaction.

* **Airdrop**

This is a kind of giveaway for founders who determine a particular cryptocurrency, giving those coins or coins away. The promotion is for a short period. This is done to publicize the tokens and distribute the tokens.

* **Altcoin**

This name is used for all crypto coins that are not Bitcoin (alternative coins).

* **Altseason**

This is the term given when money flows to altcoins faster than Bitcoin. In other words, when investors buy more altcoins than Bitcoin.

* **AMA**

Ask me something. A (mostly) new crypto project likes a session for users to ask them questions about the project. Reddit and Discord are often used for this.

* **AMM**

Automated Market Maker. That is to say, it is a kind of decentralized exchange platform (DEX). A mathematical formula is used to price assets. In a traditional exchange, it works differently, and assets are priced according to a price algorithm.

* **Arbitration**

Buying and selling the same asset on two exchanges to take advantage of small price differences.

* **ASIC mining / miner**

ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit. This is, in fact, a chip that is specially designed to perform one specific task. For this reason, thanks to ASIC mining, you can mine coins a lot faster than a regular computer or laptop could. For example, for Bitcoin, there are special ASIC miners who are only concerned with solving the SHA-256 algorithm. There are also crypto coins that are impossible to mine with an ASIC.

* **ATH**

ATH means All Time High. This is the highest price a cryptocurrency has ever achieved.

* **Bag**

A bag in the crypto world refers to the coins and tokens that you hold as part of your wallet. Typically, the term is used to describe a significant portion of a particular cryptocurrency. For example, a 'moon bag' is filled with the coins you currently own that you think will make you rich.

* **Bear market**

A bear knocks everything down with its claws. That is why a market where the trend is in a downward movement is called a bear market. Sentiment is then negative and prices predominantly fall.

* **Blockchain**

A blockchain is a kind of digital ledger of transactions that works from a decentralized network. Thanks to cryptography, a ledger can be kept by a large number of computers that together create the network. Every time a new transaction is made, it is added by the miners with date, size, etc. to the blockchain as a new block.

* **Block**

The blocks are the ""pages"" in the digital ledger of the blockchain. These are files with immutable data that are permanently stored on the blockchain.

* **Block reward**

The block reward is the reward that miners receive for finding a mathematical solution related to that block. With Bitcoin, this reward is 25 Bitcoins per mined block. This halves every 210,000 blocks.

* **BTFD**

Buy the f \* cking dip! This term is used when the price of a cryptocurrency or the market is in a dip. People are inclined to leave because they are afraid of losing. But a dip offers opportunities to buy a coin or token cheaply before it starts to rise again.

* **Buy the Dip**

Same as BTFD only without the expletives.

* **Bull market**

A bull stabs its horns and throws you up. That is why a Bull Market is a market where the trend is in an upward movement. Prices are rising and sentiment is positive.

* **Cold storage**

Cryptocurrency is stored offline. You do this if you want to safely store coins for a longer period of time. A hardware wallet is an example of cold storage.

* **Cryptography (cryptography)**

Also called secret writing. This focuses on techniques for hiding or encrypting information to be sent so that it is impossible for anyone accessing the channel on which it is sent to find out what information was sent.

* **Cryptocurrency**

A kind of digital currency based on cryptography. This concerns both Bitcoin and other altcoins.

* **DAO**

A DAO is a ""decentralized autonomous organization"" and can be described as an open source blockchain protocol governed by a set of rules, created by its elected members, that automatically perform certain actions without the intervention of intermediaries.

* **dApps**

These are decentralized applications (dApps) are digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or P2P network of computers rather than a single computer, and are beyond the reach and control of a single authority.

* **DeFi - Decentralized Finance**

DeFi, or decentralized financing, is a new way to conduct financial transactions through applications. It excludes traditional financial institutions and intermediaries and is run through the blockchain. Think of it as removing brokers, exchanges, banks and other middlemen from the equation.

* **DEX**

A DEX is a Decentralized Exchange or a decentralized exchange. Decentralized exchanges are a type of cryptocurrency exchange that allows direct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions to take place online securely and without an intermediary. No identification is required at these exchanges.

* **Distributed &amp; Central Ledger**

A distributed ledger is an agreement of shareable, shared, and synchronized data, which in this case is spread across several networks. These networks are then distributed over many computers.

With a central ledger, the synchronized and shareable data is controlled by one network or individual.

* **Double Spending**

This means that a particular cryptocoin can be spent more than once. This stops the blockchain from working.

* **Dust Transaction**

A transaction of extremely few coins that represents almost no value, but takes up space on the blockchain.

* **ECDSA**

Elliptic Curve Digitial Signature Algorithm is a lightweight cryptographic algorithm used to sign transactions on the Bitcoin protocol.

* **ERC20 token**

An ERC20 token is in some ways comparable to Bitcoin, Litecoin and any other cryptocurrency; these tokens are assets based on blockchain technology. They have value and you can send and receive them. ERC20 tokens are only issued on the Ethereum network.

* **Escrow**

A concept in which financial assets are held by a third party to protect them during an asynchronous transaction.

* **Fiat money**

Currencies that were once backed by gold (golden standard). Currently it only has value because people value it.

* **FOMO**

""Fear Of Missing Out"". This often occurs when a cryptocurrency increases in value so quickly that people are afraid that they will miss the boat to riches, causing the price per coin to be even higher.

* **FUD**

""Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt"". This crypto term is often used to describe the volatility of the crypto market.

* **Fork (branch / split)**

A fork happens when an alternate operational version of the current blockchain separates permanently. This can be done in three different ways:

* By a 51% attack
* Because there is a bug in the program
* Because new substantial changes have to be made to the current blockchain.
* **Genesis block**

The block mined first in a blockchain

* **Halving**

This means that the minable reward (see block reward) is halved. This happens every time with a certain amount of mined blocks. With Bitcoin, for example, this is for every 210,000 blocks.

* **Hash**

A mathematical process that takes a variable number of data as input and produces a shorter result of a fixed length.

* **Hashrate**

This is the speed at which the math problems for certain blocks can be solved. In other words, the speed at which a new block can be discovered. ASIC mining, for example, causes the hash rate to go down.

* **HODL**

Originally 'Hold' was meant, but in a tipsy mood a chat participant kept talking about how he was 'hodling' his coins. This quickly became a meme and now it has become established in the crypto world and means holding onto your crypto coins for the long term. Sometimes it also refers to 'Hold on for dear life'.

* **ICO**

Stands for Initial Coin Offering. This is a form of crowdfunding, where the public can invest in a blockchain startup in advance. As a thank you for the financial support they are rewarded with a certain amount of coins.

* **IEO**

This is an Initial exchange offer. It is a variant of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), managed directly by cryptocurrency exchanges.

* **KYC**

This stands for 'Know Your Customer'. It refers to the verification process that customers must go through to verify their identity and associate it with a cryptocurrency wallet. Crypto exchanges gain a better understanding of the potential client's activities and can determine whether or not they are legal in nature. A legal requirement for many central exchanges (CEX) to admit customers to their fair.

* **Mining**

Mining is the crypto term used to search for new block rewards. For finding and solving blocks, a reward is given to the miner.

* **Moon**

When a cryptocurrency ""goes to the moon,"" it means people think its price will rise exponentially.

* **Multisig (multiple signatures)**

Multisignature is a form of technology that ensures that extra security is added to Bitcoin transactions. Multisiganature addresses require another user to sign the transaction before it can be added to the blockchain.

* **NFT**

An NFT is a Non-fungible Token. They are unique and cannot be exchanged. They live on the blockchain.

* **Node**

A node is a computer connected to the crypto network that uses a client tasked with validating and tracing transactions. Each node receives a copy of the current blockchain, which is automatically downloaded when it joins the Bitcoin network.

* **P2P**

This stands for peer-to-peer. A (crypto) term that refers to computers that directly build a network with each other without a central server in between.

* **Privacy coin**

These are a class of cryptocurrencies that enable private and anonymous blockchain transactions by obscuring their origin and destination. Some of the techniques used include hiding a user's real wallet balance and address, and combining multiple transactions to circumvent chain analysis. Examples are Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC).

* **Private key**

A string of letters and numbers that is kept secret by the user. It is specially designed to sign a digital transfer using a public key. In the case of Bitcoin, this is a private key that must work with a public key.

* **Public key**

A string of letters and numbers that is public and can be viewed by anyone. This can be used in combination with a private key to sign a digital transaction.

* **Pump and Dump**

This is a crypto term used for the unethical process of pumping and dumping a relatively cheap coin. The coin is first obtained in a very cheap way by a certain group of persons who then ""pump"" the coin (make its value rise sharply) by advertising it a lot. When the coin has appreciated enough, they dump their coins with a lot of profit, leaving a large group at a loss.

* **PoW**

Stands for Proof-of-Work. This is a system that links computing power with mining capacity. The more powerful your computer can mine, the more you will be rewarded for this.

* **PoS**

Stands for Proof-of-Stake. This is a system that links the interest in a particular crypto coin to the mining capacity. This means that the more tokens you own of a particular crypto coin, the more you can mine this coin.

The PoW and the PoS are both consensus algorithms. With this mechanism you can organize as a user, but also machines, in a distributed environment. All agents, the nodes of a blockchain, must agree on a single source of truth. Even if some of the nodes fail. This means that the system must be fault tolerant.

* **DPos**

Stands for Delegated Proof-of-Stake. This is a variant of Proof of Stake that uses supernodes or masternodes to approve transactions.

* **Scam coin**

A coin created for the sole purpose of making the creator of this coin rich (usually through pump and dump).

Often this is accompanied by a Pyramid scheme. A pyramid scheme is a business model that recruits members through a promise of payments or services to enroll others in the scheme, rather than providing investment or selling products.

* **SHA-256**

The cryptographic algorithm used for Bitcoin's PoW system.

* **Signature**

A signature is a mathematical process by which someone can prove that he / she is the owner of his / her wallet. For example, a ""private key"" is used.

* **Smart Contract**

A two-way smart contract is an immutable agreement that is recorded on the blockchain, containing specific logical actions that are comparable to a ""normal"" contract. Once this contract has been signed, it can never be changed again. A smart contract can be used to set certain benchmarks that must be met in exchange for money.

* **Wallet**

See ""address""

* **Whale**

A whale is someone or a company that owns a large percentage of a particular crypto coin. It is often the case that a whale can also manipulate the price of this crypto coin.

* **Whitepaper**

A document that describes in detail the protocol of the crypto currency.

* **Yield Farming**

Yield farming, this is also known as liquidity mining. This allows you to generate a way for rewards with cryptocurrency holdings. In simple terms, this means locking cryptocurrencies and receiving rewards. This happens on DeFi projects."
What is Unit Protocol and why does it matter?,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/nhcs27/what_is_unit_protocol_and_why_does_it_matter/,ProfitExcellent8574,1,2021-05-21 06:00:53,8,/r/defi/comments/nhcs27/what_is_unit_protocol_and_why_does_it_matter/,NaN,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) plays an increasingly important role in the Ethereum ecosystem with the adoption of classic financial operations such as borrowing, lending, and various derivative issuance, as well as instruments with stable value(stablecoins) creation. DeFi is in the early stages of existence, and the overall efficiency and variety of decentralized services are low compared to the fiat financial world.

*Processing img 33ayv2yykc071...*

However, the programmable and decentralized nature of such services provides the potential for massive growth in the coming years. Decentralized financial services have different purposes and functionality, but their token economic models are mostly weak(such as simple governance token economic models) and do not allow long-term value capture. The majority of their token value is based on speculation without sustainable organic drivers.

Stablecoins are an important driver in DeFi adoption and development. The rise of stablecoins can be explained by the long downtrend in the market. During the time crypto assets holders were looking for the ability to keep the value of their crypto without touching fiat currencies and later simplify their ability to move the value back from stability to volatile coins.

Centralized stablecoin platforms contain a risk of censorship, reducing their long-term viability. Some services also face problems related to questionable asset management practices and the possibility of off-chain assets being frozen or taken by governments. More ‚Äúcompliant‚Äù centralized services can blacklist addresses and freeze accounts, increasing transaction censorship risk.

The Unit protocol allows users to obtain liquidity from a large variety of decentralized assets. The protocol increases borrowing efficiency by expanding the number of crypto assets available for collateralization, and asset holders can use the value contained in a diverse set of token hold- ings to mint the stablecoin $USDP. The liquidation mechanism stabilizes the entire system and provides economic incentives to liquidity providers.

A stable borrowing rate with no issuance fees increases user confidence. An organic token economic model connects the growth of the protocol to token value flows. A flexible approach to oracles gives users the option to select their preferred data provider. These solutions can significantly increase the capacity of a borrowing protocol and provide higher utility for users.

***In one sentence, Unit Protocol is a decentralized protocol that allows you to mint stablecoin $USDP using a variety of tokens as collateral.*** There are several tokens used in system:   
USDP - Stablecoin   
DUCK - Governance token   
COL - Old token, COL &gt; DUCK migration

**$USDP**

USDP address: 0x1456688345527bE1f37E9e627DA0837D6f08C925

USDP is a decentralized stablecoin currently live on the Ethereum network. The Unit Protocol incentivizes users to increase or decrease the USDP token supply based on supply and demand and ensures its value stays pegged to 1 USD.  
The token contract conforms to the ERC20 token standard which allows wallets, exchanges, and other applications to easily integrate with minimal effort. Non-standard functions of USDP token are described below.The Unit protocol allows users to obtain liquidity from a large variety of decentralized assets.

*In one sentence, Unit Protocol is a decentralized protocol that allows you to mint stablecoin $USDP using a variety of tokens as collateral.* There are several tokens used in system: USDP - Stablecoin DUCK - Governance token COL - Old token, COL &gt; DUCK migration

In Unit protocol, every USDP is fully backed by provided collateral. If the debt/collateral ratio exceeds a Liquidation Ratio(LR) for a Collateralized Debt Position(CDP), it will be subject to liquidation. Anyone can trigger liquidation by sending a trigger transaction. There are liquidation bots that consistently monitor CDPs and trigger liquidations if the stated condition is met.

After a CDP is triggered for liquidation, a Dutch auction starts for underlying collateral with a linear decrease in price. (the price decremental step can be different for various assets, but for the most amount of assets it is \~0.09% decrease per block).

Every participant can buyout the part of the collateral for the current price by paying the USDP debt for a liquidated CDP. USDP debt is equal to borrowed USDP amount plus the liquidation fee in % from this amount.  
After collateral realization, the remaining part is returned to the borrower's address. His USDP debt is burned, and the liquidation fee is sent to the governance pool address for fee distribution.

**DUCK**

DUCK address: 0x92e187a03b6cd19cb6af293ba17f2745fd2357d5

The DUCK token is the governance token and core token of the Unit Protocol economy.  
Unit protocol collects stability fees when users repay their USDP and liquidation fees if CDPs were liquidated. The governance pool plays a significant role in Unit Protocol decision-making system and add stability to the system, so it is essential to incentivize DUCK stakers and help them be involved in the voting process.

Unit protocol needs price data for system contracts to know the current price of provided collaterals. It is necessary to count borrowing parameters and manage collateralized debt positions (CDPs) in the protocol.

We use Keep3r oracle as the primary oracle to receive our collaterals' price in ETH and Chainlink oracle to receive ETH price. Keep3r provides time-weighted Uniswap &amp;&amp; Sushiswap price feed with a specific time period.

Additionally to the solution, in reserve, we have our oracle solution - Keydonix(also based on uniswap price feed), as well as Chainlink oracle for token prices.

**Unit Protocol &amp; Component**

During the Unit protocol development, we faced difficulty finding a reliable, flexible protocol for stablecoin swap without interface censorship.

Many swap protocols implement governance to make decisions about pools creating or listing new tokens. It is a reasonable approach if adding a new element to the system would influence of reliability of the whole protocol, but under the condition that each pool is separated element censorship approach may be a huge limitation for protocol growth.  
For example, Uniswap is very convenient because anyone can list any token, and the default interface will work without any governance process or listings censorship.

But Uniswap, due to its bonding curve, is not suitable for a similar peg assets swap because of high slippage and there is no protocol flexibility to make adjustments to the default model.

Component aims to provide flexible pool settings suitable for any token project, freedom of pools creation, and fair community protocol governance token distribution.  
The Component governance token will be distributed retrospectively to the liquidity providers of core pools after a 1-3 month period.

You can track potential distribution rewards in real-time via https://distribution.component.finance/.

Rewards for an address are proportional to the amount of liquidity provided to Component farming pools relative to the total provided liquidity for every block.  
As an example, if a user provides 100 USD liquidity and for the block total amount of liquidity is equal to 10,000 USD, then he will receive 1% of total rewards for the block, if for the next block total liquidity increased to 20,000 USD, he will get 0.5% of total rewards for the next block.

There are no certain conditions set so far about the whole structure of distribution, and information about distribution parameters will be announced later. *The reward period started from the 27th Jan 2021.*

‚ùìWhat is Lixir?

üëâLixir is a liquidity concentration manager and incentivizer that maximizes your returns in the next generation of AMMs.

‚ùìWhat is a liquidity concentration manager?

üëâIt's a program that pools assets from users and automatically rebalances the concentration of your liquidity as price moves to maximize ROI on the next generation of AMMs like Uniswap v3. Liquidity concentration managers do two main things in these systems:

1. incentivize new liquidity to come in so that rebalancing is possible when the price of a pair moves.
2. automatically manage those rebalancings and incentives so that users earn fees and LP rewards as consistently as possible

‚ùìWhat about gas fees?

üëâLixir uses an algorithm similar to that of Uniswap v2 to track pool ownership. For each re-balance, it calculates the total amount of asset value in a pair pool, at current prices. Then, for each incoming user, it calculates the value of the assets they are putting in, and mints pool tokens proportionally.

üëâAs a result, users only spend gas when entering or exiting the pool, and the gas costs are limited to calculating the value of their incoming/outgoing assets.

The fees to re-price the NFT on Uni v3 aren't too expensive, and are paid by the incoming users at each re-balance event, for which they are rewarded.

‚ùìDo I have impermanent loss risk?

üëâ tldr: yes, but not as much as you're used to. Normal IL risk is spread out along the whole price curve, whereas with liquidity concentration, the action happens in a narrower part of the curve.

Example: you concentrate liquidity for DAI/USDC between 0.99-1.01.

üëâIf the price moves to 1.01, you will be left with 100% USDC and 0 DAI, but the IL is low, because their prices are still so close to each other.

‚ùìSounds great! Are there any other risks with liquidity concentration?

üëâYes, rather than IL, the risk is that you won't earn fees or LP rewards when the price moves out of your range. You also won't be able to re-price/re-balance without adding more liquidity to the other side of the pair. Lixir is specifically designed to solve this problem, but the risk is there if you try to do this manually.

‚ùìWhen will Lixir be operational?

üëâ **APP GOES LIVE 22nd May 4pm UTC**

The APY itself on concentrated liquidity is already very competitive but once we enable farming on Monday the APY will increase remarkably!

First Pools: üíß  
\- LIX/ETH (highest cap)  
\- USDC/USDT  
\- ETH/USDC  
\- WBTC/renBTC  
\- WBTC/ETH

What's to come:  
\- Lix staking and farming  
\- Lix requirement to join farming  
\- Governance  
\- Single sided liquidity entrance  
\- Pool cap raising  
\- No pool cap after audit

‚ùì Is Lixir just for Uniswap?

üëâNo, it is for any AMM that implements liquidity concentrations. We expect several platforms to follow quickly, and we will expand the automated management to handle those use cases as they come online.

CoinEx‰∏®An Insight into NFT That Is Booming in Its Inroad into Other Industries,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coinex/comments/nhnihf/coinex‰∏®an_insight_into_nft_that_is_booming_in_its/,CoinExcom,1,2021-05-21 16:26:52,1,/r/Coinex/comments/nhnihf/coinex‰∏®an_insight_into_nft_that_is_booming_in_its/,NaN,"By: CoinEx Institution

Recently, the non-fungible token (NFT) has¬†frequently come to the spotlight of many industries.¬†It has gained popularity both at home and abroad. To be specific, eBay announced its plan to allow users to trade NFT on its¬†platform, a¬†skull painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat fetched as much as nearly 600 million NFT¬†at Christie‚Äôs, and RIMOWA even rolled out NFT digital art¬†outside its traditional business... What turns this¬†blockchain technology¬†into a new financial product that swept through the whole financial market overnight? NFT is like an interface¬†between investors and¬†the ""Pandora"" box of an open world. 

***While breaking boundaries of industries, NFT has heralded a new future***

NFT, short for Non-Fungible Token, is indivisible, irreplaceable, and unique.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1au5ojosff071.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6d062f28940083ae1b3cb05264c85e49f6b3f48

On the blockchain, digital cryptocurrencies are divided into two categories: coins and tokens. The former, such as BTC¬†and ETH, have their own mainchain and use transactions on the chain to maintain ledger data; tokens are attached to the existing blockchain and use smart contracts to record the ledger, such as¬†those developed on¬†Ethereum. Among the tokens, there are fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens.

The fungible token, or FT, can replace each other and can be infinitely split. For example, there is essentially no difference between the¬†BTC you have¬†and the¬†BTC I have, because BTC is a fungible token. Fungible¬†tokens are easy¬†to use, but things with actual value in real life are irreplaceable, such as a contract, house property rights, works of art,¬†and¬†birth certificates. Then non-fungible¬†tokens came as a response.

The non-fungible¬†token, or¬†NFT, is¬†unique and indivisible. Its uniqueness usually links it¬†to specific assets in the real world and can be used to prove the ownership¬†of digital items (such as game skins)¬†and¬†even the ownership of physical assets.

# The two underlying protocol standards of NFTs

**ERC-721 Standard**

It was created and published by Dieter Shirley, CTO of CryptoKitties. Compared with the ERC-20, the ERC-721 protocol boasts¬†more functions and more advanced technology. This protocol is the first standard of Ethereum for NFT digital assets, and it is applied to projects such as CryptoKitties and Decentraland.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7oaq51hfhf071.png?width=1828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f37d9ef34ceae472b202d47abae023cc8f904d68

Although ERC-721 has fewer use cases than ERC-20 and its functions are still under exploration, it is advantageous in the¬†ability to secure the ownership of assets¬†(such as paintings, bonds, houses, or cars), make the transfer of the ownership convenient, and keep the ownership history tamper-resistant and transparent. In addition, ERC-721 can also facilitate the tracking, trading and management of real assets. With the increasing popularity of in-game¬†virtual assets¬†as well as¬†5G and VR¬†technologies, the ERC-721 protocol, equipped with blockchain technology, would definitely embrace¬†a bright future.

**ERC-1155 Standard**

ERC-1155 is a new token standard released by¬†Enjin, a¬†game development service provider. It aims to help game developers save capital¬†and promote atomic swaps to improve the trading efficiency between tokens. The¬†biggest improvement lies in¬†that it can integrate different tokens for packaging and processing.

In¬†the current token systems¬†of¬†ERC20 and ERC721, users need to go through four independent steps¬†for swaps, which is cumbersome and time-consuming. But with¬†the ERC-1155¬†Standard, users can bundle all the tokens they want to swap¬†in one contract, which requires¬†only one step of approval. In addition, single or multiple tokens can also be sent to single or multiple receiving addresses in one go, thus saving a lot of gas fees and improving efficiency.

**Comparison of the Two Major NFT Standards**

https://preview.redd.it/9cq62haejf071.png?width=1436&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=301a48f0576211fc4a91b9436a6109bfd418a5cf

Here is a simple example. When you shopped¬†on Taobao¬†in the past, you had to pay every time you bought something. But now you have ERC-1155, which serves as a shopping cart in Taobao, you just put whatever you want in it and then pay once. Isn‚Äôt it easy and time-saving?

*Yet still, it takes some time before we can assess¬†the application of this young standard.*

# NFT Applications¬†and Good Practices

There is a popular saying recently: ""*Anything could be owned through an NFT,*"" a vivid evidence of the extensive application¬†of NFT. 

As we know, most assets in the real world are non-fungible assets. To list these assets on the chain, or to find their corresponding digital form, NFT will be the most suitable standard. So we firmly believe that this will be the second largest application scenario of the blockchain beyond finance.

NFT can be applied to scenarios such as **digital artworks, collectibles, in-game items, virtual worlds, sports competitions, fashion entertainment, identity verification, insurance, infrastructure such as domain names, digitization of physical assets, and electronic tickets or coupons**. Simply put, it is mainly applied in games and digital art.

NFT based on blockchain technology can record a¬†player's status and achievements in the game, and in-game items such as weapons, equipment, and characters can all become NFTs. NFT can verify¬†the ownership of in-game items and their authenticity. It is now applied in games such as CryptoKitties, Axie Infinity and Aavegotchi.

Digital art is another mainstream application of NFT. Each artwork¬†can be presented in the form of NFT, which guarantees artists‚Äô copyright and the authenticity of the artwork for buyers. In addition, without¬†middlemen, artists or encryption art can earn more income. SuperRare, OpenSea and MakersPlace are all NFT art platforms. 

# Good Practices

* **Games**

Axie Infinity (AXS) is an NFT game similar to Pokemon that collects and raises all kinds of creatures. Players can earn tokens for profit through the game.

F1 Delta Time (REVV) is a blockchain game licensed¬†by Formula 1¬Æ. All its cars are officially licensed by Formula 1¬Æ. The NFT in the game includes unique cars, drivers, car parts, and driver equipment¬†or tires.

Illuvium (ILV) is a decentralized NFT collection and automatic battle game built on the Ethereum network.

* **Collectible artworks**

As a leader in the collectibles, NBA Top Shot,¬†developed on FLOW, has fetched a historical turnover of over US$320 million¬†within only half a year since its official launch,¬†far exceeding the last nine in the ranking list combined. It has become the fastest-growing NFT project.

CryptoPunks is the first-ever¬†experimental NFT application on Ethereum. There are 10,000 NFTs in total, and each is unique. Larva Labs, the development team of CryptoPunksd, gave¬†away 10,000 NFTs for free at the earliest, which pushed this project to a climax at that moment. Yet without sufficient¬†trading methods and a wallet plug-in compatible with¬†Web 3 explorer¬†applications, CryptoPunks was left idle. These days, however, CryptoPunks¬†seems to embrace a boom.¬†Up to now, it has created a historical turnover of US$98.848 million¬†and¬†served 10,286¬†buyers, with¬†the average selling price¬†approaching US$54,000.

Hashmasks is a digital art collectibles¬†project created by more than 70 artists around the world. It has a total of 16,384 NFTs, and each is a unique personal portrait. Users can purchase these portraits and name them. At the same time, each work has 5 scarce¬†elements, with different degrees of scarcity, which will be extracted at random by Hashmasks on the chain. Hashmasks even adopts a special way of auction‚Äîblind boxes, and¬†the auction price follows¬†the bonding curve model.

* **NFT trading platforms**

Opensea (no tokens listed¬†yet), known as the ""eBay of blockchain games"", is undoubtedly the leader in the trading market, and currently supports more than 13 million projects. In the world's largest NFT comprehensive trading market, users can trade encrypted¬†artworks, collectibles, in-game items, and other digital assets based on Ethereum ERC-721 and ERC-1155 Standards, by means of direct trading, Dutch auction, English auction, and OTC trading. Opensea will charge 2.5% of the sale price as a commission after the transaction, and some game developers¬†will also charge a transaction¬†fee of 7.5% of the transaction amount.

Rarible (RARI) is a creator-focused marketplace and issuance platform for NFTs¬†where users can create and sell digital collectibles without coding skills. In July 2020, Rarible listed¬†its native governance token RARI, which is allocated¬†according to users' weekly purchases and sales. Users can spend¬†these tokens on buying and selling¬†NFTs. The most active creators and collectors can even enjoy governance rights by holding RARI¬†to vote for the upgrade of any platform and participate in the management and review.

SuperRare (no tokens listed¬†yet), established in 2017, is undoubtedly the most ""disruptive"" in the entire NFT trading industry. Based on the Ethereum ERC721 Standard, SuperRare sets¬†a high threshold for artists. All works must be original, and artists will be reviewed once a week, which,¬†to a large extent,¬†guarantees the high quality¬†of the¬†encrypted artworks. At the same time, SuperRare's special incentive mechanism is¬†one of the important reasons for its continuous inflow of a large number of artists: artists can get 85% of income after selling their works for the first time and even 10% of¬†the sales volume in the secondary market permanently.

SuperRare has grown with leaps and bounds, with both user base and transaction volume on a rapid rise. It has fetched a¬†total transaction volume of over US$20 million and sold over 17,000 artworks, the average transaction price of each artwork being US$1,460.45.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Music**

Audius (AUDIO), a¬†decentralized music sharing and streaming protocol, is designed to promote direct transactions between listeners and creators, so that everyone can freely distribute, commercialize and stream any audio content. Founded in 2018, Audius is now home to over 3 million¬†monthly active users (MAUs) with over two¬†million streams across more than 100,000 tracks, and has cooperated¬†with artists such as deadmau5, 3LAU, and RAC.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Social Tokens**

Whale (WHALE), created¬†by the NFT giant WhaleShark in May 2020, is indirectly underpinned by all of NFTs in the crypto market. Players can stake¬†valuable NFT as collateral to obtain WHALE. These NFTs will be stored in The Vault of WHALE and are managed by Whale DAO. WHALE holders can also purchase or rent NFT works in The Vault.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Virtual Worlds**

Decentraland is a virtual world based on the Ethereum blockchain. It¬†is¬†similar to virtual world games such as ""Second Life""¬†in terms of design and operation. Decentraland allows users to create and run all¬†items and assets and profit from them. Users can buy ""LAND"" (by means of¬†Dutch auctions) and record the transaction history of this ""LAND"" on the chain. At the same time, Decentraland also has three types of applications, i.e. art galleries, virtual parties and virtual meetings.

Its token MANA can be used to purchase real estate and other items in the virtual world, such as artworks. MANA is¬†also among the new currencies invested by Grayscale.

The Sandbox is a decentralized virtual world game built¬†on the Ethereum blockchain, where creators can make 3D VOXEL assets and monetize them through non-fungible tokens.¬†In the future, The Sandbox may allow users to import a scan of real-world objects into it.

The Sandbox is one of the star projects of the current NFT ecosystem. Its total transaction volume in the first public sale¬†of 1,200¬†plots of LAND¬†this year reached US$74.9 billion. In the recent second sale¬†of another 2,302 plots of LAND, 1,078 plots¬†were sold in less than 1 minute.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Domain Names**

Ethereum Name Service is a distributed, open and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. Just like DNS resolves domain names into IP addresses, ENS resolves Ethereum names into Ethereum addresses. Once you acquire an ENS domain, you can point it to any kind of funds you want, as well as create subdomains, similar to Internet domain names.

Unstoppable Domains is a scalable, distributed and open naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. It has been backed¬†by Draper Associates and Boost VC, and has received funding from the Ethereum Foundation and Zilliqa Foundation.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Infrastructure**

Enjin¬†is¬†an established¬†blockchain game development platform. Its¬†CTO has developed ERC-1155, a new standard for Ethereum,¬†which makes it easy to develop games. The ERC-1155 Standard can even be applied to all the other industries. Amid its constant moves in the first year of the NFT era, Enjin has cooperated with the established game manufacturer Atari, and then Enjin Coin (ENJ) has been approved by the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange regulatory body. For the time being, Enjin¬†is about to launch the interoperable bridge network JumpNet (similar to¬†Polygon) and Efinity, which is Enjin‚Äôs public chain, in an attempt to ‚Äúredefine¬†the NFT market‚Äù. These two blockchain solutions will promote the support of NFT and completely eliminate the high gas fee of Ethereum.

FLOW¬†is¬†the hottest NFT public chain¬†for the time being. Dapper Labs, its creator, has developed the¬†sensational CryptoKitties, and its¬†CTO has developed¬†the ERC-721 Standard, laying a foundation for the NFT. With¬†a pipeline architecture, FLOW¬†can divide the jobs usually completed by a single node into five different node types, thereby significantly reducing redundant work and improving efficiency. A cryptographic technology called ‚ÄúSecurity Proof-of-Concept Keystone‚Äù¬†(SPoCK) will be adopted to better meet the needs of decentralized game applications. This method allows developers to safely and easily build on each other's code, creating new products and services at a faster rate. At present, many NFT art platforms and games are developed on FLOW. NBA Top Shot, which has¬†the largest NFT transaction volume,¬†is currently running on FLOW.

Immutable X (no tokens listed¬†yet) is a¬†dedicated¬†L2 solution for scaling NFTs on Ethereum built by the creator of Gods Unchained. It allows users to trade their NFTs without paying gas fees using what is known as a Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollup.¬†Aside from just the savings in gas fees, this provides a variety of benefits, including:

1.  Immutable X boasts self-custody of NFTs with the same level of security as mainchain Ethereum, something not seen in alternative scaling solutions.  
 Transactions are instant, and moving back to mainchain Ethereum is trustless and verifiable.
2. Unlike other Layer 2 solutions, users do not need to own a unique L2 token to trade¬†NFTs.
3. Immutable X will provide turing-complete general computation thanks to Cairo, technology developed by their partners over at StarkWare.
4. Concentrated¬†liquidity means that game assets are immediately available on all IMX-supported exchanges.

Immutable X has a strong lineup of investors: Naspers, Galaxy Digital, Coinbase, Continue Capital, etc.

In addition, there are Phantasma (SOUL), FORTE (no tokens listed yet),

Unique network (no tokens listed yet), and NFT chains based on Polkadot and Kusama¬†for games.

***NFT becomes a new carrier of value, with insight into the future of¬†blockchain technology***

At present,¬†the blockchain technology centering on NFT is injecting vitality into various fields. However, there remain many bottlenecks in the current ecological environment.

Compared with the popular DeFi ecosystem¬†previously, the NFT ecosystem still needs to be improved at this stage. Unlike¬†the¬†segments in the DeFi fields that share¬†similar business and investment logic, the niche market of the NFT is clearly differentiated, with projects varying a lot from each other, and only a small part of segments are fully fledged and worthy of investment. That has resulted¬†in insufficient synergy between NFT projects and the segments¬†and¬†thus¬†limited influence.

Many users shrink back at the sight of complex terms¬†such as private keys, wallets, and mnemonics involved in NFT. In addition, the emerging niche market of the NFT has poorer liquidity than DeFi projects.¬†Without prudent consideration, you may find it hard to sell the NFT of some items.

With a regulatory vacuum across the world, NFT is developing wildly. Tied to physical items, NFT may be used by criminals to launder money or trade things illegal. In addition, as the value of NFT mounts and the ecosystem gradually expands, it may become a new target for hackers after DeFi, and its network security vulnerabilities seem to be another potential risks¬†as well.

NFT, like DeFi last year, breaks the boundary of industries¬†once again, empowering multiple industries such as art, games, and cultural creation. Besides, the true significance¬†of NFT is to provide a channel¬†through which real-world items can be listed on the chain, as a bridge linking¬†the physical world¬†with¬†the blockchain world. Apart from the¬†existing in-game items,¬†art collectibles¬†and other applications, there will be more real assets,¬†such as real estate¬†and¬†copyrights, that can be listed on the chain in the form of NFT, giving rise to ever more diverse applications.

The emergence of NFT has brought brand-new changes to the ecosystem and business model of the entire industry, and high-quality assets will¬†keep improving market liquidity. First of all, it is expected that more high-quality comprehensive trading platforms will appear in the NFT field, providing users from all over the world with a place to mint or trade NFT.

Commercial bills such as bonds and insurance policies need to carry a large amount of information in circulation and transactions in the financial market, and, therefore, they are unique. NFT¬†is tied to¬†different physical objects, and the information of bills can be tracked. That means NFT can empower the financial industry, giving itself a bigger play in this field in the future. ¬†

Moreover,¬†DeFi can provide liquidity for NFT. High-quality and widely recognized NFT assets can be staked¬†in the DeFi contract so that users can purchase new assets after staking their¬†NFTs. Therefore, high-quality NFT assets will improve market liquidity.

Predictably, the coming¬†three to five years¬†will see¬†a market reshuffle in the NFT field. The winners will acquire and integrate NFT-related companies¬†to expand the user base and the business scale."

The past few years have seen a rise in the number of [**financial literacy apps for kids**](https://birdfin.app/). As parenting is becoming a little time-constrained, parents are choosing smart ways to spend more time with their kids. 

This digitally-driven world has many apps that have the potential to save money for your child. One of the most popular ones is Birdfin where a savings account is connected to the app and you can save your child‚Äôs money along with teaching them how to save.

Earlier children did not learn about money from a young age but today the parenting game has changed completely. These digital money apps for kids are like a [**kids allowance app**](https://birdfin.app/) that can help you keep a track of their money behavior when you give them their pocket money. 

There are plenty of ways to save money on behalf of your child but wouldn‚Äôt it be great if your child is a part of that process? The money apps for kids do exactly that. From teaching the importance of earning rightfully to saving the money for good, everything is monitored and taught through simple chores. 

The parents work hard on instilling good money habits in their child as debts and bad money management can be stressful. The pandemic has profoundly affected the financial aspect of many but only the ones with savings and investments have survived. 

Life is uncertain and teaching the child to deal with uncertainties should be started from an early age. Children have a quick learning curve at an early age and are inquisitive about everything that can be channelled for learning and applying knowledge. 

Financial awakening does not happen overnight; it is a process that takes place over the years. Instead of giving your child pocket money for doing nothing, make it look like they have to earn it. The financial apps use daily chores as tasks and the virtual money is the reward. 

The digital era has given many applications at our fingertips to encourage good habits in a child. Use them wisely! 

Mary Gresham, an Atlanta- based psychologist, specializing in finance and family, says that the right age to start with money education is between 4 to 5 years. For the longest time, Indian parents did not start early, but their opinions have changed over the years. The [**best chore app for kids**](https://birdfin.app/) is hands-down Birdfin as it simplifies the whole learning process. Remember, educating your child about money can be tricky and complicated but Birdfin is a fun way to uncomplicated the whole process."

The only issue is I got it through nepotism(my dad is good friends with the  CEO and multiple executives), and not on my own. To be honest I am really anxious and feel like an impostor as most of the other interns are going to be older than me and from better schools(I go to a non target flagship state school). 

The good news is I got a 3.94 GPA last semester and I‚Äôm majoring in Econ, and I think I have a good shot of transferring to at least a semi target. My dad keeps telling me that old school high finance is dead and anybody worth anything is doing some sort of blend of tech/quant and finance. He wants me to pursue a BS instead of a BA and I‚Äôm thinking of transferring to NYU tandon to do the business technology management major. Would this pigeon hole me into tech? Alternatives that I am looking at are Econ at Cornell, Econ at Vanderbilt, Econ CAS at NYU, etc. My dad went to stern but the transfer acceptance rate is ~2% so that‚Äôs not happening. To be quite frank I feel stuck.

My dream job is to work at a small boutique hedge fund, which of these degrees would be best? My dad says hedge funds are dying and I should get with the fintech startup trend and try to pursue a techie path to CTO and then start my own firm. Should I listen to him and apply to tandon even though it‚Äôs kind of looked down upon by other NYU students?

I‚Äôve considered IB but honestly reading into I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs for me it sounds horrible, my mom works in private equity and that sounds a little bit better but still soul crushing. I have a family friend who started a consulting firm and sold it for tens of millions. There is so much stuff on Wall Street and I feel scattered and overwhelmed, I am scared of pigeon holing myself into product management and IT by pursuing a tech degree, but at the same time people are telling me it‚Äôs better than Econ.

(continued from part 2) ...

The highly successful recompletions of the  ***Fulcher-Kutz Pictured Cliffs wells*** and the observance of methane gas from the overlying Fruitland Coal marked the beginning of the San Juan Basin development. The Denver office for AMOCO Production Company began a focused effort to evaluate the potential. A complete staff of geologists, production engineers, reservoir engineers, petroleum engineers, drilling and completion engineers, landmen, finance, and management formed a team to develop the coal gas.

Based on the combined team work, AMOCO chose a location not in the Fulcher-Kutz area, but north, close to the Colorado State line on Cedar Hill just off highway 550 to Durango Colorado.

&gt;Case history:  
&gt;  
&gt;The first well specifically for coal-bed methane in New Mexico was drilled in 1977 by Amoco Production Co. in the Cedar Hill field northeast of Aztec. The well was the Cahn #1 - an open hole test.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cedar Hill CBM field. Amoco Production Company completed the initial Fruitland coalbed gas well in this field in May 1977, producing from the thick (up to \~25ft, 7.6m) basal coal of this formation. Public records show that, as of 31 October 1993, the field had produced nearly 54BCF (1.5BCM) of gas from 23 producing Fruitland wells. During the month of October 1993, average daily production per well was approximately 714 MCF (20 MCM). The most productive wells in this field are characterized by high fracture permeability.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 1977, Amoco Production Company discovered the Cedar Hill field that produced CBM from Fruitland coal beds. Amoco was the first company in the Western US daring enough to produce large amounts of water from coal beds to stimulate CBM production. (( A direct result of the ***Fulcher-Kutz Pictured Cliffs well recompletions )).***  
&gt;  
&gt;The Amoco Cahn #1 well was reported to begin initial production of a few MCF of gas per day and many barrels of water. Over time, as the well de-watered, the gas increased to over 55 Million Cubic Feet of Gas Per Day. It was noted in part 2 of this 3 part series that coal bed methane increases and then decreases as a bell curve - graphs were illustrated.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 1988, the first year production records for the Basin Fruitland pool were kept, coal-bed methane production from the San Juan Basin of New Mexico was 14 billion cubic feet (BCF, : 0.014 TCF) from a year-end total of 77 wells. Annual production in 1989 increased to 55 BCF from 323 wells and in 1990 was 131 BCF from 734 wells. In December 1990, Fruitland coal-bed methane production made up about 31% of the monthly gas production from the San Juan Basin and 17% of the monthly gas production from all of the state of New Mexico.

The below graph clearly indicates the cumulative production of the Fruitland CBM (Coal Bed Methane) in relationship to all the other producing reservoirs in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico. Note the basin-wide Bell Curve.

Cumulative gas production was addressed in a published article  titled ""The San Juan Basin, a Complex Giant Gas Field, New Mexico and Colorado\* by James E. Fassett in Search and Discovery Article #10254 (2010, 2013) Posted October 18, 2013: Portions of the Abstract follow.

&gt;The San Juan Basin of northwest New Mexico and southwest Colorado is the second largest gas basin in the United States, second to the greater Hugoton Field of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas.  
&gt;  
&gt;Until the 1970s, most of the gas produced in the basin came from the three major fractured-sandstone reservoirs: the Dakota Sandstone, the Mesaverde Group, and the Pictured Cliffs Sandstone, all of Late Cretaceous age.  
&gt;  
&gt;Starting in the late 1970s \[*AMOCO*\], and accelerating in the 1980s to the present, production from coal-bed methane (CBM) reservoirs in the basin has gone from virtually none to around one trillion cubic ft of gas (TCFG)/year, making the San Juan Basin‚Äôs Fruitland CBM field the largest CBM field in the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;Through September 2009, the basin‚Äôs fractured-sandstone reservoirs produced 24.4 trillion cubic ft of gas (TCFG) from 24,000 wells: 7.0 TCFG from the Dakota Sandstone, 12.9 TCFG from the Mesaverde Group, and 4.5 TCFG from the Pictured Cliffs Sandstone. These three reservoirs have also produced 98.2 million barrels of natural-gas liquids (condensate).  
&gt;  
&gt;Fruitland Formation CBM production is 15.7 TCFG from 7,700 wells. Cumulative gas production from these natural-gas reservoirs is 40.1 TCFG. Cumulative gas production from all of the nearly 40,000 wells in the basin totals 42.7 TCFG with the additional 2.6 TCFG coming from the basin‚Äôs many scattered oil fields and smaller gas fields. note: CBM gas production represents 36.77% of total San Juan Basin production.

# Historical Coal Bed Methane Production - totally ignored and by-passed.

Coalbed methane in the USA: analogues for worldwide development by D. KEITH MURRAY D. Keith Murray &amp; Associates, Inc., 200 Union Boulevard, Suite 215, Lakewood, CO 80228-1830, USA  (date unknown)

\*\*\*Case history of a long-lived coalbed methane well.\*\*\*

Because of the relative infancy of the CBM industry, where well-documented production histories seldom exceed 10 years, a detailed case study by Hale &amp; Firth (1988) provides some important clues regarding the potential productive life of such wells.

The San Juan 32-7 Unit No. 6 well, San Juan County, New Mexico, is located in the Los Pinios Fruitland, South, pool, in T3N, R7W, NMPM, in the northern San Juan Basin. This well, originally designated the 6-17 San Juan 32-7 Unit, was completed by Phillips Petroleum Co. in August 1953. According to Hale &amp; Firth (1988), this Fruitland Formation (Upper Cretaceous) well has produced more than 1.364 BCF (0.04 MMCM) of gas over a period of 34 years (i.e. through 1987) with *no decline in rates or reservoir pressure.*

The original Phillips well was drilled to 3054 ft (931 m), at which point 7 inches (17.8 cm) casing was set. The drilling mud was removed and the well was drilled with gas to a total depth of 3240ft (988m) to provide a safe means of detecting any water and to protect against a large gas flow. At 3232 ft (985 m) a large flow of gas was noted, measuring as much as 2420 MCF/d (68.5MCM/d) at 3236ft (986m). Drilling continued to 3240 ft total depth, leaving a 187 ft (57m) open-hole section, which was not logged. The well registered an initial potential of 1790 MCF/d (51 MCM/d). The producing reservoir is moderately over-pressured, with a pressure gradient of 0.47 PSI/ft. Although this well was not logged, correlation with nearby logged wells leaves little doubt that the producing reservoir is a lower Fruitland coal bed approximately 40 ft (12.2m) thick.

Analyses of the produced gas demonstrate that it is typical pipeline quality coalbed gas: 94.24% methane, 4.97% carbon dioxide, 0.36% ethane and traces of nitrogen and heavier hydrocarbon gases, with an average BTU content of 969 BTU/SCF. Figure 7 \[*below*\] (after Hale &amp; Firth 1988) shows that the production rate of the 32-7 Unit No. 6 well has remained remarkably constant for about 30 years, between 150 and 180 MCF/d (4.2 and 5.1 MCM/ d), except for a few anomalous months. In the autumn of 1978, a 32-day pressure build-up test was conducted.

\----- **The extrapolated reservoir pressure of 1502 PSIG was extremely close to the pressure measured 25 years earlier, in 1953, of 1504 PSIG, indicating no measurable pressure depletion. ---**

The San Juan 32-7 Unit No. 6 well is one of the oldest continuously producing coalbed gas wells in the USA, if not the world. It was completed long before the significance of this unique reservoir had been realized. It lies just south of the synclinal axis of the San Juan Basin and appears not to exhibit any structural enhancement. The well has never been stimulated, nor has it required any appreciable maintenance. No significant water production has ever been reported. The production rate has remained essentially constant since 1953. Of the most significance is the fact that this well demonstrates that coalbed gas, under conditions of favorable geology and reservoir characteristics, can be produced economically for a period of at least 30-40 years.

A 51% attack represents the situation where more than half of the computing power within a given blockchain of one person or one concentrated group. This ensures that this group gains full control over this blockchain. For example, they can stop all mining, stop all transactions or spend every coin of this specific blockchain infinitely often.

* **Address**

A cryptocoin address is the location where you store your crypto coins and from where you send and receive your coins. You could compare it with your home address. This address usually consists of a whole row of numbers and digits, which looks something like this: 1KXghhUZRVFmfk9Jreo3vvuV3HDoCJyYJZ. This address is the public part of the two encrypted keys (see private and public key) that are required for the holder to verify a transaction.

* **Airdrop**

This is a kind of giveaway for founders who determine a particular cryptocurrency, giving those coins or coins away. The promotion is for a short period. This is done to publicize the tokens and distribute the tokens.

* **Altcoin**

This name is used for all crypto coins that are not Bitcoin (alternative coins).

* **Altseason**

This is the term given when money flows to altcoins faster than Bitcoin. In other words, when investors buy more altcoins than Bitcoin.

* **Arbitrage**

Buying and selling the same asset on two exchanges to take advantage of small price differences.

* **ASIC mining / miner**

ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit. This is, in fact, a chip that is specially designed to perform one specific task. For this reason, thanks to ASIC mining, you can mine coins a lot faster than a regular computer or laptop could. For example, for Bitcoin, there are special ASIC miners who are only concerned with solving the SHA-256 algorithm. There are also crypto coins that are impossible to mine with an ASIC.

* **ATH**

ATH means All Time High. This is the highest price a cryptocurrency has ever achieved.

* **Bag**

A bag in the crypto world refers to the coins and tokens that you hold as part of your wallet. Typically, the term is used to describe a significant portion of a particular cryptocurrency. For example, a 'moon bag' is filled with the coins you currently own that you think will make you rich.

* **Bear market**

A bear knocks everything down with its claws. That is why a market where the trend is in a downward movement is called a bear market. Sentiment is then negative and prices predominantly fall.

* **Blockchain**

A blockchain is a kind of digital ledger of transactions that works from a decentralized network. Thanks to cryptography, a ledger can be kept by a large number of computers that together create the network. Every time a new transaction is made, it is added by the miners with date, size, etc. to the blockchain as a new block.

* **Block**

The blocks are the ""pages"" in the digital ledger of the blockchain. These are files with immutable data that are permanently stored on the blockchain.

* **Block reward**

The block reward is the reward that miners receive for finding a mathematical solution related to that block. With Bitcoin, this reward is 25 Bitcoins per mined block. This halves every 210,000 blocks.

* **BTFD**

Buy the f \* cking dip! This term is used when the price of a cryptocurrency or the market is in a dip. People are inclined to leave because they are afraid of losing. But a dip offers opportunities to buy a coin or token cheaply before it starts to rise again.

* **Buy the Dip**

Same as BTFD only without the expletives.

* **Bull market**

A bull stabs its horns and throws you up. That is why a Bull Market is a market where the trend is in an upward movement. Prices are rising and sentiment is positive.

* **Cold storage**

Cryptocurrency is stored ‚Äúoffline‚Äù. You do this if you want to safely store coins for a longer period of time. A hardware wallet is an example of cold storage.

* **Cryptography**

Also called secret writing. This focuses on techniques for hiding or encrypting information to be sent so that it is impossible for anyone accessing the channel on which it is sent to find out what information was sent.

* **Cryptocurrency**

A kind of digital currency based on cryptography. This concerns both Bitcoin and other altcoins.

* **DAO**

A DAO is a ""decentralized autonomous organization"" and can be described as an open source blockchain protocol governed by a set of rules, created by its elected members, that automatically perform certain actions without the intervention of intermediaries.

* **dApps**

These are decentralized applications (dApps) are digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or P2P network of computers rather than a single computer, and are beyond the reach and control of a single authority.

* **DeFi - Decentralized Finance**

DeFi, or decentralized financing, is a new way to conduct financial transactions through applications. It excludes traditional financial institutions and intermediaries and is run through the blockchain. Think of it as removing brokers, exchanges, banks and other middlemen from the equation.

* **DEX**

A DEX is a Decentralized Exchange or a decentralized exchange. Decentralized exchanges are a type of cryptocurrency exchange that allows direct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions to take place online securely and without an intermediary. No identification is required at these exchanges.

* **Distributed &amp; Central Ledger**

A distributed ledger is an agreement of shareable, shared, and synchronized data, which in this case is spread across several networks. These networks are then distributed over many computers.

With a central ledger, the synchronized and shareable data is controlled by one network or individual.

* **Double Spending**

This means that a particular cryptocoin can be spent more than once. This stops the blockchain from working.

* **Dust Transaction**

A transaction of extremely few coins that represents almost no value, but takes up space on the blockchain.

* **ECDSA**

Elliptic Curve Digitial Signature Algorithm is a lightweight cryptographic algorithm used to sign transactions on the Bitcoin protocol.

* **ERC20 token**

An ERC20 token is in some ways comparable to Bitcoin, Litecoin and any other cryptocurrency; these tokens are assets based on blockchain technology. They have value and you can send and receive them. ERC20 tokens are only issued on the Ethereum network.

* **Escrow**

A concept in which financial assets are held by a third party to protect them during an asynchronous transaction.

* **Fiat money**

Currencies that were once backed by gold (golden standard). Currently it only has value because people value it.

* **FOMO**

""Fear Of Missing Out"". This often occurs when a cryptocurrency increases in value so quickly that people are afraid that they will miss the boat to riches, causing the price per coin to be even higher.

* **FUD**

""Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt"". This crypto term is often used to describe the volatility of the crypto market.

* **Fork (branch / split)**

A fork happens when an alternate operational version of the current blockchain separates permanently. This can be done in three different ways:

* By a 51% attack
* Because there is a bug in the program
* Because new substantial changes have to be made to the current blockchain.  

* **Genesis block**

The block mined first in a blockchain

* **Halving**

This means that the minable reward (see block reward) is halved. This happens every time with a certain amount of mined blocks. With Bitcoin, for example, this is for every 210,000 blocks.

* **Hash**

A mathematical process that takes a variable number of data as input and produces a shorter result of a fixed length.

* **Hashrate**

This is the speed at which the math problems for certain blocks can be solved. In other words, the speed at which a new block can be discovered. ASIC mining, for example, causes the hash rate to go down.

* **HODL**

Originally 'Hold' was meant, but in a tipsy mood a chat participant kept talking about how he was 'hodling' his coins. This quickly became a meme and now it has become established in the crypto world and means holding onto your crypto coins for the long term. Sometimes it also refers to 'Hold on for dear life'.

* **ICO**

Stands for Initial Coin Offering. This is a form of crowdfunding, where the public can invest in a blockchain startup in advance. As a thank you for the financial support they are rewarded with a certain amount of coins.

* **IEO**

This is an Initial exchange offer. It is a variant of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), managed directly by cryptocurrency exchanges.

* **KYC**

This stands for 'Know Your Customer'. It refers to the verification process that customers must go through to verify their identity and associate it with a cryptocurrency wallet. Crypto exchanges gain a better understanding of the potential client's activities and can determine whether or not they are legal in nature. A legal requirement for many central exchanges (CEX) to admit customers to their fair.

* **Mining**

Mining is the crypto term used to search for new block rewards. For finding and solving blocks, a reward is given to the miner.

* **Moon**

When a cryptocurrency ""goes to the moon,"" it means people think its price will rise exponentially.

* **Multisig (multiple signatures)**

Multisignature is a form of technology that ensures that extra security is added to Bitcoin transactions. Multisiganature addresses require another user to sign the transaction before it can be added to the blockchain.

* **NFT**

An NFT is a Non-fungible Token. They are unique and cannot be exchanged. They live on the blockchain.

* **Node**

A node is a computer connected to the crypto network that uses a client tasked with validating and tracing transactions. Each node receives a copy of the current blockchain, which is automatically downloaded when it joins the Bitcoin network.

* **P2P**

This stands for peer-to-peer. A (crypto) term that refers to computers that directly build a network with each other without a central server in between.

* **Privacy coin**

These are a class of cryptocurrencies that enable private and anonymous blockchain transactions by obscuring their origin and destination. Some of the techniques used include hiding a user's real wallet balance and address, and combining multiple transactions to circumvent chain analysis. Examples are Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC).

* **Private key**

A string of letters and numbers that is kept secret by the user. It is specially designed to sign a digital transfer using a public key. In the case of Bitcoin, this is a private key that must work with a public key.

* **Public key**

A string of letters and numbers that is public and can be viewed by anyone. This can be used in combination with a private key to sign a digital transaction.

* **Pump and Dump**

This is a crypto term used for the unethical process of pumping and dumping a relatively cheap coin. The coin is first obtained in a very cheap way by a certain group of persons who then ""pump"" the coin (make its value rise sharply) by advertising it a lot. When the coin has appreciated enough, they dump their coins with a lot of profit, leaving a large group at a loss.

* **PoW**

Stands for Proof-of-Work. This is a system that links computing power with mining capacity. The more powerful your computer can mine, the more you will be rewarded for this.

* **PoS**

Stands for Proof-of-Stake. This is a system that links the interest in a particular crypto coin to the mining capacity. This means that the more tokens you own of a particular crypto coin, the more you can mine this coin.

The PoW and the PoS are both consensus algorithms. With this mechanism you can organize as a user, but also machines, in a distributed environment. All agents, the nodes of a blockchain, must agree on a single source of truth. Even if some of the nodes fail. This means that the system must be fault tolerant.

* **DPos**

Stands for Delegated Proof-of-Stake. This is a variant of Proof of Stake that uses supernodes or masternodes to approve transactions.

* **Scam coin**

A coin created for the sole purpose of making the creator of this coin rich (usually through pump and dump).

Often this is accompanied by a Pyramid scheme. A pyramid scheme is a business model that recruits members through a promise of payments or services to enroll others in the scheme, rather than providing investment or selling products.

* **SHA-256**

The cryptographic algorithm used for Bitcoin's PoW system.

* **Signature**

A signature is a mathematical process by which someone can prove that he / she is the owner of his / her wallet. For example, a ""private key"" is used.

* **Smart Contract**

A two-way smart contract is an immutable agreement that is recorded on the blockchain, containing specific logical actions that are comparable to a ""normal"" contract. Once this contract has been signed, it can never be changed again. A smart contract can be used to set certain benchmarks that must be met in exchange for money.

* **Wallet**

See ""address""

* **Whale**

A whale is someone or a company that owns a large percentage of a particular crypto coin. It is often the case that a whale can also manipulate the price of this crypto coin.

* **Whitepaper**

A document that describes in detail the protocol of the crypto currency.

* **Yield Farming**

Yield farming, this is also known as liquidity mining. This allows you to generate a way for rewards with cryptocurrency holdings. In simple terms, this means locking cryptocurrencies and receiving rewards. This happens on DeFi projects."

I had a 78.9% but instead of a C+ it was the lowest C- because the test score averages were insanely high. When the class wasn't online the average grades were very low and the curve would raise them so it is suspicious. I believe this encourages academic dishonesty. How do I report this to my university?

I've made some slight edits / updates as well. And now, without further ado...

&amp;#x200B;

So you've been combating FUD, HODLing/buying during 30-60% dips, and reading DD nonstop cuz you like the stock. Congratz, you have been doing well on the front lines and you've been surviving. But this is actually just the easy part. The hardest part is actually knowing when/how to sell and actually turning those shares into tendies, because obviously it doesn't matter how much we hold if we mess up during the squeeze and fail to capture most of the value of the shares. And that's why we're going to add a wrinkle on your ape brain today and discuss about your EXIT STRATEGY.

&amp;#x200B;

\# What is an EXIT STRATEGY, and why is it important?

&amp;#x200B;

 An EXIT STRATEGY is your plan for how and when to sell your shares. This is arguably the most important part of trading, as this is the step that determines how much money you're actually getting. Obviously we're not going to rely on just emotions, or luck, or just YOLO / 360noscoping the sell button arbitrarily during the squeeze, but we're gonna use our wrinkles to get a better educated guess as to when we're going to sell our shares. Not knowing how to sell our shares well will not only give you as an individual less profit, but also might hinder the squeeze and rob the rocket of rocket fuel, meaning the squeeze won't be as high as it could have been, and meaning ALL APES will have less profit. So read, learn, grow a wrinkle or two, and don't fuck it up for the rest of us!

&amp;#x200B;

Some new/repeated points that needs to be reiterated or may not have been covered above:

&amp;#x200B;

\- GME holders don't want to sell on the way up, but they'd \*\*want to start selling after the peak on the way down\*\*, to potentially minimize the regret of selling at $10k but seeing the stock hitting $10 mil, $20 mil, and beyond. Plus selling on the way down ensures the stock can reach it's max price.

&amp;#x200B;

\- \*\*We don't need to worry much about paper hands selling early\*\* at like $5k or $10k because they make up only a small part of retail investors, and because of the short interest is estimated to be anywhere from 200% - 300% all the way to over 500%, it means our wallstreet bagholder shorters will need to buy these shares back multiple times to cover their position, so even if they buy all the paper hand shares, they'll need to do it again multiples of times to even start to cover. They'll buy multiple times to first cancel out the naked shorted positions, then lastly buy a final round to actually cover the legit short positions they have. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- The short squeeze isn't going to last for 2 minutes and that's it. From previous short squeezes, \*\*the build up to the top will last for days, so you'll have PLENTY of time to see it coming\*\*. And even at the very top, the price will bounce around a bit before heading down again to earth, so you'll have plenty of time to sell (by plenty of time I mean more than a few minutes, how much time actually I don't know)

&amp;#x200B;

\- \*\*When you sell, sell with a limit order, not a market order\*\*, because you don't want some freak accident or some illegal shinnanigans where the stock price is worth $10 mil but because you did a market order sell, you somehow got only $50k for your share. From more reading, the bid/ask spread of GME during the squeeze could be stupidly wide, ie bid prices of $10k vs ask prices of $10 mil, so if you sell a market order you'll hit the bid price of $10k. Another situation is your broker routing your orders through market makers like Citadel, and who knows what could happen once they receive your orders. From the DDs it's possible your order won't even make it to the market, and they'll get swallowed up by Citadel instead and you just get back pennies of what your shares should be worth. 

If your broker doesn't allow you to do limit sells, it's okay you can do market order sell, but expect there to be a difference (usually small buy sometimes bigger during times of high volatility) between the market price you see reported on your brokerage platform vs the actual price you sell it at. The problem with limit order selling is that you have to manually view the price all the the time, waiting for the price to hit whatever level you were planning to sell at. Warning, in times of EXTREME volatility, if you set your limit too close to the current price, there is a chance it won't execute. For example, if the stock is dropping from $1 mil, and you go and spend a minute to set up a limit set order at $990k, by the time you finish clicking and typing, the price could already be at $989k by the time you submit the order, and your order won't fill. Best to have looser sell limit of like maybe 5-10% below current price, or even more, during times of extreme volatility. If you want to, you can also set a trailing stop limit order, which is something that limits how much you can lose but doesn't cap the gain. The issue with setting a trailing stop limit order is that if you don't set it properly, ie, not giving yourself enough room, then potentially any volatile spikes downwards on the rocket ride up could accidentally trigger those stop loss limits and make you sell prematurely, kicking you off the rocket before it arrives at andromeda. For example, in the $DRYS example in the linked DD, if you set your trailing stop loss to be 10%, then you would have gotten kicked off the rocket at only a little past half way. If you just use a plain old limit order sell, then that gives you the most control. I guess you could also set a trailing stop limit order sell at 10% below current price once the price goes past your target price.For more info: \[[https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-15#:\\\~:text=A%20trailing%20stop%20order%20is,is%20not%20a%20specific%20price.&amp;text=However%2C%20if%20the%20security's%20price,reaches%20the%20trailing%20stop%20price\](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-15#:\~:text=A%20trailing%20stop%20order%20is,is%20not%20a%20specific%20price.&amp;text=However%2C%20if%20the%20security's%20price,reaches%20the%20trailing%20stop%20price](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-15#:\~:text=A%20trailing%20stop%20order%20is,is%20not%20a%20specific%20price.&amp;text=However%2C%20if%20the%20security's%20price,reaches%20the%20trailing%20stop%20price](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-15#:~:text=A%20trailing%20stop%20order%20is,is%20not%20a%20specific%20price.&amp;text=However%2C%20if%20the%20security's%20price,reaches%20the%20trailing%20stop%20price)).

EDIT: Some have told me they can't set limit sell orders below current market price. If that's the case maybe it's better to set a stop loss sell order so when the price hits that stop price, the order will fill. Problem with that is your order won't execute right away if the price remains higher than your stop price. Or just do a market sell order and hope the actual sell price is close to the reported sell price when you submit the order. Each brokerage behaves a little differently so it's best to get to know the ins and outs of your own particular brokerage. 

Another method if you really have market sell orders only available for your broker is to sell 1 single share at a time. If nothing shady happens, then you can keep on proceeding to sell your shares a couple at a time with your market order. But if you sell a share and you get back like $10k instead of $10 mil, then obviously you'd want to hold off of selling the rest of your shares and figure out how you can sell using alternative options (maybe changing the routing? Ask your broker)

&amp;#x200B;

\- \*\*Don't panic when the price halts\*\*. It's supposed to halt when there is a drastic change in price, either up or down. Because of these price halts, you'll have even more time to react when the price sky rockets.\[[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradinghalt.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradinghalt.asp)\]([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradinghalt.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradinghalt.asp))\[[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/circuitbreaker.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/circuitbreaker.asp)\]([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/circuitbreaker.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/circuitbreaker.asp))

Just halts alone on the way to the peak is gonna take up hours of trading time.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Make sure your brokerage actually allows you to sell your shares at your price target. I've heard some brokerages have a limit on how big your order can be or maybe have limits to your account itself. Example, if the brokerage has a limit on transactions being less than a mil, then you'd be screwed if you're trying to sell GME for more than a mil. Also, it's a bit different than being allowed to set limit prices at like a mil while the current price is still $200. Even for the broker I use, they said there is a limit to what price you can set a limit sell order at, and that limit changes depending on the stock price. So if GME rockets, so should the limit sell price cap.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Watch the volume as well. It's expected the volume to increase signicantly during the squeeze, probably being at it's max around half way into the squeeze, and tapering off towards the top of the squeeze. Conversely, the sell volume will be almost non-existant in the middle of the squeeze, and will increase gradually as we get to the top and then down on the other side back to earth.\[[https://www.thebalance.com/buying-and-selling-volume-1031027#:\\\~:text=Total%20volume%20is%20made%20up,were%20associated%20with%20selling%20trades](https://www.thebalance.com/buying-and-selling-volume-1031027#:\~:text=Total%20volume%20is%20made%20up,were%20associated%20with%20selling%20trades)\]([https://www.thebalance.com/buying-and-selling-volume-1031027#:\~:text=Total%20volume%20is%20made%20up,were%20associated%20with%20selling%20trades](https://www.thebalance.com/buying-and-selling-volume-1031027#:~:text=Total%20volume%20is%20made%20up,were%20associated%20with%20selling%20trades)).

\- [While OBV (On-Balance Volume)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/onbalancevolume.asp) is good for seeing a bigger picture of the general trend of a stock (ie: GME OBV = we're HODLing very well), the way it's calculated is looking at day to day volumes. Meaning it'll still be good for monitoring the squeeze process over the course of a week or two (not sure how long it'll really last), but OBV is pretty much useless if you want to see intra-day activity. Correct me if I'm wrong. For intra-day momentum indicators, MACD and Stoch RSI is still your best friend. Although ,they are known as [lagging indicators](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laggingindicator.asp#:~:text=A%20lagging%20indicator%20is%20an,trends%20and%20changes%20in%20trends), so they won't be able to exactly capture changes in momentum in real time. 

\- Also, make sure you have access to multiple ways to access your account to sell. IE: Don't rely on your ghetto phone at like 3% battery left on the day of the squeeze to sell on your app. Have multiple devices ready, phones, laptops, desktops, all set up to log in quick and to issue sell orders at a moment's notice, all fully charged. 

\*\*- lastly, the peak will not be whatever number you want it to be, or whatever number we all want it to be. It could, or it could not. The peak will simply be the peak. Don't just blindly hold to a certain number thinking that it's gonna be the peak. You must always check all the indicators as the squeeze is happening and monitor carefully so you don't miss the peak. All the prices we've been asking for are theoretical. None of us are prophets. Do your own due diligence during the squeeze, don't rely on others.\*\* 

\- Have multiple ways of monitoring GME price movements / doing TA on GME. I'm just paranoid that during MOASS the powers to be will shut down Yahoo Finance, Trading View, Think or Swim, etc, so that we're trading blind. You'll need multiple backup methods of monitoring stock price + momentum indicators. If anyone has a list, then by all means let's brainstorm and get a list going. Personally my broker also offers this service so if worse comes to worse I'll just use my broker's ghetto UI chart for GME.

‚≠êEXIT STRATEGY EXAMPLE‚≠êI'm sitting here masturbating and suddenly the price jumps from trading sideways at $200-$300 to $400. I know something's up. So I now actually stay paying attention to the price. The price goes up past $1k. Okay, maybe it's a gamma squeeze, and it's transitioning to a short squeeze. There has been a LOT of halts along the way, but it's fine, because as the price is rising, in my head I'm thinking that the share will go past $100k minimum, so if there are slight dips along the way I don't panic. After several hours, the price has hit $5k and the trading day ends. My portfolio is now sitting at over a mil of unrealized gains. Now I'm fighting myself. Should I sell? I mean, a mil is a lot, more money than I've ever seen in my life. A mil can make my parents retire not too shabbily either. Or, should I wait until tomorrow? Everyone will have inner struggles at this point with their inner paper hand demons. But at this point I take a look at the overall volume. Multiple times higher than pre-squeeze, but is it enough for all the shorts to have covered? If not, then why sell? Shorts still are buying to cover. What are the MACD and RSI saying? I'd wait until the next day. Next day, a bit of a sell off due to paper hands. Expected. After a 15% dip, the buying continues and stutters and gaps it's way up to $20k, and the trading day ends again. Same thing, now I think to myself, damn I have over $5 mil I can just pocket immediately. Probably don't have to work for the rest of my life if I'm careful of spending. Should I sell? This is a personal question, only you, fellow ape, can answer. But I'm holding to bankrupt the DTCC so I'm not selling at this point. Rinse and repeat until the price gets REALLY interesting.

I am also keeping an eye on technical analysis indicators in the above linked DDs to try and guess where the top is. Let's say the price has reached $1 mil, and it paused there, and the indicators are starting to point to a reversal. Whether $1 mil is the top or not, we don't know, but we can still wait  to see if it breaks out and rockets up further. At that point I could:

1. Put in a 10% trailing stop limit sell order on my 10% of my shares at $1 mil. If it goes up, then I will still on the ride to the top. But if it goes down 10%, then it'll fill my sell order. At that point, I have 90% of my shares left. I can set another stop limit sell order with 10% of my shares at 10% below the new current price. If the share goes back up past a mil on it's way to the peak (which I still don't know what it is), then I'm still on the rocket with 90% of my shares left. If the stock continues to go down and my 2nd order is filled, then I'm going to rethink how much I plan to sell next. And I don't think at that point near the top there would be any more volatile movements of 10% or more, but this is pure speculation. One thing for certain is I'm not going to fire all my bullets at a single shot and sell everything. Chances are you've failed to pinpoint the exact peak, and the real peak is at a different price point. Selling in smaller chunks lets you have more chances of actually reaching the peak instead of blowing your load at like 20% on the way up. 

&amp;#x200B;

PS: Before you all accuse me of anchoring the price at a mil, $1 mil per share is just an arbitrary price point I picked to illustrate an example. Could be 100x higher , could be lower, no one knows. I don't know how high it'll moon, that's why this post exists in the first place, so you do the DD and know the technicals so you can guesstimate where the top is when it happens. The numberes can change, but the strategy won't. $1 mil is just an easy number to type.

\# Warning, the ULTIMATE FUD is coming, and the ONLY way to combat it is to have a solid exit strategy NOW.

&amp;#x200B;

With the way things are going on our sub, I almost can guarantee when the squeeze starts and when the price hits $1000 or higher, we're gonna be FLOODED with fake DD's saying that it's the peak and here's why, with lots of technical charts and crayons and lines and fancy trading language and other bullshit to try and trick people into selling. If you don't sufficiently do your DD now and understand why $1000 will NOT be the peak, then I can guarantee you you're gonna paper hand and sell at $1000. Knowledge is power, and HFs know that. That's why posts like this gets downvoted to oblivion as soon as it comes out. EDUCATE yourself, form your exit strategy NOW, and stick to it through thick and thin, through the FUD FLOOD armageddon that will come.

&amp;#x200B;

Adding to this, as mentioned by another user, while r/superstonk bans gain p0rn until the whole thing is over, r/wallstreetbets and other subreddits will not, so you're going to see a whole flood of people posting gain p0rn after selling at $1k or $2k, and buying various articles of luxury maybe, like lambos. You have to prepare yourself now for that day when reddit front page is just all GME gain p0rn. Are you also gonna FOMO and paper hand it before GME truly reaches the stars, because the shill tactics then is making it look like everyone else is selling,and you're afraid of being a ""bag holder""? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: Some are saying not to sell on the way down because there is no more demand and you'll be caught holding the bag, thus you should only sell on the way up. This is only correct if you assume that the very last few shares hedgies need to buy, the last shares out of all 300%+ of outstanding shares, is bought at the very peak, and after that, demand drops to exactly 0% and there is not a single person buying anymore after the peak. But is that a realistic assumption? Up to you to decide. My thinking is that there will be sellers who sell on the way up, and there will be buyers as well on the way up. But some people will wait until the peak and sell on the way down, just like there may be buyers who wait until after the peak and buy on the way down. I personally don't believe there is a hard cut off at the peak where the buy volume suddenly drops to 0. The amount of buyers and sellers at each price point during the squeeze should follow a gaussian distribution curve, imho. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Why is decentralising important? Because users like you and me can now take control of the money we use, instead of relying on banks and intermediaries. They are taking a lot of mark up in this process!
* What ""power"" does DeFi bring? It gives people the ability to create and move money across the world at any given time
* What's the difference between DeFi and bitcoin? Bitcoin is money. It's programmable money. DeFi is the operating system of money. So bitcoin is like Facebook app. And DeFi is the iOS that your iPhone runs on.

**What is DeFi**

DeFi means decentralised finance. 10 years ago, we saw the creation of Bitcoin ‚Äî a decentralised money. Building upon this asset (decentralised money), we are now at the stage of decentralised finance.

**Give Me An Example**

If Adam has $100 and Ron needs to borrow $100, how does that work? If you trust each other, you can just lend directly, and maybe Adam charges an interest rate, let's say 5%.

In the traditional finance space today, you don't know each other. So Adam put the money with the bank. The bank pays Adam some interest. Then the bank uses that money to find people like Ron, who wants to borrow. And Ron pays the interest to the bank.

DeFi now replaces the role of the bank. And solves the problem of ""trust"" across the world. Instead of trusting the people, DeFi turns that trust into code in the system. How? (1) money (aka Facebook app) is programmable. And (2) the operating system of money (aka your iOS or Android system) is also programmable.

Now, Adam can find all the Rons in the world without having to

* Trust Ron or know Ron personally
* Engage with a bank or third party that will take profits away
* Find a centralised institution

**Tell Me More about this ""Programmable Money System"" thing**

We are basically programming code into the money (e.g. $Dai). And in the code, we incentivise people to put money in or take money out.

How? We do this by changing interest rates.

This will change people's behaviours by creating loans and to encourage lending or borrowing.

When demand drops, the interest rate drops. People are more likely to demand more $Dai now, since it is cheaper.

When demand goes up, there is too much supply. Interest rates increase. People demand less $Dai because it's more expensive now.

The change in interest rate is executed by programs and code!

**What's so cool about it though?**

Well, you can use this programmable money ($Dai) to lend it out. Someone can borrow it and use it as collateral to do something else instead. Maybe like to stake the $Dai in a Curve vault and gain both interest and $CRV governance token while also earning $YFI tokens.

The entire system is a huge lego building block to stake on top of each other. That's where the fun begins!"

I have just finished my junior year at a Non-target state school in the Northeast.  My major is finance and my gpa is currently a 3.5.  As of now I have no internship for this summer after about 50(and counting) applications and only 2 interviews.  I am worried about my chances of landing a job after finishing school because of the lack of experience I have in the field.  I‚Äôm interested in a wide variety of positions becuase I honestly do not know much about the daily duties of people working in financial analysis and corporate finance.  The best things I have going for me on my resume is my treasurer position in the business fraternity along with my BMC certification from this past semester.  I have also been accepted to the school‚Äôs competitive student lead investment fund but have not listed that as threads on here advise against listing future positions.  Looking at this summer with no internship I have decided to leave my current job at a healthcare company to deliver for Amazon making about $7/hr more. Is this a bad move professionally? I was lucky enough to retain my role per diem so I am not officially quitting.

My questions are:
What can I do to be a better candidate in the future?

Is it time to be worrying about landing a career after graduation?

How have you found success in networking?

Also, if anybody was looking to be a mentor or even just has extra time for advice I would really appreciate it.  I feel really behind the curve for someone entering senior year.

Thank you."

San Diego State Review

The truth about San Diego State, and the university system, from a  college graduate. 

I wrote this the way it needs to be written, not politically correct and real. As a result, there might be things the administration may not like, but I really don‚Äôt care, as this is my experience. The whole university system needs to be destroyed, as it is a big self-regulating, shakedown business that is politically motivated, and less an educational institution.

As it relates to academics, I can only speak about the business department, but the academics are rigged against the students. There is an internal war within the finance department. In more detail, some professors want certain classes to be taught one way while, some of them want it to be taught another way. Some professors are more honest about this than others. The university does this to improve their ranking among the nation. This is unacceptable.

To prove credibility, I have talked to numerous professors during office hours and the subject would come up. I would ask their opinion on the issue, they would say,‚Äù Aaron, I tend to agree with you.‚Äù In other conversations with different professors, the same subject came up and the professor said,‚Äù the school does it to protect their ranking.‚Äù No, names will not be given. 

The university is under pressure to make the academics as hard as possible. The reason for this is so the universities ranking climbs. To be more specific, most people will get letter grades of C‚Äôs and D‚Äôs on most tests. The university has a GPA range of 2.2-2.9 to which they can curve. I can tell you from off the record conversations with professors, the administration does not want anyone to get above a 2.3, as they have come down on professors with a curve of a minimal 2.4. Moreover, even if a professor is in the correct range, say a 2.9, again, they will come down on them because it does not fit the school‚Äôs agenda of protecting their ranking. 

To give more detail, most will hardly pass, with an average of a ‚ÄúC‚Äù, this will be stated on most syllabuses, with wording to the effect of, ‚ÄúC‚Äù, the most common undergraduate grade. Statistically, for the most common undergraduate grade in every single class to be a ‚ÄúC‚Äù is so low, it would never happen without it being rigged of some sort. The days of getting mostly good grades is over (in general). Students are subjected to extremely hard tests, to where the average will be so low, the university has to curve to make the average come up to where students pass, but barely. 

Another thing that should be brought to your attention, like every other university, San Diego State is a big business that is politically motivated. As like most universities, SDSU leans left, politically. You will notice in textbooks, PowerPoints, lectures, and emails from the administration, most things are liberal and one-sided. To give you a few examples, anytime there is something politically going on in the country, the administration feels it must interject their opinion, which is not center, but with a liberal bias. This is an educational institution, not a liberal indoctrination camp. They go after our president every chance they get, yet are dead silent as it relates to the destruction and rhetoric the BLM poses, such as them wanting to kill cops. SDSU has its own police department, therefore the administration should be ashamed of themselves for picking and choosing as it relates to political matters. In other words, fuck off. 

Another example, in relation to politics in academics, is the Business Department. The department requires a global business course, all of which addresses the liberal issue of globalization, the subject that kills the American worker and GDP, but they do not tell you that. In BA 405, you will revisit globalization with a one-sided text and PowerPoint. Taking such classes is fine, what is not fine is not talking about and learning about the other side, so people can make up their mind on what is best. Instead, students are told what to think, not how to think. I was never shy to speak my mind, as a result was never too popular.  **Update: The anti-Trump course proves my point.** 

The university is involved in the practice of extortion. In more detail, students will be forced to pay an extra $55 fee to graduate, through coercion. This a shakedown. The administration will tell you it is to ‚Äúevaluate your degree‚Äù to make sure you have completed all classes required. Anyone can do that on WebPortal for free and will take no three minutes, and if there are still questions, advisors will help you. In other words, it is just to gouge students one last time before they leave, again college is a big business. 

The Bookstore: textbook prices have increased by 812% since 1978, rising faster than health care, home prices, and inflation itself. This is no accident. The university most likely is involved in some sort of kickback scheme, in relation to the publishers. Every single year the university pushes the new addition on its students, with little to no new material added, except the chapters being in a different order. 

Another example how universities are revolved around the shakedown business is the WPA. Each student in the CSU system during their junior year must pay $45 to take the test, after completing all required placement courses when first entering college- including reading and writing. Students have no choice, as this is coercion.

The WPA is a predetermined setup by the administration for failure. The exam standards are based on graduate standards; therefore, the corrupt administration knows undergraduate juniors will not perform at the proper level, thus failing the exam- it is a ruse and they know it. 

One can get all A‚Äôs on their papers throughout their college career, but still must enroll in an extra writing course because of the scoring of the WPA, which can be put off till the students last semester. In more detail, a score of a 9 is failing, so is an 8, which accounts for 80% of scores. Outside of the exam standards, a score of a 9 is an A; excellent, and 8 translate to a B; praiseworthy performance. In order not to take an extra writing course, one must score a perfect 10/10- very unlikely as only 12% of students pass with such score.

The CSU system needs to abolish the WPA exam, as it is illogical, other than the fact of concentration of the financial bottom line. To elaborate, a student can successfully complete the writing requirement by getting a course grade that is less than the score the student got on the writing exam. This alone, makes the WPA argument invalid, laughable, and thus profit driven. 

The dollar amount associate with this scam is, as anyone would imagine; huge. The average graduating class over the last two years has been roughly 10,000 students. If a person multiplies the last year class number by $45, it is equal to $450,000. San Diego State has roughly 35,000 students in total. If a person multiplies the total SDUS population by $45, it is equal to $ 1,575,000. The numbers found are just for taking the mandatory exam, these figures do not account for the extra writing course, on average, most of the students must enroll in after failing the exam with a score of a B or an A. 

It is not my job, nor the students to support the corrupt university and employees based on crooked profit motivations and predetermined failures. With the argument presented, the unethical administration could eradicate the WPA. However, the people who pull strings could make the writing class mandatory by repackaging it as an undergraduate prerequisite, thus gaining an extra 12% of profit from the students who would have passed the exam. If came to fruition, this would result in there being absolutely no reason at all for those to take a course, as that 12% of students‚Äô analyzation skills are at graduate level, again, over and above where they should be according to undergraduate standards, thus the course has no merit.

**SDSU Finance Course Review:**

**BA300:** This class is one of those classes, (like most classes), where the idea behind it is pure profit. This class is absolutely meaningless and useless, and thus a waste of time. Ethical decision making comes down to two things; whether one is a good person or not- Plain and simple. It is naive to think anyone is going to use whatever they taught you in this course to go about making an ethical choice or not in the business field**. It‚Äôs also laughable to think a crooked organization has the balls to teach anything about ethics.** 

**BA310:** This class has one main idea; liberal indoctrination. It is this type of course that results in the majority of my generation being so far left, out-of-touch with reality, and borderline communist, that they do not have the ability to think for themselves. In more detail, teaching and advocating globalism; the idea that has arguably killed the American economy the last 30 years, and not even acknowledging the other side, national economics, is unacceptable.  The thing I took away from this course and learned from the education system is, tell students what to think, not how to think. 

**BA323:** I was surprised when I took this course, why one might ask? Because I found it valuable. I took this with Stephen Blum. I understand some people in the finance department do not like this guy, however, I liked his style of teaching; practicality. In more detail, we did not focus learning bullshit formulas that have zero real-world value, but instead focuses our learning on practical application via financial calculator. It is na√Øve to think that any American with a finance job would apply these formulas or let alone know how to use them when they have software and calculator that can do it for them.  In short, Blum wants students to succeed, and doesn‚Äôt succumb to the rigged grading policy of the university where the majority will receive a C.  That is the reason why the finance department does not like him. The administration would like to fire him, however nothing can be done as he is a volunteer. It looks like you will have to deal with it. 

**BA350:** This course is like most courses; strategically placed in the course catalog to make the school profit. This course, behavioral management has nothing to do with finance, and everything to do with sociology using business concepts. In other words, pointless information retained for one month at a time to pass a test that is meaningless as it relates to my field, then forgotten. Mr. Sannwald was a very nice guy, but his job (like most professors jobs) would be in danger if I had my way because there is no need for this course of a practical level. 

**BA360:** Much like BA350 and other courses, this course is useless to my major, not practical, and an overall a waste of time as a result of the way it is taught. In more detail, instead of being taught the practical software supply chain employees would use of a daily basis, students are taught insignificant diagram and math formulas ( all of which I forgot) and are told to believe this is valuable when it is not. Again, the only reason it is in the course catalog is the school can make a profit. My professor, Probett, was a very nice lady, did her job well, and wants students to succeed, but the subject being taught is not necessary for finance majors. 

**BA 370:** Marketing. How is this finance related again? Oh yeah, it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs only in the course catalog to make the school money. At this point a pattern is beginning. We are five classes in my review, and only one so far is valuable to my future, I feel like I am being shaken down for thousands of dollars at this point of my college career. As it relates to the actual marketing course, the information goes in one ear and out the other and is retained just enough time to pass a test and move on. 

**BA405:** Strategic management I actually enjoyed. In order to take this course however, students must complete all the courses listed above, and then one or two more before being enrolled. The committees (people that have never taught or taken the same course in most cases) think that makes sense, however it does not. Students can successfully complete BA 405 without prerequisites. Nothing in the course ties all subjects together in any substantial way, the course itself is its own subject, a subject that I enjoyed and found practical. I thought the final project was a great exercise to dissect a business and apply everything learned in the book. In general, I found the book, and class to have significant value to my field- even without being directly finance related. 

**ACCT 325/326:** I decided to combine both accounting courses into one, the main reason being both were absolutely worthless- like most courses. What the hell does accounting have to do with finance? If there is one thing I learned from this place, it is that they are the exact opposite. Finance is future oriented, while accounting is history. From a real world corporate standpoint, a company has a finance department, and an accounting department. Guess what? They are separate. In both courses, students do not learn anything valuable to their field, and the average is a C, just like the way the university likes it (after the curve, which has to be huge, otherwise no one would pass).

**FIN321:** This finance course is driven by the subject of economics. Although not finance related, I found the subject valuable. The application and understanding is meaningful. However, the math, although not difficult, should take a backseat. I understand with economics; the math and application are linked. However, I found the math to be somewhat pointless, and the ideas and application more valuable. In general, I would argue this course should stay in the catalog. 

**FIN325:** This course I found to be a mix of 323 and 327 together. In more detail, and if I remember correctly, the majority of the course was the same teachings of BA 323, then towards the end focused on investment subjects, being FIN 237. This course could be valuable, but it is not. The way it is taught does not focus on real-world value, but instead academic bullshit revolving around written out formulas that have no real-world value, as anyone on wall street or the corporate  world would just use software or a calculator to solve such problems, if such problems actually exist in the corporate world, although I doubt your average finance employee knows anything about WACC or CAPM in an academic way. The bottom line as it relates to FIN 325 is this; the course needs to be abolished. 

**FIN327:** The course of investments I was excited for but was disappointed quickly. Any logical person would think that students taking an investment course would gain an upper hand on the field of investing, learn few tips and tricks in the market, or learn about the different investment companies out there to use, did that happen? No, of course not. All that was learned, then forgotten was hand written formulas that do not mean a single thing, but hey, at least a calculator was allowed.  My professor was not the best teacher either. In more detail, He was lazy and just read off a PowerPoint, with no concepts really being taught. He was a sharp guy outside the classroom who did very well for himself, but inside the classroom he‚Äôs a loser.  

**FIN 329:** This course is very much like BA310; liberal indoctrination. In more detail, I found this class to be more political driven than finance driven, and of course one-sided-to the left.  To take a class on global trade, and have the subject shoved down student‚Äôs throats, but not learn about the other side is pathetic- enough said. 

**FIN 423:** This course is tough. The main thing learned, which was not even finance related, but learning how to work in a group. More specifically, given a task with no starting point and not knowing where to start was the biggest issue learned. Turning nothing into a 45 -minute project was something to be proud of- even if the wrong answer was presented (which happened to my group). In general, although tough, enjoyed the idea of the course, as we are all left to our own devices and did what was necessary to complete the task- much like the corporate world. 

**Post-Graduation:**  Employers value experience over education any day of the week. Everyone from my generation has a degree, thus a person my age cannot standout to an employer anymore, as there is more supply than demand. Wages are down, and employers do not want to hire new college graduates- even though we flood the market.  

The universities inflate attractive starting wages that could be obtained by via enrollment, so they make as much money as possible. Economically this makes no sense, as stated above via supply and demand. Not to mention all one has to do is search for a job and see real wages stated on an average job description isn't even close to one stated by a school.The universities inflate attractive starting wages that could be obtained by via enrollment, so they make as much money as possible.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from a line of Greg Lewis with BTIG. Your line is open.

Greg Lewis

Thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. And, yes, Steve, congrats on moving forward with the beta testings. It seems like it's kind of progressing nice. I did want to dig in a little bit into the additional CapEx. Kind of walking through and looking back at the previous quarter‚Äôs press release, it looks like about a 100 of plus that was related to R&amp;D. Could you kind of walk us through some of those changes? And what is kind of driving that incremental capital requirement on the R&amp;D side?

Steve Burns

Yes. Thanks, Greg. And by the way, just before I jump in, I want to make sure everybody knows we have Darren Post, our Chief Engineer here; and John Vo, our VP of Propulsion, I just want to be able to answer any questions that you're going to you ask. The 50,000 foot view there is, we've had to -- because of supply chain, we've had to bring a lot more stuff in house, right? Hurts you upfront, because you got a tool for that, you got a engineer for that, right? But it helps you in the long run, it definitely helps you as the Endurance volumes go up and as we layer in additional vehicles, like the van.

So, the engineering all -- for example, a lot of people don't realize, all the betas, right, those aren't inventory, those are treated as R&amp;D. So as we marched through everything, some things were a little more expensive than we thought, some things we had to go outside for validation, like the brake testing and things like that. And a lot of it's just how we're going to make these parts inside rather than purchase them. So, that kind of all dovetails into that.

Greg Lewis

Okay, okay, great. Thank you for that. And then just, I just did want to follow-up. I mean, it looks like you're progressing through on making this move forward on the crash test. What else -- what other kind of hurdles should we be looking for over the next couple of months, kind of ahead of moving into pre-production in July?

Steve Burns

Right, great question. So obviously, crash testing is a huge gating item, right? If that doesn't go as you think or if it goes really sideways, that can cost a year and hundreds of hundreds or a billion dollars, right? So that is why there are no small car companies usually in the United States because of that. So, to get pass that gating item, really should lower execution risk for anybody thinking about, are we going to get to September? The other thing is, as we've been making estimates over the last year, as you get closer to production, obviously the number of variables decreases. So, you just start to dial it in more and more. Of course, could supply chain continue to evolve? Yes. But we have taken the liberty of securing the things -- the big things that we can see that we wouldn't be able to pivot. So for example, we have our cells sourced from two different vendors. So, we have enough cells contractually to make it all the way through our foreseeable future. Electronics, the chips shortage you hear about all the time, we went ahead and upfront bought those enough to get through this year, so that we're not constrained that way. Frame, we had to bring the frame in-house because that was at risk with suppliers. So things like that.

But I think in general, what -- this is costing us more than we thought. But relative to the conventional thinking, we're moving very quick and really doing this for a good pricing. So, we're very happy with it. We don't like that it's moving, the target is moving a little bit. But we've taken the attitude of first-to-market is everything. It's really starting to evolve that, a vehicle like this, this size, this bed, this cab, this range, this price point is a very popular item, kind of with the events of last week and what is not just a niche item now, it's really gone mainstream. And so, we think first mover advantage is very important. So we have always sided on the fact that, how do we maintain September.

Darren Post

And Greg, just to drill down on your point about what's left to do. So Darren Post here. A couple of things, we go from beta where we have production intent designs with more prototype parts. But as we go to PPV, we go to production, in 10 parts of production tools. So, that's going to be the big change that happens in the PPV build. As we do that, we'll be continuing deeper into our durability testing, our brake tuning, steering systems and vehicle dynamics work. So, that's a big milestone as we move forward. And then that sets us up for FMVSS 100 series, which are the non-press regulatory tests that we need to do with the PPVs, that will start at the end of the summer.

Steve Burns

So the short answer again, Greg, I think is regulatory is a big part of this business, right? And as you can imagine, it's supply chain and regulatory. Once you get your recipe and your engineering done, and you've got a vehicle that physically is attractive to folks, and also, the specs meet their needs, then it comes down to regulatory and supply chain and your in-house production. So, obviously in house production, we are in pretty much control. But regulatory is a big part of U.S. automotive. We've again passed the biggest gate there is. These two tests that we've passed are the toughest two, and we wanted to get those out front. The fact that the test matches highly correlates as I say to our software emulation, so it basically did exactly what we thought. It's quite remarkable to be at this stage.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.

John Murphy

Just wanted to ask -- a first question, obviously you're commenting that you're going to raise capital sooner, rather than later. And you made mention on the call of an ABL or an asset backed line or other structure. I‚Äôm just curious, what you would put into that, and maybe if you could consider the Lordstown plants, what would the borrowing base beyond that? You've talked about, I mean that being billions of dollars, I think $2 billion plus in replacement value. So that would give you a lot of runway. I mean how do you think about potentially pledging the Lordstown plants? And is that part of the discussion so far? And how big could that be?

Steve Burns

Great question. And obviously, we're looking at all types of capital. But non-dilutive like that is -- that in strategic is very important to us. But we have zero debt. And we have a lot of assets. So it lends itself and we're buying a lot of parts and so all that -- there's folks that want to finance that. So it's -- we‚Äôre pretty mature on some of the discussions. I mean, they're early, but we feel, it's a prudent thing to do. So we're spending time on that. Julio, did you want to say anything about that?

Julio Rodriguez

Yes. And we have $1 billion in assets that we can use for and -- but we want to do capital financing of the new or next capital expenditures that we're going into, so‚Ä¶

Steve Burns

So there's a lot of folks that -- not a lot of folks, there are folks that make a living out of financing CapEx and then it always helps if you got extra collateral above and beyond that.

John Murphy

And then just a second question. Steve, you were mentioning, bringing or in-sourcing some parts, because the supply chain was not necessarily ready or disrupted by COVID. And that's part of the expenses and CapEx went up. I think you said something about in-sourcing the frame. And just curious, when you think you need to make decisions because the frame is a big capital commitment and do an R&amp;D feed on your trucks and any vehicle for that matter that has a frame. What other parts are being in-sourced? And when do you kind of pull the trigger and do that? That seems like a pretty quick turnaround, if you‚Äôve in-sourced the frame, since the last conference call. I just want to understand how this is working?

Steve Burns

Yes. And just for those who don't know, we are body-on-frame vehicle, like all trucks, are most trucks. And so the frame is where our truck gets its rigidity, its strength. We also have the thing that most people don't have to consider when they're engineering is we have a big battery pack in between that [frame]. And just again, a quick note on the frontal crash test, it did not penetrate, didn't touch the battery pack. So those are the kinds of considerations that go into your frame. And the vendor that we had laid out for the frame suddenly was going to be able to -- or was going to have to charge us more and we just decided to take it in-house. It's constantly a -- do we pay more for the part and hard to our profit margin or do we source it inside and sourcing inside of course, like I said, this frame will be very similar to the frame for the van. And we start -- when you're going to be a multi vehicle platform, and you really can get those kind of leverages, it starts to change your decision process and the van is just looking more and more like a winner for us. So we -- that affects it. So I'll let Rich maybe jump in a little bit there.

Rich Schmidt

Yes. So John, like Steve said, we do -- when we store stuff, we do, of course, have multiple suppliers. We had three different suppliers on the frame. Some of it was based on timing, some is based on cost. And a lot of it was based on the timing schedule of the launch of the vehicle. Some of it was based on cost. But once we do the return of investment and the timeline of the launching the Endurance in the fall, it came down to best option for us was to in-source the frame and that give us the flexibility to go to market on multiple vehicles quicker as well. And of course, we have our own stamping plant. And we have a lot of spare robots with the size of facility that we've got from General Motors. So it allowed us to put a lot of those processes in place. And it was the best business decision for us to in-source the frame. So that's the decision we went with as a business.

John Murphy

And Rich, may to follow-up, how fast can you made that decision? I mean, does that mean -- we're talking about a big decision. And if you've got these new presses and the robots, the weld shop to do this, I mean that's pretty impressive and seems like maybe you should have been thinking about, I mean, doing that before if -- I mean if you had all that stuff, that capital, and you how fast those decisions get made?

Rich Schmidt

It took us about -- we didn't really want to make that decision upfront, because of the capital investment, as you said, it was about a three month decision that we really didn't want to have to do in the beginning because we were trying to save the capital. But at the last minute, as Steve said, we had a supplier kind of pull back and then the other supplier -- let's say supplier B and supplier C the price was very drastic to our BOM cost and timeline. So we had to choose to bring it in-house at that point.

Steve Burns

The other decision that went into it is, where we're going to have to change it, why does the crash test just didn‚Äôt go well? We're going to have to change it? If you got an outside vendor making it, they're not as quick to respond. What, it did great in the crash test, but we're just -- it is constantly a buy versus make conversation. Comes down to usually, it's a little more expensive upfront, of course, but pays off in the long run. And as an early OEM, right, we're really cognizant of -- there are some people that sub everything out, right, some small -- some EV start-ups, just say, I'm subbing everything out. And we have a lot of folks here from Tesla, for example, and they know a new OEM, whoever you are, you're going to have early issues. And you want to be able to deal with those quickly, not having a third party taking their time or busy with another client or that sort of thing. So big things like frame, we just started realizing we should have in-house in addition to the economics. It's also being able to -- we want to make sure that any early teething problems that we have as a new OEM, we're in position, right? Our battery packs, we're making the pack. We're making the hub motor. We're making the frame. The biggies are in our control.

John Murphy

And then just lastly real quick. I mean one of the appeals of the business models that you're getting out there in front of potential established competition in, we've heard news about the F-150 lightning. Price point is relatively surprisingly low below $40,000. So I mean as you think about the competitive environment and the potential slowdown in your production ramp, how concerned are you in that putting you sort of on your back foot in the competitive environment? And/or if you raise enough capital, could you reaccelerate the -- your production ramp curve?

Steve Burns

Yes. Everything we're doing is to enable us to -- when we receive the capital, we're looking at to be able to have it all the pent-up system ready to go. I think the competitive landscape is the most important part of our conversation here. We're just -- the fact that a competitor who is very established automaker and has been working on this for several years and didn't come out with a 600-mile truck or a flex capacitor or a wild-looking vehicle, right, front, same bed, same cab, about the same range, about the same pricing. So it's quite remarkable that we are on par with somebody like that at this point, and we're getting the market faster, but we sure are always cognizant of -- there just seems to be such a market demand for us. And now that it's gone mainstream, not just niche, we want to be ready to pounce if the market demand is what we think. So we're always keeping that in mind. It would be crushing to have the lead, have the first market mover and not be able to fulfill -- I mean, obviously, you can't just move on a dime in this business, but we're -- every decision we make is trying to make sure we can satisfy and take -- we've known as many people buying our vehicle, why we're the only game in town, and that will just give us -- we want to be on version 2.0 when somebody else comes out with version 1.0.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.

Mark Delaney

The first question is on the liquidity target that the company articulated by year-end. Can you provide more details on what you're thinking in terms of working capital that may need to be invested this year to support the ramp and also support the sales and operational parts of the business, what's embedded within that liquidity target?

Steve Burns

Sure. Well, I'll start off here, and then I'll turn it over to Julio. We just wanted everybody to know that with no funding, we can get trucks out this year, which, again, we think is paramount. And so we're expecting to receive funding in the various manners, which we've discussed, and we expect the ramp to be basically what we had hoped, but we have to put the asterisk of, it's going to require us to be successful in our fundraising, which, again, we are going to be the only -- the electric pickup truck market as far as we're concerned just got a huge boost last week, right? And to have our model be almost the same, we feel that we should keep our ramp. And that we have -- being debt-free, an ATVM loan optionally, we feel we will be there. But we wanted to make sure everybody knew that worst, worst case, we are still making pickup trucks this year.

Julio Rodriguez

Yes. The key item of working capital, obviously, is inventory. And slowing down the ramp save us in inventory. But I mean we obviously -- I mean we need to get working capital financing. And so I mean that's what we're pursuing. So as soon as we get the capital financing, definitely, we're going to start ramping up again.

Mark Delaney

Got it. Okay. And my second question was on the ATVM loan opportunity, and you spoke a little bit about that on your last earnings call. And then you talked about in the press release today about hoping to complete that in the next few months. I think you said before, I mean, this is a pretty extensive diligence process that the government goes through. So maybe you could talk a little bit about what they may have already done in terms of their diligence process and what they may still need to do and kind of where that next few months potential time frame is coming from?

Steve Burns

Okay. I'll jump in and then let Carter take it. But of course, we got to be sensitive to their confidentiality, but I don't think it's a secret that they look technically at you. They look financially at you. They look EPA-wise at you. They look at market demand for your product. They're very -- these are senior folks, right? They've been doing this for a long time. I don't think there would be a Tesla if they didn't get this loan back in the day, right? So they're very conscious of all of it. And I think it's important to note they have not made a loan in a while. So the fact that where this knee-deep with them is really encouraging to us. And we -- I don't know if I'm allowed to say we're optimistic or not, but we feel good about it. Carter?

Carter Driscoll

Yes. So Mark, just to tie it into your liquidity question earlier. So that, it doesn't play any role in the liquidity numbers that we provided you with our modified production ramp. They've done, as Steve said, several rounds of due diligence. We believe that so far, they've been favorable. We cannot comment on any timing, but we believe that we're progressing at the timeline that we originally thought we would. And we're hopeful that we will reach a stage such that we could potentially come to terms. So we can't comment on the timing of the application.

Operator, we‚Äôll take the next question please.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Harry Nikel with Wolfe Research.

Harry Nikel

I think the first thing I wanted to talk about was just how we think about costs in the BOMs going forward. In your first investor deck, you talked about a $42,000 BOM now and a $37,000 BOM in 2024 when you get to 107,000 units. Obviously, just sourcing expectations have changed, you've brought a lot in-house. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about the BoM now and how you're thinking about the BOM in 2024 and what all the moving parts are there?

Steve Burns

Sure. This is Steve, Harry. Just to put it in context, we have probably 3,000 parts in the vehicle, which is very low for a vehicle, 2,000 of them we purchase, right? Just to kind of frame it up. We have -- we're the only full-size electric coming out with 4 electric motors. Everybody else has 2, right? But we don't have things like driveshafts and new joints and gears and differentials. So it's a trade-off back and forth. We make our own motors so that we can control the cost of them. We expect to drive that down significantly over time, right? We make our own battery packs so we can control the cost of those. We have our cell deals, but the pack is a big part of it, the physical pack. And I don't know if you heard on there, but the 6,000 cylindrical cells that go into every Endurance, our goal is not to have a human hand touch those. So that, of course, dramatically starts to lower your cost.

Do we know all this upfront? We know aspirationally, we wanted to get there. We're pleased that we are on course to do all that. So while we don't talk directly about our BOM, I think electric vehicles are going to be less expensive than anybody dreamed going forward here over time because the supply chain is ramping up, right? It floats all boats when somebody is making an electric air conditioner or somebody that's going to do 1 million gasoline trucks, but it's an electric air conditioner, so we get to use it as well. So even gas trucks don't like to have a fan belt with a compressor on it anymore like the old days.

So all the supply chain moving towards electric as it starts to become more and more kind of generally known that everything -- now that the #1 vehicle in the planet is going electric, it's even -- it just moves the needle. So we try to control everything we can that's unique to us, but we buy a lot of stuff. And even the cells -- of course, I think everybody is aware that sales continue down. We're working on our own cells even that -- and lots of people are working on their own cells for 3 or 4 years down the road, and they're just coming down. They're getting safer. They're getting more dense, and they're coming down in price. So everything is moving directionally the right way.

I've been in businesses where things are moving in the opposite way. But here, price-wise, quality-wise, the number of choices we have and some of the components, everything is moving directionally correct. I mean the electrification of trucks is happening in America.

Carter Driscoll

Don't forget, Harry, those numbers you cite were pre-COVID. So it's really not apples-to-apples to where we are with the industry supply -- industry-wide supply issues. So the comparability is difficult at this point.

Steve Burns

Yes.

Carter Driscoll

But you have to hold that level out. So that's going to subside.

Harry Nikel

No. Totally, I mean -- so at a high level, then maybe the BOM is a little bit higher now, do you think about the mid-decade BOM materially different from that 37,000 number that you've given pre-COVID since it does seem like some sort of pre a lot of these issues?

Steve Burns

Yes. Mid-deck, and of course, again, what we're doing with our motors and our power electronics that run those, the big cost in electric vehicle are the drivetrain and the battery, of course. Everything else is not too far from a conventional vehicle, especially now that conventional vehicles are using things like electric air conditioners. So I think it's going to be better than we forecasted, but that's just kind of globally looking at the way the world is going. Again, what happened last week really changed -- that was a watershed moment. We think it's just going to be 2 full-sized electric trucks for a while for years to come here. And we're right with them competitively price-wise. So the temporary increase from COVID and everybody, even gas vehicles all increase their prices this year. So we think that will subside over time. We don't think it's going to have a long term. But I think a much bigger driving force than that, the temporary issue of that is these tier 1 suppliers, there's just more and more of them, and that creates a horse race, and their work -- they're competing on price, we're doing as many electric vehicles as anybody in the truck space. So the old model where somebody was making 1 million gas vehicles, but they're making the same number of electric vehicles than us, it levels the playing field a lot.

Harry Nikel

Yes. Understood. That's helpful. And if I can just ask one more, like, obviously, the cash burn ticked up a bit this year. Can you sort of potentially provide some color on how we think about free cash flow breakeven just in terms of units or how we think about where volumes need to go for the company to start generating free cash flow given the cost structure, given everything that's going on right now?

Carter Driscoll

Yes. Remember, to keep this -- Harry, this is Carter. To keep this in context, we do believe the phenomena with the supply chain is temporary. So we're not ready to give an update on a specific breakeven target, but we don't think it necessarily differs from what we had originally thought going into plan because we believe this will subside.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.

Adam Jonas

First question is regarding preorders. I believe the last update was in January -- early January when you shared the over 100,000 preorder milestone. Can you provide an update of where we are today?

Steve Burns

Yes. Adam, this is Steve. I think we articulated that, that was a nice round number. And now that the betas were out, we've stopped at that 100,000 and we are converting folks over to what we call now vehicle purchase agreements. I think last time we announced, we had 20,000 of those or so. That's up to north of 23,000, I think. These -- although still can't be order orders because of -- we don't have the vehicle done and through regulatory yet, you're not allowed to take orders, but they have a lot stickier things. Some of them have down payments in them as we get close. When we got to start spending the money to make the vehicles, we're demanding down payments, things like that. So a lot more teeth than the old days. [Tom], can you just tell me, I'm a little low on 23,000? It's really around 30,000.

Adam Jonas

And those -- that 30 -- that around 30,000, they do include some form of a down payment or some of them do?

Steve Burns

Most of those. All the new ones do. And when we get -- I think it's within -- when we get 90 days from building, right, then down payments do, right? That takes the onus off of us to buy those parts ahead of times and more of a conventional model.

Adam Jonas

Okay, okay. And just a final one for me, Steve. It's a question on providing adequate capital to the company while recognizing the strategic value of your assets, the plant, your tooling, your market position, right, the time to market, all the things you mentioned. So I guess with -- if the goal is to add ballast and resilience to the company so that you can ramp efficaciously and be a strong financial partner that your commercial customers would really rely on you to be to see them through, right, for these work trucks, would you consider strategic alternatives, including potentially a sale of the company, as a mechanism to bring that capital in and crystallize that ballast?

Steve Burns

Well, it is -- we're in a very capital-intensive business. We think we do a great job of trying to do this for the least amount of capital, if anybody has ever tried this before. And again, getting to the milestone of crash test, you just don't see this. The 50 vehicle companies that have gone before us that didn't make it, it's not because there wasn't demand for their product. It's because they couldn't get this far. So we -- I don't think we've ever considered selling the company, but we are in discussions with a few strategics, large strategic investors, that, of course, would bring something a lot more than funding. But we do want to be known as -- obviously, it helps float all boats if we are strong financially, right? So somebody buying our trucks, knows we're going to be here to service them, somebody realizes we've got the wherewithal to test these appropriately, which we have with or without financing. We're not putting anything out that isn't -- we're really bent on 5-star -- maybe the safest pickup truck ever into the wall, and enough durability testing that we're all confident of how good this is.

And as we start to get folks like the Army looking at it, the -- it's starting to be apparent that the hubs -- the hubs motors are very, very good. Four motors, of course, is always better than 2. And so the superior traction thing we have, the simplicity we have, we're starting to get -- now that we're at beta, we're getting people are starting to realize what we're talking about here. And so we continue to evaluate the strength and what capital is available to us, the ATVM, for example, I think it's fair to say this. This is just my personal feeling. There would be no Tesla if they didn't get that early ATVM loan, right? It was a big one. And they paid it back early, and it's a huge success for the ATVM program. And that's the best money you can get, right? It comes with a pedigree of the DOE doing diligence on you to just make sure your technology and your market and your -- everything is good. And it's a very good price of money. There's other things out there not as good, but we -- in addition to -- obviously, government vehicles are going to start going electric. We want to be -- and government buys a lot of trucks. We want to be right in there. And there's a lot of the -- obviously, the $7,500 tax rebate instantly is great for our customers. Carbon credits are a great way to get us off the ground, but there's a lot of government help as well. So we're investigating all of that constantly, evaluating it.

Carter Driscoll

I mean, Adam, just directly, right? So we have no intention of not being an automotive OEM. There are a lot of ways we can take the facility in different ways we can monetize it. But right now, our plan is still to be an automotive OEM. But we will do everything possible to maximize shareholder value, and we will look at all opportunities. But right now, the plan is to remain to be an automotive OEM.

Steve Burns

Yes. Adam, I think of all people, you probably -- we feel like we're -- there's nobody going to come to market soon with a full-sized electric pickup truck, right? So there's no small companies coming behind us. We had a big announcement last week that brought the whole thing mainstream, right? The #1 vehicle is going electric. The other people that make gas pickup trucks have not shown their cards yet, timing wise. So to sell, when we're going to be the only 2 electric full-sized pickup trucks on the market for quite some time, no, we're -- selling is not anywhere in our vernacular.

Our next question comes from the line of Jon Lopez with Vertical Group.

Jon Lopez

I had 2, if you don't mind. The first one, I'm hoping you could maybe just level set us because there's been like a bunch of changes in the metrics you guys have offered these last few months. So number one, what were you viewing as the prior 2021 production target? And the commentary you've made today about production, is that only in a scenario where you're unable to get funding? It sort of reads like you're cutting production, but then you also introduced these caveats. So could you maybe just talk about this a couple of dynamics for a second?

Steve Burns

Sure, Jon. First and foremost, we would just want to be clear, and maybe we weren't super clear, we are -- we're saying, look, if we don't get any funding, which is not in our thought process, but if we don't, it's always good to know worst case, we might only make half of what we were going to make before, right? Obviously, we don't want to do that with a strong appetite by customers for this vehicle. And to be -- again, we're really -- first-mover advantage has proven to be very, very important in new technology like this. So we intend to bring capital in, in one or more of the various ways. And strategic is really attractive to us as well. But we fully intend to capitalize ourselves such that we can make our milestones. And just for -- to refresh you, for 2021, we are at 2,200 vehicles, 2,200 Endurances. The van won't come online until next year. And so we're only talking about this year for most things. So in simple math, we're going to be about 1,000 if we don't get any funding.

Jon Lopez

Okay. Understood. But sorry, just on the other side of that, if we see an announcement from you in the next little bit that you have secured funding, then we just sort of instantly assume you're back to the 2,200 figure?

Steve Burns

Correct. Correct.

Jon Lopez

Okay. Got you. That helps. And then -- sorry, just as in an adjunct, I guess, to that, does any of this -- do any of these perturbations in maybe the second half of this year, do you have any of a knockoff effects onto what you were anticipating to produce for like '22 or '23?

Steve Burns

I'm not quite following you there, Jon, I'm sorry.

Jon Lopez

I'm sorry. I'm just asking.

Steve Burns

Do you meant volume target for next year, Jon?

Jon Lopez

Exactly. What I'm asking is if you make any adjustments to your 2021 production, does that knock off to what you could do in '22 and '23?

Steve Burns

It really depends on the timing of the financing and how quickly we can secure. We're not ready to update 2022 numbers right now until we go and check out those different sources and opportunities and see what we can potentially raise, and then we'll update you as soon as we -- in short order and let you know what we think we can secure and then give you a more robust 2022 forecast update.

Jon Lopez

So the second bucket -- or sorry, my second question, I guess, that was all kind of one question. The second one is just -- and I guess you were asked this a little bit before. Maybe I'll try it this way. Given how far above where you thought 2021 spending was going to land, can you talk to us even just directionally about what '22 and '23 spending look like? Have you front-loaded significantly more of what you expected over a multiyear timeframe? Or is this kind of a new base from which we have to think about the next few years layering on?

Steve Burns

Good. I'm going to let Rich jump on that. But just as an example, right, the -- we're building a huge battery pack facility here, right? And we've said, I think it's going to be second largest in the country when it's fully up and running. We're doing that and anticipate -- because you just can't move quickly, right? So let's say, we get the funding and now we say, okay, now let's do everything we thought. Let's even do more than next year if we can. So we are continuing to keep our powder dry. We're trying to -- I think that's the question you're asking. The increased spending, we are trying to keep our -- have our cake and eat it, too, that if we have to pull a lever for funding and slow down a little bit, it doesn't preclude us from doing what we want to do once the funding is there, right? So -- or some clarity that we should put it on full speed. So we just don't want to handicap ourselves if we can. It's not a perfect science, but we are trying to maintain the big stock with the long tent poles, the long lead items like building out a battery factory. We're continuing down that road so that we are able to execute in what we wanted to.

Rich Schmidt

So to answer your question pretty quick, Jon, because of the timing. But most of the '22 plant is capacitized already for the 30,000 of the battery. Most of the hub motor to body shop to paint shop and general assembly has already tooled for that. Where we've cut back the tooling cost is mostly the body shop and stamping. So we go to more curb sets and soft tools. So we will have to go hard tools, which will be most of that cost. So the frame line and the body shop and the stamping shop is where we have to add the hard tools, too. So that will be where the increase will have to come in '22.

Operator

Our last question comes from the line of Ben Kallo with Baird.

Ben Kallo

Just on the battery strategy, could you talk a little bit about -- you guys mentioned you‚Äôre bringing cells in-house and how you are evaluating that decision. My second question is just on competition, going back to some of your earlier comments. You mentioned 2, your truck and someone else‚Äôs out in the market. And I just wonder how you -- I think you were talking about Ford, but I wonder how you segment Rivian‚Äôs who is come to market as well as Tesla coming to market in that group?

Steve Burns

Okay. Yes.

Ben Kallo

And then just finally, I guess, you probably said strategic 14 times. And so I was just wondering for -- what strategic means to you all. I mean I think the quick glance would be like an OEM, but like, should we like cast our net broader than that as we think about what a strategic investment would be?

Steve Burns

I think you're on the right track there, but it can be many things. A lot of people are in this business that can help us in some capacity. And so when we say strategic, we're not thinking -- it's not kind of tangential. It's a direct, big thing for us as far as help in addition to money. So it could be many things. It could be engineering, it could be a lot of parts. We have a GM parts deal, which has been invaluable to us. And we just learned that -- from that experience, we have learned that maybe we don't do everything by ourselves. And there's 100 years of automotive out there, and maybe we should. If somebody is interested in investing this could bring more than money, sometimes it's worth way more than the money. On the -- when I talk about first-mover advantage, and there will only be 2 of us, I'm talking strictly about a full-sized work truck. So Rivian, from what I understand is a midsized truck geared towards the adventure market. And Tesla‚Äôs Cybertruck, we're not sure what market it's aimed for, but I don't think it's for the worker. So that's what I mean by that. And then I'm going to let John Vo here kind of talk to you a little bit about our battery strategy, if that's okay.

John Vo

Yes. This is John Vo. For the battery cell, we're conducting research and development on that, just like any other serious OEM would have to do. If you look at a story from Tesla Motor, they have all this strategic partnership with Panasonic, LG Chem, Samsung. And pretty similar to them, we have that, but at the same time -- and anticipate with the supply/demand, right, in the future, and everyone know that the demand for the battery is much, much higher than what the supply can produce. So we anticipate that we're not going to be exemption to that. So that's why we have to anticipate some of the shortage, and we're starting to research now so that now in a couple of years down as well, we don't have a problem.

Operator

Thank you. There are no further questions. I will now turn the call back to Steve Burns for additional remarks.

Steve Burns

Thanks, operator. And I really want to thank everybody for -- I know we went a little over here, but this is a car business, and we're a start-up car business, so it takes a little while to explain. I think from our point of view, from management's point of view, of course, we don't like cost overruns. We don't like a supply chain that's bouncing around a bit. But that's just part of this business. What we are extremely excited about is strong demand for our product, and it's been validated now. Last week's announcement was basically our truck at our price point, and that's a big move to take the number one vehicle in the country and turn in electric. So really, we -- to be this close to production, to be first in that highly competitive marketplace, I hope everybody can appreciate why we're so excited.

Imagine entering into the U.S. pickup truck wars, right? It is fiercely competitive. We are coming in with a 75-mile per gallon, essentially a pickup truck that gets that kind of fuel economy. So that is -- that's a game-changing moment. So we -- and the big -- if I were watching us and trying to figure out if we are on course as we navigate this, to be this close, again, our guesses are getting better as we get closer to production. You can't -- since we're cutting new teeth here, a new path that nobody has ever cut before, we think we've been relatively close. And the crash test, right? If we had been really sideways on that crash test, it would set us back. So that is, to me, to us, the largest gating element. We have passed it. And so I think that should help dial in what's the execution risk of us actually getting there.

So I want to thank everybody again for being on the call, and we'll talk to you soon.

Rich Schmidt

Thanks, everyone."
Stay in a comfortable but stressful day job or follow my dream of starting my own business as an artist?,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/nkzuti/stay_in_a_comfortable_but_stressful_day_job_or/,turquoiseandteal,1,2021-05-26 04:59:05,2,/r/careerguidance/comments/nkzuti/stay_in_a_comfortable_but_stressful_day_job_or/,Advice,"I currently work in the finance realm. I started this job several years ago (been in the industry 10+ years) and was on a learning curve in this particular job when I began, but the money was way too good to pass up. It was nearly a $30k increase from where I was at in my prior job (also in real estate) The boss who hired me knew this and saw potential in me. Although I generally ‚Äúliked‚Äù my job it was extremely stressful and I would often come home crying, thinking about work late at night and checking my emails early in the morning. 

Anyway, fast forward a year after I started and some change and covid happened, at the same time my boss was moved to a new department and I began reporting to a coworker. I don‚Äôt think this coworker likes me that much. Anyway, I worked from home through the pandemic due to coworkers not wearing masks, etc in the height of it all. Well, during that year I felt like I got healthier... and felt like it was good for my marriage, etc. I felt like I had more time with my husband, family, I guess just felt less stressed and more balanced in life, ate healthier, walked more etc.

I also was able to spend some time in the past couple months before coming back to office working on my passion which is painting/artwork. Over the years I have created many murals and larger scale canvases for clients and when I have the energy to put towards it, I have been successful... usually making a few thousand dollars per month when I‚Äôm able to gather the time. I know if I was focusing full time I would be able to increase this significantly.

Anyway, I am now required to be 9-5 40+ hours of the week in the office and by the time I get home I feel too drained for much of anything. I have been in this field for 10 years... this job for 3... and have realized I was chasing the money in this field and genuinely do not have any interest in it anymore.

I feel like I have not much energy to devote to my art, because I am drained from working on analytical projects all day.. it‚Äôs extremely difficult to create art when you‚Äôre mentally exhausted from tough projects and draining financial spreadsheets. 

I‚Äôve also realized I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúfinance‚Äù person... I‚Äôm a creative person (don‚Äôt get me wrong, I enjoy the administrative/financial part of my art business too) but not doing it full time.

Anyway, I wonder... should I stay in a job I feel apathetic and have no care for... or should I take a chance and run with my dream of being an official artist full time... and become more ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù with lots of time devoted to it?

Because I have worked in this industry so long and am very, very frugal... and with savings, etc, my husband and I have been able to pay off our home. Husband has a decent job but I make at least double what he does. Despite that, I grew up poor and saw my family struggle.. which created a mindset in me to always try and make as much money as possible and work hard.... (maybe this is why I have the ability to be successful in something even as difficult as art) So there is a part of me that has a very difficult time mentally giving up a very large salary, and comfortable living to go for something as up and down as art... but when I‚Äôm painting a project I feel so accomplished and am so ‚Äúinto it‚Äù ... I haven‚Äôt felt that in a long time in my day job. 

Any advice?"

I'm in an online Finance 5-week summer course where the only grades are 4 tests, a little quiz, and the final. There's no homework at all, just a weekly test. I haven't heard of there being a curve either.  

My problem is, I started stong on the first test and got a 90, but on the second one I got a 65. Now my grade is down to a 77 and I'm panicking a bit. I didn't study the right content for the second test, hence the low grade. 

I need advice. Should I email my professor and ask about the test content each week? Should I ask about curves and extra credit? Has anyone been in my shoes that has some good wisdom?"
Switching from Operational Risk (banking) to the business side,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/nlfnoj/switching_from_operational_risk_banking_to_the/,Humpty-dumpty_,1,2021-05-26 20:21:10,1,/r/FinancialCareers/comments/nlfnoj/switching_from_operational_risk_banking_to_the/,Career Progression,"Hi y'all. Looking for some advice here on what would be the best course of action for me to pivot from Risk into the business side.
So I have joined my current small risk consulting firm right after graduation almost 2 years ago. Projects are mainly long term body-shop style staffing (marketed differently) across 3 or 4 banks (the main clients). The market (an EU country) is quite small and projects are assigned purely by luck. If you happen to be on the bench when there is an opening, you simply get staffed on that specific task, regardless of your path/speciality. After 2 years (and 2 big assignments and 3 small ones), I have found out that my path was slowly gravitating towards operational risk, pushed by my managers, which is not something I am specifically into. At the same time, other risk areas were not that interesting to me. When I have accepted the offer 2 years ago, I had no clear view about risk, in general, in financial institutions, and I jumped on the first financial industry opportunity to secure an entry level job (since I had a pretty limited choice) and get some experience. On the background side, I have completed 2 Masters degree in Finance and passed the L1 CFA earlier this year.
Now, due to major disagreements about the management style of my consulting firm (incl. being forced into unethical situations - yeah it sounds quite dramatic for a risk job), and out of boredom of this lack of transparency and control over my career path (coupled with a decreasing interest in risk), I am looking into a move out of consultancy and operational risk towards some other financial position. The issue remains that I am not really sure on what to pursue. The financial industry in the market is very traditional, with limited options (read almost no PE, IM... few local commercial banks, small branches and international custodians). Now my options are the following:
* Go for an internal position at a major custodian bank I had already been assigned to and in which I had a perfect cultural fit and enough executive exposure. I think that landing a job there would be quite easy, it's just a matter of timing and opportunity. My main concern is that I am not really sure about the career growth and progression options over there. I am also having doubts on whether custody is exciting enough for me.
* Go for another consulting firm (potentially a big 4 - I have previously been approached by some partners) but into another financial domain, noting that all consulting firms are more or less the same in this market - Big4 also does bodyshopping for most of their service offerings and client corporate culture is also very traditional. The upside is that I will keep the steep learning curve from consulting and progression (incl. compensation).
* Wait for an FP&amp;A opening at a big international company in any other industry. I am not really sure about what to expect in terms of career path and options for this one.
* Stick to my current job for another 2/3 years (for administrative immigration reasons) before moving to another neighboring country with more opportunities in the field.
What do you think would be the best option? Has anybody been in the same situation or did the same switch? Is it too late to get into business ?
Thanks a lot!"

"I am 45 years old make $206,000 (combined salaries), live in rural SC and work as a senior marketing manager.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/nlpyqj/i_am_45_years_old_make_206000_combined_salaries/,SnarkingonSunshine,1,2021-05-27 03:57:04,48,/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/nlpyqj/i_am_45_years_old_make_206000_combined_salaries/,Money Diary,"  \*\* Posting a day early because I don't know if I'll be online to do so tomorrow\*\*

Sorry this is tremendously long!!

**Assets and Debt**

***Retirement Balance (and how you got there):*** Currently at $385,000. I have been contributing 4% of my salary with an employer match in a 401(k) since I was around 30. I make changes to the investment mix every year or so and received some good profit-sharing deposits from my previous employer. My husband did not contribute to a plan up until about 5 years ago.

***Home Equity:*** $250,000. Mortgage loan for our home and land in 2016 for $315k with $60k down payment (from combined savings of myself and husband plus a small life insurance payout ($10,000) that I received from being widowed 5 years prior). Current home and land value is $500k. Still owe $250k.

***Savings account balance:*** $18,500

***Checking account balance:*** $11,877

***College Savings Account (but I do not count this as mine):*** $115,500

***Credit card debt (and how you accumulated it):*** No credit card debt. Had terrible credit in my early to mid 30‚Äôs and once I rebuilt it, I‚Äôve tried to not use credit cards. We have an emergency card with $0 balance.

***Student loan debt (for what degree):*** Student loans are paid off, graduated with a BA in Economics from a 4-year public college with $24k in loans in 2000 and paid off student debt about 15 years ago.

***Anything else that's applicable to you:*** I was widowed at 35 years old and received a $10,000 life insurance policy. My first husband was not employed and had mental health issues that led to his death. I was left with 2 children under 10, less than $1000 in the bank, and a credit score of 500. I rebuilt my credit over the next 3 years and remarried at age 40. I had never owned a home prior to my second marriage. 

**Section Two: Income (Combined with Husband)**

My salary: $117,000 per year + $19,000 annual bonus (varies based on performance but this was the amount I received this year)

Husband‚Äôs salary: $48,000 per year (law enforcement)

***Social Security:*** $1600/month for my children based on their biological father‚Äôs death (this goes into their college savings with some of it going for purchases such as a car for my daughter and special expenses)

***Farm Income:*** $22,0000. Husband does majority of the work, but my kids and I are responsible for a lot of the daily maintenance/feeding/care of livestock.

***Income Progression***: 

First Job: Assistant Brand Manager: $25,000. Worked here for 4 years and was given small raises each year to total $32,000. Left company to become a brand manager at a retail store for $35,000 per year. Company went out of business less than a year later, and I was unemployed for 3 months. Took a job at a consumer goods company as a marketing coordinator making $33,000. Promoted to assistant marketing manager 3 months later, raise to $38,000. Promoted again 3 years later to marketing manager at $48,000. Given a raise the following year to $55,000.  Steady cost of living increases for 4 years, then promoted to business development at $65,000. Promoted 2 years later and given another $10k increase. Got another raise 2 years later with salary of $88,000. Continued cost of living increases until I reached $100,000. I took another job (same title different industry) at the beginning of March of this year for $117K, but I hate my new job. I have been interviewing for new roles already for about a month.

***Main Job Monthly Take Home***: $8200 (combined both full time jobs) after deductions

***Retirement:*** $560 per month, Insurance: $730 per month, taxes: roughly $3500

***Side Gig Monthly Take Home:*** Around $1800/month depending on the season. Our family has a 25-acre farm where we also raise and sell dairy livestock, cut and sell hay seasonally, as well as raise rabbits and train 6-7 horses per year as our schedule allows. Spring and summer months usually are more profitable as we had lots of babies born in March that we are currently selling.

**Section Three: Expenses**

***Mortgage:*** $2200 per month, no HOA and homeowner‚Äôs insurance is escrowed into this amount

***Charity:*** $100 per month to our local youth foundation, $100/month to St. Jude‚Äôs Hospital, plus random things that come along ‚Äì probably total around $300 per month

***Electric:*** $325 (includes both our house and the barns located on the property)

***Wi-Fi/Cable/Landline:*** $180/month

***Cellphone:*** $455/month (we pay for 6 total lines including our kids and my husband‚Äôs parents plus a couple of tablets)

***Subscriptions:*** $320/month for 2 meals per week from Hello Fresh; $5.99 for Discovery+ and $8.99 for Hulu; $30/month for daughter‚Äôs Apple Music

***Pet expenses:*** $200/month for our house pets (2 dogs) plus $400/month for livestock food plus any additional medications or vaccinations needed.

***Car payment / insurance:*** $1800/month for 2 vehicles plus insurance, including insurance for our 16-year-old daughter whose vehicle is paid for.

***Paid hobbies:*** Roughly $200/month for my son‚Äôs travel baseball fees and $10/month for my daughter‚Äôs Cricut subscription

**Other:** 

$1200/month for farm equipment financing

$400/month in allowance for 2 children, ages 12 and 16 (12 year does household chores for $25/week and 16-year-old does more intense chores for $75/week)

***Diary:***

**Sunday**

9:00 - We slept in this morning because we spent several hours working outside on Saturday and were all exhausted. Shower, get dressed, go feed our animals together (we currently have 6 cows, 5 goats, 2 horses, 2 donkeys, and 4 rabbits), shower and go have brunch as a family:  $48 including tip.

Pick up online grocery order: $157.68 (this isn‚Äôt bad for a family of four including 2 very spoiled dogs, but we have a super busy week ahead and will probably order food or eat out every night, this is just our breakfasts, lunches and snacks!)

Forgot to order allergy medicine and some sunscreen, go inside and pick these up: $35.

Go by farm supply store, buy some sunscreen, hair conditioner, and a brush for the horses‚Äô manes: $28.49.

Stop by a local nursery/farmer‚Äôs market for plants. I am planning to plant my garden sometime this week, so I buy a dozen tomato plants, 6 cucumber plants, 4 squash and some green beans. These are the plants that seem to work well for me every year. While there, I also pick up a pint of strawberries and a pint of blueberries and buy some sugar-free jam for my husband. Total: $34.97

1:30 ‚Äì Fill up my SUV with gas for the week. We had a gas shortage recently and prices went up and seemed to have stayed there at $2.89 per gallon. One tank usually gets me through the week, but this is a busy week, so I will probably fill up again. $54.00

2:00 ‚Äì Arrive home, do house and outdoor work: Feed the animals, brush the horses‚Äô manes and tails and apply sunscreen, clean out the goat barn, and work on cleaning leaves out of the pool and add pool chemicals. Clean out filters every hour (gross!). Yesterday we got about half of our fence lines sprayed for weeds, but it looks like rain today so finishing that will have to wait until another day.

After the day, we are all too tired to cook so my husband runs out and picks up 2 pizzas takeout, we take one to my mom and dad as a surprise because it‚Äôs her favorite place - $40.00 after tip.

***Total:*** ***$398.14***

**Monday:**

Alarm goes off at 6:00, I snooze three times and finally force myself up. Shower, get dressed and head out to work. I commute 50 minutes to my job because there are almost no local jobs that pay what I earn in my area, which is very rural. Husband gets up with me, and the kids will sleep in until 8am. My husband is off this week, burning vacation time that we never use. He is rebuilding some of our fences and adding new barn space this week. Both kids are still remote. My daughter is a junior in high school and takes advanced courses so all her courses this semester were online through either the virtual academy or the community college, and we kept our son home due to my dad being higher risk, but both kids will return to in-person classes in the fall.

7:00am: Stop for a cappuccino and bagel on the way to work: $6.38.

Start the morning by working through emails. I took a vacation day on Friday, so my inbox is more full than usual. I just started this new job in March, we are considered essential work (telecommunications) so we are 100% in the office. I negotiated working from home 1-2 days per week when I accepted the job, but I really miss working remote and I regret taking this job. I have been interviewing for a role that would be 100% remote. I had my third interview on Friday, so I check my email to see if they have responded, but nothing is there.

I only have one meeting today and notice that most everyone on my team is either out on vacation or working from home today. I spend the morning working on a spreadsheet to calculate return on investment for all our promotional activity in 2020. My goal is to learn the business and try to determine which promotions give us the best bang for the buck so I can share this with our media planner as we finalize our 3rd and 4th quarter spend.

12:00: Just finished my morning project, so I stop to eat lunch at my desk, which is a slice of leftover pizza, a cup of blueberries and an orange from home.

2:00: Need to determine how much we spent to acquire customers in April for another product line. This is for our monthly sales and marketing reporting for the board of directors. I have never done this on my own before at my new company but I‚Äôm able to figure out all the calculations and save my work as a template for any potential future use.

3:00pm ‚Äì Feeling bored so I make some green tea and contemplate an afternoon snack. Got called into the CEO‚Äôs office for an impromptu meeting, which stresses me out. I dotted-line report to him so he randomly calls me to come in and talk about my onboarding here. I will leave work a little early today as my son has baseball practice from 6-8 tonight. His league tournament begins tomorrow night, as well as end of grade testing.

5:00 ‚Äì Arrive home in time to change clothes, feed the animals load the car back up with the kids and husband and we go to baseball practice. I chat with some of the baseball moms while we watch the kids. Also chat with my husband about his day and what all he got done at the house today. He and the kids fed all the animals before I got home from work. He‚Äôd also went to the farm supply store and bought food for the animals: $72.95.

9:30 ‚Äì After practice we pick up takeout (sorry you‚Äôll see a lot of this during this particular week!) and take it home to eat. $44.00 with tip

11:00 ‚Äì Scroll through LinkedIn, watch some TV in bed with my husband, read online news and celeb gossip, finally fall asleep. 

Total: $123.33

**Tuesday**:

6:30 ‚Äì Get out of bed and wake my son, who has state testing this week and must go to in-person school for the tests. Grab a banana, drop son at school at 7:30 (husband will pick him up at noon), head to work, stop on the way and get a latte and a salad for lunch later: $11.48.

10:00 ‚Äì Work has been busy as we got some extra promotional money so I run financials to see if we can afford an aggressive Memorial Day sale. Get my promotion/sale approved by my boss, talk to the creative director about changing our digital advertising and align on the sales dates and deliverables.

12:00 ‚Äì Eat a salad at my desk and continue working through lunch. I must train our retail sales associates and customer solutions teams on a new product launch, so I finish building my presentation deck and mentally rehearse for the first training session tomorrow.

3:00 ‚Äì Meet with my boss about some discrepancies I have found in our sales reporting since we acquired a company last year. Some members of their team are still operating a bit differently from our process, and their sales are not being captured in the system. This is easy to correct and good news because it means our sales aren‚Äôt as low as we thought they were. Schedule meeting with the department manager to talk through the importance of following processes.

4:00 ‚Äì Leave work, get home in time to change clothes and get ready for a baseball game. Tonight is the first game of the league tournament. Our sports foundation has a food truck at the game, and we buy an iced coffee for myself and husband, Gatorade for my son who is playing, and lemonade for my daughter. My son hits a triple! Our team wins 9-3, which means we are right back here tomorrow. $11

8:30 ‚Äì Leave the ballfield, stop and get Subway for dinner and take it home to eat. $24.79

11:00 ‚Äì Get into bed, watch a little TV, chat with my husband, and scroll on my phone a bit before bed. I realize I have not checked my email for a few hours and see that I have an email from the company I‚Äôm interviewing with. Get a rejection email that said they liked the case study I had to present, but went with a candidate who had more direct experience. I‚Äôm bummed but try to put it out of my mind and get some sleep. Woke up several times in a bad mood.

**Total: $47.27**

**Wednesday:**

6:00 - Get up without hitting snooze, shower, wake up my son, take him to school and head to work. Stop for a latte, extra-large today because I‚Äôm sleepy and bummed out, and have to do a first training class at 9:00. $4.79

9:00 ‚Äì Head into my training class. It‚Äôs fully in-person and we have about 25 attendees this morning (this is the first of 4 sessions). My company had the health department come onsite in late March for free vaccines, so 80% of the company is several weeks post-second vaccine. It still feels weird to be around so many people at once.

11:00 ‚Äì Training is finished, so I head to my desk to meet with my employee for her weekly 1:1. We talk about an upcoming conference she‚Äôd like to attend, so I have her make a list of the seminars she is interested in and ask her to give me a couple of sentences of how this will support her development plan so I can get the expense approved.

12:00 ‚Äì I‚Äôm taking a half day of personal time today, so I pack up my laptop and head home. My husband is doing physical training this evening, so I throw together a big salad and heat some frozen soup for lunch for myself and the kids.

3:00 ‚Äì Spend the afternoon working on a strategic plan for our commercial business. Current state is a bit chaotic and not well prioritized, so I finally work down to my recommended list of top 5 priorities for the year. Must review this with a team tomorrow so I work up until it‚Äôs time to log off for the day.

5:00 ‚Äì The kids and I feed our animals, clean the pool for about a half an hour (we are almost ready to officially call it open), water my veggie plants, and put a load of clothes into wash. Shower and get dressed for baseball, head to the field.

7:00 ‚Äì My parents, sister and her family all join us at the baseball game tonight. Buy snow cones for my nephews and lemonade for my daughter, iced coffee for myself and sister: $22.

9:00 ‚Äì We won again, yay! My son is starving, and my husband is almost home from his training, so we meet at a diner near the ball field to grab a quick dinner and talk about our day. $50 with tip

11:00 ‚Äì Watch TV in bed with my husband for a bit but we are both exhausted from the day, so we fall asleep quickly.

**Total: $76.79**

**Thursday:**

6:45 ‚Äì Overslept so I shower, throw on some makeup and throw on a jumpsuit and cardigan and head out the door. I am about 20 minutes late, so I forego my morning coffee and drive straight to the office and managed to arrive only about 15 minutes later than I planned.

9:30 ‚Äì The strategic plan review didn‚Äôt go so well as I misinterpreted what my boss wanted.  I‚Äôm still learning how to communicate well with my manager. He has a lot of sales experience but glosses over more of the marketing aspects, which is my job. On the flip side, I gloss over the sales portion‚Ä¶we agree to regroup later and refine the plan this afternoon.

11:00 ‚Äì Finished up another meeting to review changes to our website.  I thought this would be a simple meeting but there were a ton of questions and follow ups. The meeting ended up running 20 minutes late, so I think breakfast is a lost cause.

12:00 ‚Äì Spent an hour reworking the strategic plan to review again with my manager. Just need a moment here to whine about how very hard it is to change industries midway through your career. It feels like learning a whole new language, even though most of my marketing skills have been transferrable. However, today I am feeling frustrated with the learning curve. I miss my old coworkers and I miss being an expert in my field.

2:00 ‚Äì Got called into an emergency meeting with my department and the CEO. My manager has been fired. In the interim, I‚Äôm now reporting directly to the CEO. Good lord‚Ä¶. this really stresses me out. I‚Äôm going to try to stay focused. CEO calls me into his office and assures me that nothing has changed for me. I am still kind of shocked and stress eat a brownie that my co-worker gave me.

4:00 ‚Äì The office is buzzing and people are already gunning to be next in line for a promotion. I send an email over to the VP of the company I left in March, and hint at regret.

5:00 ‚Äì Fill up the SUV with gas on the way home. $52.00

7:00 ‚Äì Got home, helped my husband and kids feed all the animals, and take my son out for a birthday dinner. He is turning 13 tomorrow and I‚Äôm now the mom of 2 teenagers!! Since he has baseball tomorrow night and all weekend, we have not really planned a party but are taking him to a nice dinner. My son and husband order crab legs, my daughter and I order steak, and we all share while sitting out on the deck of the restaurant by a river, enjoying a gorgeous night. $155 including tip (I have a weird habit of always rounding up my tips to get to an even number)

9:00 ‚Äì My old VP emails me back and wants to talk to me about coming back to my old company in a new role. I immediately email her back and say I would love to talk more. She responds that she will call me tomorrow.

9:30 ‚Äì Stop and get some ice cream for the birthday boy! $17.34

11:00 ‚Äì Watch TV with my husband for a bit, talk about what an insane day I have had, and talk about his much less insane but physically exhausting day working on our fences. 

**Total:** **$204.34**

**Friday**

7:00 ‚Äì Slept in a little today since I‚Äôm working from home. Shower, throw on a t shirt and leggings and decide to forego makeup or hair styling. I do have two Zoom meetings, but I‚Äôll only be sharing my screen so I‚Äôm giving my skin a break. Say goodbye and good luck to my daughter who goes into school today for a final exam, then her junior year is officially in the books. Will need to pay for her SAT in the next couple weeks so make a mental note to have her schedule this.

8:00 ‚Äì Log into my computer, text with my employee for a few meetings about the atmosphere at the office, assure her she doesn‚Äôt need to worry about her future quite yet, and enjoy some coffee. Also, text with two of my former employees about how they are doing. I‚Äôve continued mentoring three people at my old company and we check in about twice a week. One of them is going to talk to her manager today about applying for an internal promotion, so we talk through her skills and strengths to get her prepared. The other one is having some issues with a coworker, so I give her some advice on how I used to deal with him when I was in the role. I really miss my old team‚Ä¶I managed a group of 4 women, and they were amazing. We crushed our business and had a great bond. Mental reminder that money isn‚Äôt everything.

9:00 ‚Äì Have my first Zoom meeting. I am training the retail associates today about our Memorial Day sale that starts tomorrow. I feel bad that our store associates are working over the holiday while the rest of us will be grilling out with our families, and yet here I am also making them feel pressured to get more sales. I am going to ask permission to have lunch delivered to them next weekend and on Memorial Day as a small token of thanks.

11:00 ‚Äì Zoom trainings are done and I do not have any more meetings today! Going to log out for a bit and make some lunch (veggies with ranch dressing and some crackers) and sit by the pool. Also decide to go brush my horse for a few minutes to help relax us both.

12:30 ‚Äì Block out a couple of hours to finish drafting my strategic plan. With my boss being fired, I‚Äôm not even sure what the next steps are so I send an email to the CEO and VP of finance to let them know I can review it with them next week in order to not lose too much momentum. Schedule meeting for Tuesday. Review my calendar for next week and realize it‚Äôs going to be busy at work, but at least my home life will be taking a little breather. My son does not start summer league baseball until after Memorial Day, ha!

2:30 ‚ÄìFormer employer calls and we discuss a couple of job openings at my old company. Conversation went well and I may not even have to formally interview for a role. Agree to also talk to the head of digital on Monday and weigh my options but they want me back and all signs point to this being the right move for me. Going to try to not think too much about it this weekend but hopefully we can make a move in the next couple of weeks.

3:00 ‚Äì Change gears and work on a project I have been chipping away at for a couple of weeks. Our income statement for one of the smaller product lines looks weird, I think it should have a higher profit margin than it shows. I look through all the product details on the P&amp;L (profit and loss worksheet) and realize that some items are missing. Email the financial analyst, and she finds them listed in a different product line. She‚Äôs going to rework the P&amp;L statement and we will review this with the executive team in a meeting next Thursday. Hopefully this will help show a much better picture of the business.

4:00 ‚Äì Decide to finish up for the day and spend some time cleaning the pool. My goal was to have it ready for swimming by this weekend because the temps are supposed to be in the upper 80‚Äôs, but we may have baseball games all day tomorrow and Sunday depending on how tonight‚Äôs game goes. Decide to keep cleaning anyway. My daughter is doing some above and beyond housework to earn extra money, so she cleans out the fridge and takes the garbage off (food going bad because we have eaten out ALL WEEK). Transfer her extra pay via Apple Pay to her account (weekly allowance is counted above). Cost: $20

5:00 ‚Äì Feed the farm animals, check on my husband (he‚Äôs been driving fence posts all day), give some treats to the babies and mama animals, take a quick shower and get ready for tonight‚Äôs game. 

8:30 ‚Äì My son‚Äôs team lost tonight‚Äôs game bad, and my son is taking it hard. I hate to see him so disappointed in his performance on his birthday (or any day really!). We talk about being a team and that one person doesn‚Äôt win or lose a game and remind him that they can win outright tomorrow and still make it to the championship. Stop at a local restaurant for delicious cheeseburgers and fries. While we are there, we run into my husband‚Äôs uncle, who buys my son a hot fudge sundae for his birthday. Give son a baseball jersey of his favorite player for his b-day gift (purchased 2 weeks ago). Cost: $75 with tip

11:00 ‚Äì Finally get into bed and have a busy day tomorrow so I set my alarm for 6:00 and fall right to sleep.

**Total:** **$95.00**

Saturday

6:30 ‚Äì No rest for the weary on weekends! Get up early and mow the yard (about 2.5 acres of our land is considered lawn and the rest is fenced for pastures or considered part of our small farm), while the kids and my husband do the weeding. Finally able to finish spraying the rest of the fences. Go feed the animals together as a family and clean out their water troughs. Go back inside, shower, have some Greek yogurt and fruit for breakfast, make a big cup of coffee.

10:00 ‚Äì Pack our cooler, and head out for today‚Äôs baseball games. After the loss last night, we must keep winning to make it to the championship game tomorrow. The boys get behind early but come back to a tie. We get some good hits going in the last inning and come back to win by one. I run out to a nearby store between games to buy more bottled water and Gatorade for my son, and some snacks for the rest of us. $24.87

4:00 ‚Äì Finally leave the ballfield after a long day but we won out the day and will be back tomorrow for the championship! Everyone is tired, hot, and dirty so we head home and each take turns in the shower. My son and daughter both have friends coming over for the night, so we spend a little time tidying up the house a bit. Take care of our evening farm chores (feeding all the animals, moving the goats into their barn in case it storms overnight and brushing the horses and applying their sunscreen and fly spray again).

7:00 ‚Äì All the kids are outside playing and hanging out, so I order a few pizzas and salads for everyone and go pick them up. Barely even have the energy to drive for pizza, much less cook. $55 with tip.

9:00 ‚Äì We decided to make an impromptu trip to my sister‚Äôs house to hang out for a little while and so they could give my son a birthday gift. The kids all play basketball in the dark while we catch up and have a glass of wine by the fire pit. I might have dozed off.

11:00 ‚Äì Back home and heading to bed for the night. Chat with my husband for a bit, decide what time we must get up in the morning and fall asleep almost instantly.

Reflections:

This was literally one of the craziest weeks I have had in a long, long time and would‚Äôve never guess all that transpired when I started the diary. We spent way too much eating out but had already planned to ramp that shit down starting this week. Overall, I think I could be saving more and spending less. Also I really need to workout more!"

How crypto could change the world: from replacing Binance to getting rid of Nestl√©.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nm5uw9/how_crypto_could_change_the_world_from_replacing/,chomskian1,1,2021-05-27 20:01:50,359,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nm5uw9/how_crypto_could_change_the_world_from_replacing/,POLITICS,"  

Given how early in the [Rogers Adoption Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle) for Crypto we are, I would like to take a moment so we can just imagine what this technological revolution, which I consider is the next huge step for human kind, could bring. I will emphasize some socioeconomic implications of descentralization, but I\`m mostly interested in listening to, and debating your inputs.

Blockchain and Crypto Currency are here to change the world forever.

**The implications of decentralization**

As you may know one of the core proposals of blockchain is decentralization, and with it we can optimize so many processes that this alone could be the revolution we are talking about. By eliminating intermediaries, we can save on the cost they add to the supply chain ensuring those that create the value, keep it. Or we can simply save on fees.

To quote the man himself:

Whereas most technologies tend to automate workers on the periphery doing menial tasks, blockchains automate away the center. Instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts Uber out of a job and lets the taxi drivers work with the customer directly. ‚Äì Vitalik Buterin.

To put it simply, imagine that you replace Binance (a centralized company) with a robot. A robot that you have programed so well, whose code you publicly audit, and that is so safe you can trust it with billions of dollars in liquidity pools, so it proceeds to host and operate the trading platform by itself. In case you didn‚Äôt know, this is already a reality! Many people here trade on those platforms on a daily basis. 

But this goes beyond replacing Centralized Exchanges with [Automated Market Makers](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/amm-what-are-automated-market-makers), Airbnb with a blockchain DApp that connects landlords and costumers, or even banks with complex smart contracts that allow you to borrow, save, tokenize physical assets, and so on. This goes way beyond.

Here is where I start to fantasize of the future. Think about replacing capital itself, think about getting rid of corporations. Lets dream of a world with [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization)s massive adoption.

With DeFi, we may no longer need a company like Nestl√©‚Ä¶

And specially not their investors. Of course, you will still need the people administrating, planning, monitoring, generating new ideas that adapt to their context, and creating innovative solutions for a complex world only humans can comprehend. But the figure of shareholders and CEOs that steal all the value that workers create and leave them with a tiny fraction of it, can disappear. This can be the basis of a once in a century transformation.

Just as an example: Nestl√®‚Äôs coffee growers in Colombia keep less than 10% of the final sale price, and barely make a living on it, so are actually abandoning the rural areas.

With Blockchain, DeFi and Smart Contracts, people like you and me can collectively fund such an operation, and then agree upon specific terms like wages by direct democracy, voting with our crypto holdings. Then we would proceed to allocate funds, hire ‚Äúdevelopers‚Äù which would ultimately be regular office jobs that keep the organization functioning. Once in operation we would frequently vote on decisions and results, which would ultimately keep the highest level of accountability for people working in the organization. This is already happening by the way, this is how some blockchain projects work today. We just haven‚Äôt applied it to industrial and physical supply chains yet.

Let‚Äôs go back to our project to replace Nestle. Imagine that an organization‚Äôs main goal is not to maximize profits for shareholders and bonuses for CEOs anymore. Instead, it‚Äôs the interest of regular people and the company‚Äôs collaborators that drive its actions.

Most likely, you and I will want to consolidate an efficient and effective supply chain, that is sustainable and keeps the dignity and wellbeing of its collaborators as a guiding principle. We are not longer at their mercy on issues like climate change, we can now take immediate action against it, or stop endangering and hoarding water supplies in classic Nestle fashion.

Also, we are making profits, so we are redistributing capital, and improving our quality of life, which will be most notorious in the most vulnerable communities, usually those that extract/harvest/mine raw materials. 

This is what could happen with the blockchain descentralization of business. And you could apply it to pretty much anything, but maybe initially it could be for low labor and capital intensive businesses. 

I‚Äôll give you another example. I work for a solar power multinational company. If you don‚Äôt know it, solar energy is essentially a financial product, most people working in these companies don‚Äôt care about the world, its simply that solar is a very safe and lucrative hustle, and all investors care about is having a nice return of investment (ROI). As of now, my company works exclusively for large scale corporate clients or the state itself, given that‚Äôs where the nice ROIs are, since they give you the projects that allow you to place large capitals at once. This means, as of today, we blatantly ignore the regular people that seek for our help and funding to power their farms and/or houses with solar energy. They‚Äôre not that profitable my boss tells me. This is shitty, and I‚Äôve thought of quitting several times.

But back to the point. Now, imagine once again, we get rid of the institutional investors. Now you and me create Reddit Solar Co, a DAO. Our only purpose is to facilitate access to electricity those without it, and to advance in the urban implementation of renewable energy. We help the world, make dividends that are automatically distributed by the DAO, and also our own Crypto is rising in value. 

And this is not the best.

**Let‚Äôs not forget of synergies.**

So, we just created a DAO that manufactures and distributes food globally right? Or maybe Reddit Solar Co. As an organization born on the blockchain, we won‚Äôt have to adapt to the state of the art innovations on the crypto world like an old steam locomotive attempting to adapt a warp drive on top of it. We were born in space.

From the beginning, our Ethereum based DAO could adopt VeChain‚Äôs solution for supply chains, Cardano will help us to give an integral solution to the unbanked communities that provide our raw material, they now have IDs, access to DeFi and education. The land deeds and legal documents that relate to our enterprise are certified by LTO Network, we move money internationally with XRP or Stellar, and don‚Äôt worry, we use Polkadot to ensure proper blockchain interoperability. 

Too complex for you? Don‚Äôt worry, you don‚Äôt even have to know or care about this, leave that to others. You‚Äôre into finance. Maybe sales is your thing and there‚Äôs a little Michael Scott in you. Or you\`re into social work and want to supervise our community engagement at the start of the supply chain. Just go do your thing! You don‚Äôt necessarily have to be involved in all of this.

All you know is you do your job and receive your crypto salary.

Just as computers and the internet changed the world forever, and not only had economic implications but also changed our culture, routines, work lives and ways to interact with each other, crypto will. We are just so early; that all we can do for now is dream.

**You‚Äôre having too much hope in humanity dude‚Ä¶**

Sure, I may be making some optimistic assumptions on the motivations of humans, I may be saying that we will use this technology for good, and that we care about each other, and that‚Äôs one way to look at it. But we could also argue in favor of this from a sceptic perspective: even if you don‚Äôt care about the collective wellbeing of your community, it‚Äôs in your interest to live in a safer environment right? Ergo you want to reduce poverty. Its also in your interest to stop global warming so organized human life can continue to exist, or to make sure you and your children will have water and food in 50 years, that‚Äôs why you will want to use technology for good even if you only care about yourself. Also lets not forget the powerful incentive of profits. Crypto has the clear potential to achieve all of this.

Most of the current generation of crypto projects will be ready and operating within the next 3 years, so all we will need by then is the will to use this technology for good, and the vision to change the world.

This is just the beginning, we will be killing industries but giving birth to others we could have never imagined before."
PSA: Don't sleep on DeFi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nm7hrc/psa_dont_sleep_on_defi/,Vitalz1000,1,2021-05-27 21:30:09,22,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nm7hrc/psa_dont_sleep_on_defi/,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,"I've been part of the crypto world since late 2017 after watching my 3k investment turn to 30k and then to 200$. Of course I didn't sell at the peak, I was naively waiting for it to turn into millions. After losing everything, I sort of forgot about it and moved on, which in hindsight was the biggest mistake I could make. 

Now that I'm wiser and battle tested, I'm never leaving. Even if we dive into a deep bear market where I lose 99% of my investments, I will keep buying the projects I believe in. Decentralized finance is mind blowing and will change everything. 

If you haven't taken the time to research and learn about it, please do, right now. DeFi is very expensive on Ethereum so it's best to start with Polygon, which is a game changer and is growing at the speed of light. Now is the time to take advantage as they have a ton of incentives to use the network (you'll be paid in Matic to deposit and even borrow). Note that you will need Metamask or a similar wallet for the following steps:

* First you need to move your assets onto the Polygon network [here] (https://wallet.matic.network/). There will be an ETH gas fee, but once your assets are on Polygon transactions costs are essentially nil. 
* Once your assets are on Polygon, there are many opportunities to take advantage of incentives, some of the ones I use are AAVE, Curve Finance and PoolTogether. 

Polygon's ecosystem is huge and can be found [here](https://polygon.technology/). 

Obviously this is not an exhaustive guide (more of a rant) but please take the time to research and learn about this. As a Banker, my mind was blown when I was able to borrow money from AAVE without even giving them my name. 

This is a great channel about yield farming on Polygon [link](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheTaikster)

This is the future."

Understanding GME with Supply and DEMAND,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmnask/understanding_gme_with_supply_and_demand/,half_confused,1,2021-05-28 10:04:26,16,/r/Superstonk/comments/nmnask/understanding_gme_with_supply_and_demand/,Education üë®‚Äçüè´ | Data üî¢,"Hi everyone, 

After reading the recent DDs, I found myself confused and asking the same questions that I had before‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs preventing the shorting Market Makers or Hedge funds from more naked short selling to keep driving down the price? 

Why is the stock price not $0?  Not $40? Etc.?  

A lot of the DDs have been focused on the Supply side of things, and not so much the **Demand** side of things.  We know there are a lot of apes here in this subreddit, but we have a lot of them outside of this subreddit too. **The insane amount of demand for GME is what is keeping the price at where it is.** 

I used what I remembered in high school Economics to explain it to myself this morning. 

Here‚Äôs a standard graph showing supply and demand curves: 

\*Note: In Economics, things mentioned below assume everything else remains the same. 

Figure 1. In the stock market, the price of the stock is usually where the supply curve and demand curve intersects.  Sellers are usually willing to supply more of the stock when the price increases. The demand of the stock increases when the price is lower. 

[Figure 1. Supply and Demand Curves](https://preview.redd.it/59r5smk3or171.png?width=1240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb9eebd14875fd4e00249d1cfdc46334ae34e699)

When Citadel and others are naked short selling GME, it shifts the supply curve and drives down the price (Figure 2). 

Figure 2. 

[Figure 2. Shorting shifts supply curve ](https://preview.redd.it/nap3a0t4or171.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5efcc8342410ac4dd46f1ccf6880d69b259e10ab)

Citadel and others can keep shorting and shorting, but why is GME not at $0? 

The demand curve may actually plateau and never reach $0 (Figure 3).  

Investors are seeing **intrinsic value in GME (deep f-ing value)** and will buy up all there is to offer at a certain price point. In other words, there is **insane demand for GME** at a certain price. 

Figure 3. 

[Figure 3. Intrinsic value of GME results in insane demand at a low price point](https://preview.redd.it/y76ih7n5or171.png?width=1244&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=346eb4557e86e543b14ec70962f51a4b278bcf28)

Okay, so maybe GME will never be $0 ‚Ä¶ but why is it not $40 anymore?  Or not $180 anymore? 

So while Citadel and others can shift the supply curve, Ryan Cohen and team, üêà, and Apes ü¶çhere are shifting the demand curve (Figure 4). Shifting the demand curve changes how much GME is wanted at every price. 

By the Gamestop transformations, GME having no long-term debt, can‚Äôt go bankrupt, and have cash to spend have shifted the demand curve and raised the intrinsic value of the company. **üöÄüöÄüöÄ** **We have a new floor**. New DD shared here also helps shift the demand curves. **üöÄüöÄüöÄ**

Figure 4. 

[Figure 4. Gamestop, Ryan Cohen, Apes are shifting the demand curve and raising the floor. üöÄ](https://preview.redd.it/bbmx5k27or171.png?width=1638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d17f039d27df2cd30ad52b57d818b5d18623bba1)

What are factors that can shift the demand curve (increase demand)? I did a quick google search and here‚Äôs a quick list:

* Change in expectations about future prices 
* Changes in taste/preferences (more popular)
* Changes in composition of population (getting more people who are more likely to buy)
* Increase income
* Related goods (price of substitute increases or price of complement decreases) - less relevant here I think 

FUD, Shills, and CNBC/media are trying to shift the demand curve the other way (decrease demand) by scaring us and retail investors, but we know better. 

Source on factors that shift demand curve: [https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/supply-demand-equilibrium/demand-curve-tutorial/a/what-factors-change-demand](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/supply-demand-equilibrium/demand-curve-tutorial/a/what-factors-change-demand)

Are we destined to hate working for anyone but ourselves?,https://www.reddit.com/r/estp/comments/nmwyvc/are_we_destined_to_hate_working_for_anyone_but/,everygirl_,1,2021-05-28 20:40:20,10,/r/estp/comments/nmwyvc/are_we_destined_to_hate_working_for_anyone_but/,ESTP Needs Help,"I‚Äôve held 3 different jobs post college, all in different areas of finance, and, with each, after 6-8 months I find myself bored, irritated, and unfulfilled. 

With each job it was different. My first was my favorite but I was also right out of school working 80+ hours a week in excel which wasn‚Äôt sustainable. Great team and people and corporate culture though... 

Second gig was intrapreneurship. Sole full time employee dedicated to launching a niche finance product. It effectively failed... something I realized was going to happen about a year in but stuck around longer anyhow. I liked the people enough, but definitely felt a little trapped behind my desk from 9-5 every day. I‚Äôm not sure if it was just the sheer boredom (likely) of having nothing at all to do but having to just sit there, or coping with failure, but I decided to move on 

Since I‚Äôm extroverted and love talking to people, I moved to a business development job in finance. It‚Äôs not sales. It‚Äôs all passive relationship management... no critical and/or critical thinking at all anymore. Gets me out of the office and meeting with people. However, it‚Äôs infuriating because no clear accomplishments come out of these interactions and therefore, they feel pointless. The entire premise of this job lacks practicality: it‚Äôs all about working harder not smarter, doing more solely for the sake of doing more. I basically just hop on the phone and chat with hundreds of people 2x a year... why 2x? Unclear. Just an arbitrary number. Then my boss is known for being very difficult to work for, emotional, erratic, narcissistic, and irrational...basically it‚Äôs an unhealthy situation causing me severe anxiety (some thing I‚Äôve almost never experienced as a fun loving ESTP) 

I, like many of you, don‚Äôt know what to do next. I have the opportunity to go back to a more technical role, where‚Äôd I use some analytical skills but also have more people-facing interactions like hiring/managing vendors, negotiating commercial real estate sales etc. I‚Äôd also get to manage a team, which is the one thing I‚Äôve loved about my current job. It‚Äôd be rigid in that I‚Äôd need to be in an office from 9-5 but would work for people that 1) I know trust and respect 2) I consider to be smart and 3) are very practical. It‚Äôd be nice to have goals and clear things to accomplish every day but not sure if, once i get up the learning curve In 6-8 months, if I‚Äôll be bored again. 

What do you all do for work? Are careers for us more about picking and choosing which of (our many!) strengths we want to use and then filling the ‚Äúholes‚Äù with hobbies and other interests? Can we sacrifice some ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù from a scheduling perspective but still be content?"
Understanding GME pre-MOASS floor price with Supply and Demand,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nmzf30/understanding_gme_premoass_floor_price_with/,half_confused,1,2021-05-28 22:46:30,54,/r/DDintoGME/comments/nmzf30/understanding_gme_premoass_floor_price_with/,ùòúùòØùò∑ùò¶ùò≥ùò™ùòßùò™ùò¶ùò• ùòãùòã,"Hi everyone,

After reading the recent DDs, I found myself confused and asking the same questions that I had before‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs preventing the shorting Market  Makers or Hedge funds from more naked short selling to keep driving down  the price?

Why is the stock price not $0?  Not $40? Not $180 anymore, etc.?

A lot of the DDs have been focused on the Supply side of things, and not so much the **Demand**  side of things.  We know there are a lot of apes here in this  subreddit, but we have a lot of them outside of this subreddit too. **The insane amount of demand for GME is what is keeping the price at where it is.**

I used what I remembered in high school Economics to explain it to myself this morning.

Here‚Äôs a standard graph showing supply and demand curves:

https://preview.redd.it/tt1667flfv171.png?width=1240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecb9bb07d7927a9476d536b16ed8dda6116b47e4

**Figure 1. Supply and Demand Curves**

\*Note: In Economics, things mentioned below assume everything else remains the same.

Figure  1. In the stock market, the price of the stock is usually where the  supply curve and demand curve intersects.  Sellers are usually willing  to supply more of the stock when the price increases. The demand of the  stock increases when the price is lower.

Figure 2.

https://preview.redd.it/ynenno3mfv171.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45fba8cf263f0fe8c96d41de9f399e779e39c460

**Figure 2. Shorting shifts supply curve** 

When Citadel and others are naked short selling GME, it shifts the supply curve and drives down the price (Figure 2).

Figure 3.

https://preview.redd.it/i9dt9o3nfv171.png?width=1244&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c897d0f3502c4eadc49a22e78983704afe55be17

**Figure 3. Intrinsic value of GME results in insane demand at a low price point**

Citadel and others can keep shorting and shorting, but why is GME not at $0?

The demand curve may actually plateau and never reach $0 (Figure 3).

Investors are seeing **intrinsic value in GME (deep f-ing value)** and will buy up all there is to offer at a certain price point. In other words, there is **insane demand for GME** at a certain price.

Figure 4.

https://preview.redd.it/xddg3b4pfv171.png?width=1638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad536a0147cb6a93c67f0eadd87e138b8693546a

**Figure 4. Gamestop, Ryan Cohen, Apes are shifting the demand curve and raising the floor. üöÄ**

**Okay, so maybe GME will never be $0 ‚Ä¶ but why is it not $40 anymore?  Or not $180 anymore?**

So  while Citadel and others can shift the supply curve, Ryan Cohen and  team, üêà, and Apes ü¶çhere are shifting the demand curve (Figure 4).  Shifting the demand curve changes how much GME is wanted at every price.

**By  the Gamestop transformations, GME having no long-term debt, can‚Äôt go  bankrupt, and have cash to spend have shifted the demand curve and  raised the intrinsic value of the company. üöÄüöÄüöÄ** **We have a new pre-MOASS floor**. New DD shared here also helps shift the demand curves. **üöÄüöÄüöÄ Also like to add that continuing to support and buy from Gamestop will  increase the value of GME (and the pre-MOASS floor) as well. :)**

# To emphasize, I am referring to the pre-MOASS floor. The current floors before the squeeze. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

What are factors that can shift the demand curve? I did a quick google search and here‚Äôs a quick list:

* **Change in expectations about future prices**
* **Changes in taste/preferences (more popular)**
* **Changes in composition of population (getting more people who are more likely to buy)**
* Increase income
* Related goods (price of substitute increases or price of complement decreases). AMC may be seen by some investors as a similar substitute stock as GME, but it's not! That might still impact our demand curve nonetheless. 

FUD,  Shills, and CNBC/media are trying to shift the demand curve the other  way (decrease demand) by scaring us and retail investors, but we know better.

Source on factors that shift demand curve: [https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/supply-demand-equilibrium/demand-curve-tutorial/a/what-factors-change-demand](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/supply-demand-equilibrium/demand-curve-tutorial/a/what-factors-change-demand)

Note: I am not an economist, just trying to make sense of things myself. Feedback welcome. Not financial advice.

**TLDR:  Gamestop transformations, supporting Gamestop, and DDs are constantly increasing the  intrinsic value of GME and its demand. This results in an insane amount  of demand at the new floor price. IMO, this is why GME will never be $0  or whatever the old floor price is.**

IMO, also not financial advice, of why we won't see $180 again, because investors (retailers and institutions) will gobble up shares of GME before it ever hits that price again."

1. **The Lido stETH investment is now complete**, following a successful community vote. 15,000 ETH was invested from the mutuals capital pool. The engineering required to make this investment happen will also allow us to pursue other investment opportunities in the future with less development required.

This is the mutuals very first investment from the capital pool. It‚Äôs a huge step for the mutual. Congratulations to the engineering team and to our Investment Hub.

2. **Yield token cover has been listed and is now open for staking**. This includes yDAI v2, yUSDC v2, ycrvstETH, 3pool and sETH. Yield Token Cover protects members against their yield bearing tokens de-pegging.

If your yield-bearing token de-pegs in value by more than 10%, you may claim up to 90% of your loss by swapping your yield-bearing token for a claim payment.

* De-peg happens for more than four continuous hours.
* Claims go through group claims assessment process where a full-member governance vote is held to determine if de-peg is valid.
* Members who had cover live at the time of the de-peg can swap their yDAI tokens at a 90% return rate for the same underlying covered currency (in this example, USD/DAI).
* Swap ratio is determined by the value of the token right before the de-pegging.
* Members can choose to swap some or all of their yDAI for a 90% return rate.
* After claim payout, cover period ends

More info on the types of cover can be found here: [https://nexusmutual.gitbook.io/docs/users/types-of-cover](https://nexusmutual.gitbook.io/docs/users/types-of-cover)

3. **MCR calculations are now fully on chain**. MCR, which used to be updated daily, will now take the existing MCR value and move it towards the target each time someone:

* Buys NXM
* Sells NXM
* A claim is paid

## Nexus Mutual Sponsorship: ETH Global‚Äôs Hack Money Hackathon

This proposal is for Nexus Mutual to participate at the pillar sponsor level for ETHGlobal‚Äôs Hack Money ([https://defi.ethglobal.co](https://defi.ethglobal.co) 1) coming up June 18th-July 9th, 2001. The cost would be $28,000 for the mutual and would result in thousands of developers seeing and engaging with the mutual.

[https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/nexus-mutual-sponsorship-eth-global-s-hack-money-hackathon/547](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/nexus-mutual-sponsorship-eth-global-s-hack-money-hackathon/547)

## Creating More Capacity

One of the issues that the mutual is facing right now is a lack of capacity on the most popular projects, including Aave v2 and Curve. This discussion proposes increasing the capacity factor for these, allowing for a given amount of staking to open up more capacity.

[https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/creating-more-capacity/544](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/creating-more-capacity/544)

## Capital Pool and/or Risk Assessment Model Bounty

BraveNewDeFi discusses whether it would be beneficial to create a bounty for a developer to create an educational model. It would be a ‚Äúset bonding curve with various formulas built into the model that members can play with (i.e. change the amount of ETH in the capital pool) to see the impact of MCR% and price.‚Äù

This idea should allow new members to more easily understand and visualize how changes in different factors could impact the growth of the mutual. Some members believe this complexity makes it harder to attract new capital.

[https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/capital-pool-and-or-risk-assessment-model-bounty/541](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/capital-pool-and-or-risk-assessment-model-bounty/541)

## Community Corner

‚ÄúOn March 24th, the Nexus Mutual Community Fund was born! Since our inception we‚Äôve been busy bringing value to our community by way of grants and bounties.

So far, we have paid out a total of 300 wNXM for retroactive services that benefit the mutual. Another 8 wNXM are to be paid as bounties to our Protocol Cover contest winners.

300 wNXM is also allocate in bounties, to be paid for research analysis papers on BSC‚Äôs Pancake, Bunny Finance and Terra‚Äôs Anchor Protocol.

## Nexus Governance

Looking for an opportunity to have your voice heard and ask questions on the direction of the mutual? Don‚Äôt forget to engage on our Nexus Mutual Forum. We have new discussions posted for your feedback and ideas that require consideration before heading to Snapshot for voting.

[https://forum.nexusmutual.io/](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/)

Once these posts have been in consideration on the forum for seven (7) days, they will then head over to Snapshot for off chain voting which means no gas fees!

[https://snapshot.org/#/community.nexusmutual.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/community.nexusmutual.eth)

## Upcoming Opportunities

1. We are searching for a video producer to create a 45-second piece for the upcoming Hack Money event in June. We‚Äôre looking for a fast moving and highly creative piece to showcase Nexus and the prizes we will be offering at the event.
2. We are still looking for a Discord Bot aficionado. We want to create an automatic integration from our other social platforms to our Discord, to generate more community engagement.
3. The Fund is open for business and we‚Äôd love to hear from you if you have any ideas, potential projects and collaborations. The process is fairly simple and starts out with you filling in our application form here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffxNujFUWKPhFFol9KqTGqevcPTc4lSgufdrY-2COZ8LwQ5Q/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffxNujFUWKPhFFol9KqTGqevcPTc4lSgufdrY-2COZ8LwQ5Q/viewform)

If you are interested or know anyone for these two opportunities, have them DM Kendrea on Discord!

And should you have any questions, just schedule some time to chat with us here: [https://calendly.com/nexusturtles/15min?month=2021-05](https://calendly.com/nexusturtles/15min?month=2021-05)

Please remember, there is no community without you!‚Äù

## Other Updates

## Investment Hub

Our investment hub is being lead by our Board Member, Rei. This hub is still being fully established but has already successfully led the investment of 15,000 ETH into Lido stETH this week following Rei's proposal to the forum. The investment hub is currently creating a detailed investment strategy that is expected to be released in the coming weeks.

There remains an RfP for those who are interested in actively investing some of the mutuals assets: [https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/request-for-proposal-capital-pool-investment-manager/511](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/request-for-proposal-capital-pool-investment-manager/511)

## Marketing and Communications Hub

Our Marketing Hub is close to being setup. BraveNewDeFi and Jer979 will be co-leading this hub. With multiple decades of marketing and communications experience between them, they will help to drive more cover and capital growth for the mutual. A proposal and more information for this hub will be released soon.

Our Community Engagement Hub (supported by the community fund) is looking for community members who want to get involved with upgrading our Discord, or who have other relevant skills to promote community engagement. If this sounds like you, get in contact with Kendrea on Discord!

## Core Team

Internally, the core team is focussing on distribution and the engineering team has been busy with upgrading Nexus Mutual to allow for stETH investments and to put MCR on-chain. The engineering team are now planning their next priorities and we will share more details in our next newsletter.

## Spotlight On: BraveNewDeFi

We want to draw attention to the value that our members provide to Nexus Mutual.

@BraveNewDeFi  is one of our valued Discord Moderators, community fund recipients and loyal Nexus Mutants. He‚Äôs thoughtfully given hundreds of hours of his time to answer thousands of questions on Discord and the forum, from new and experienced members alike.

BraveNewDeFi is currently working on upgrading all of our documentation to make it easier for new members to understand NXM, which will grow our capital pool. He came up with our new Hub model, which will be the basis for the growth of NXM as a decentralized entity. He‚Äôll also be leading the Marketing Hub himself.

Thank you, BraveNewDeFi, for everything you do to support Nexus Mutual and our incredible community!"
Theory on the trendline,https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/nn0p3k/theory_on_the_trendline/,Hellrime13,1,2021-05-28 23:46:00,3,/r/amcstock/comments/nn0p3k/theory_on_the_trendline/,DD,"I have a theory on the trendline. As many of us have seen, $AMC and $GME have been following the same trendline essentially since the end of January. This is important to know, especially since many have pointed out that during this run up the two stocks are no longer following the same trendline. Now why is that? After months of being able to look at the trendline between both stocks, and knowing that if one takes a dip, you just have to look at the other to know when the shorts were going at it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we know for a fact that news organizations and hedge funds are watching these subs. Everyone already knows that comparing the two is useful information to know when they're pulling out the bag of tricks, they do too. The news organizations and finance sites have made it a point to shine light on this as well. I think that is the plan.

&amp;#x200B;

That is why I think that the two stocks not following the same trendline, as they have done pretty much since January, is to keep investors in the dark. They can manipulate $AMC freely since that is one piece of information that won't help now. Don't get me wrong, the dips are still similar, they just happen out of sync, but look at yesterday and how $AMC climbed all day, but $GME didn't really run up until power hour.

The future of digital asset liquidity: Centralized or decentralized?,https://www.reddit.com/r/stackatoshi/comments/nnkf8d/the_future_of_digital_asset_liquidity_centralized/,Meneer_Groot,1,2021-05-29 18:13:58,2,/r/stackatoshi/comments/nnkf8d/the_future_of_digital_asset_liquidity_centralized/,NaN,"Last month, Bitcoin ([BTC](https://stackatoshi.com/tag/bitcoin/)) reached above $60,000, highlighting the  current frenzy around digital currencies. Following BTC, altcoins also  saw substantial increases in value. All of this is music to the ears of  long-term and short-term bull investors seeking increased gains, even  with the current pullback and support of Bitcoin hovering around  $40,000.¬†

However, despite all the hype around the current bull  run, a lack of digital asset liquidity continues to be a significant  challenge for exchanges, traders, token issuers and market makers. The  reality of today‚Äôs market is that professional crypto traders cannot  efficiently access global liquidity or find the best global prices to  increase profits. 

For token issuers, the current climate has  forced them to list their coins on numerous exchanges to reach their  target client base. It drives up business development costs and forces  issuers into niche markets. In order for the digital currency market to  continue moving forward, these categories must be understood. 

## Fragmentation and market forces

One  of the main causes of illiquidity is rooted in market fragmentation.  The idea behind crypto is much more than a sexy stock investment. Crypto  is meant to be an entirely new way of handling money. But with all of  the different coins ‚Äî even the successful ones ‚Äî and the lack of  businesses accepting crypto payment, users aren‚Äôt utilizing crypto in  the way it was initially intended.

Of  course, this was the inevitable result of the disruption of the fiat  world. Fragmentation of this type is the only possible path for  consumers to transition into the crypto world. And because exchanges are  generally localized, they tend to service only one or a few fiat  currencies. Again, consumers are left with a fragmented market and a  slow adoption curve.

This situation isn‚Äôt bad, as users have free choice, but it does have consequences.

Two  of those consequences are a dearth of liquidity and highly volatile  prices. Consider how much the price of Bitcoin has changed over the last  two years. It‚Äôs been a roller coaster ride, to say the least. That  volatility makes it tough for a consumer to go on a $500 shopping spree  using a mobile digital wallet at a progressive and technologically adept  department store. In short, liquidation and price movements become a  problem.

What‚Äôs more, the fragmentation of the marketplace has  left newcomers to the space with a massive learning curve. Understanding  the market and determining accurate pricing for various coins requires  having many exchange accounts and a deep awareness of the sector. For  this reason, many newer digital investors simply buy and hold,  anticipating changes in the market but hoping for relatively rapid  returns on coins ‚Äî even those without clear use cases. 

## Centralize the demons?

The  complexities of the fragmented market have forced several different  solutions. Some suggest centralized approaches to liquidity. By  centralizing coins and standardizing markets, investors no longer face a  fractured and complex maze of coins and prices. Without such negative  fragmentation issues at play, investors would be more willing to trade  with rapidity rather than holding for wider bid-ask margins.

While  this seems coherent at first glance, such a solution is untenable.  First, centralization goes against the very ethos on which  cryptocurrencies were developed. Centralization is not the answer to  fixing a market that grew on the back of a conscious rejection of  centralized currencies. To do so would alienate much of the market  itself. 

Second, if the market adopts a centralized policy, the  same problems that plague banks (slow processing times, lack of  transparency and security, high fees) will eventually come to the  digital currency market. The progress once hoped for would only be a  replication of the current financial system‚Äôs failures.

Finally,  even in an apparently decentralized system where all market liquidity is  actually centralized into a few decentralized exchanges, investors  would still be limited in how they could participate. With fewer but  larger pools of liquidity available, the inevitable result is a return  to a fiat-style financial system.

## Distributed solutions 

Because  centralized solutions run contrary to the very nature of digital  currencies, a more robust decentralized solution is needed to mend the  problems caused by market fragmentation. Decentralization, while a  longer-term solution to the problem, can provide the market with  continued adoption by institutions. This trajectory aligns with the  vision of cryptocurrencies while eventually producing stability. 

However,  simple decentralization is not a strong enough answer. For crypto, the  key to liquidity is ‚Äúdistributed, yet connected.‚Äù This slogan takes the  best of both worlds and marries them together. Decentralization ‚Äî that  is, distribution ‚Äî is what makes crypto so revolutionary. But the 21st  century is more globally connected than ever before, a link that will  only grow stronger. 

This growth in connectivity, however, must be  maintained through organic methodologies. To seek to force some staunch  structure onto the cryptocurrency space is, of course, to centralize  it. Therefore, investors and traders must weather the storm of  fragmentation to protect what makes cryptocurrency so profoundly  disruptive. This pathway offers connectivity, and when connectivity  increases, the digital currency market becomes more liquid. Plus, the  more distributed the market remains, the more the original purpose of  digital currencies remains intact. The market must move in this  direction in the next three to five years. 

## Growth toward DeFi

As  the cryptocurrency market moves that way, activity will only continue  to increase, allowing decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions to take  over from there. DeFi solutions offer the best of both worlds: a truly  distributed connectedness, which will protect the digital currency space  and reduce fragmentation of the market.

Most cryptocurrency  trading companies work the same way as a bank or stock exchange, where  buyers and sellers must pay fees for usage. Such a practice can quickly  turn into a David and Goliath situation, where traders are taken  advantage of by Goliaths with more wealth and higher risk thresholds.  However, in a DeFi trading pool, the benefits (and the costs) are spread  evenly among all parties. For contributing to the pool, liquidity  providers get rewarded with a pool token. Buyers always have a seller,  and sellers always have a buyer. 

Moreover, all the liquidity  providers receive a share of the trading fees based upon their stake  size. Truly, this is a decentralized system: Not only can someone offer  crypto to the DeFi pool, but they can also contribute fiat, providing an  avenue for traditional, conservative investors to play a role. If an  investment group sees the benefit, count on them being there for the  reward.

Among the major catalysts that will move the market in  this direction, the most prominent are central bank digital currencies  (CBDCs). As governments begin issuing CBDCs, they offer a far simpler  entry point into DeFi. Investors and consumers alike would already be  prepared for digital transactions, and the barrier for transitioning  funds from fiat to crypto would be substantially lessened. 

Additionally,  CBDCs would allow for a more significant international movement of  funds. Providing a helpful catalyst toward a fully decentralized  liquidity pool would make isolated exchanges transacting only in local  fiat obsolete. Forces like CBDCs and increased DeFi participation will  drive change, and investors will be the better for it.

Hope everyone's fine :) I would like some advice on two things.

**Firstly**

I've studied Biomedical Sciences and Neuroscience and I ended up switching to Software development as the abundance and variety of this profession is always within reach.  Ideally combining the  two disciplines would be awesome but I do understand that it's a difficult thing. I'm aware that professions such as software development for medical devices or biotech companies do exists I fail to find them in abundance (compare to software development roles in finance). My first question would be what other professions utilizing both disciplines exists  ? Something that I could broaden my search.

**Secondly**

I do understand that the above scenario may not always be viable therefore my second question focuses more on software development, a profession that I have working experience. Software development has its perks and there's always a learning curve. But sometimes I catch myself getting frustrated because of the many hours spent in-front of a screen or the the minimum amount of time I spent interacting with people. Therefore my second question would be what other profession within the software development industry or IT in general would a person like be able to do that could combine both the technical aspect and the more interactive one ? 

P.S.1: I don't have a degree in software development , I just have a course diploma and working experience.

Thank you :)"

Get Matic onto Matic Network. I like transferring USDC from Binance to my BSC Metamask, then bridging to Matic Network using EvoDefi ([https://evodefi.com/bridge?token=USDC](https://evodefi.com/bridge?token=USDC)). Flat fee of 0.8 USDC to go from Binance to BSC, and then 0.5% fee to go from BSC to Polygon using EvoDefi bridge. Other people like Transak, or using the Eth bridge, but these are too expensive for me.
2. If you are bullish, use Quickswap ([https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap)) to swap your USDC for Matic, then deposit your Matic onto Aave Polygon ([https://app.aave.com/deposit](https://app.aave.com/deposit)). Then use your available borrowing power to borrow as much Matic as you can, then deposit your borrowed Matic. Rinse and repeat until you are out of borrowing power. Periodically check the rates to ensure that the APR reward you earn from your borrowed Matic is greater than the borrow APY. There is no risk to borrowing Matic as you will always have enough to pay back the amount you borrowed since the Matic rewards you earn are greater than the amount of Matic you have to pay for borrowing.
3. If you are bearish, deposit your USDC onto Curve Finance ([https://polygon.curve.fi/](https://polygon.curve.fi/pools?see=0x272e8d4e1f2d7f905be62cf951891a9cac006cda)) to earn APY on your USDC and wMatic rewards.

NOTE: Do NOT deposit the max amount of Matic you have onto Aave, as you need some leftover to pay gas fees, I would leave at least 1 Matic in your wallet, this will pay for \~1000 transactions. If you make the mistake of depositing the max amount of Matic, use [https://matic.supply/](https://matic.supply/) to collect a small amount of free Matic sufficient to pay the gas fee, also consider donating to their website to help others. 

The Aave Polygon rewards program is set to continue until April 2022, but wMatic rewards will decrease by a considerable amount on June 14th. This is because 0.5% of the total Matic supply is being distributed through Aave between April-June 2021, and another 0.5% is distributed between June 2021 and April 2022. I cannot find a date for when the Curve Finance rewards program will end, I'm guessing it will be when the Matic allocated to Curve Fi by the Polygon team runs out."
DeFi bucks crypto market correction as Uniswap v3 leads the charge,https://www.reddit.com/r/stackatoshi/comments/nns1qg/defi_bucks_crypto_market_correction_as_uniswap_v3/,Meneer_Groot,1,2021-05-30 01:21:47,0,/r/stackatoshi/comments/nns1qg/defi_bucks_crypto_market_correction_as_uniswap_v3/,NaN,"**Decentralized exchange Uniswap successfully launched version 3 of its platform in May ‚Äî resulting in high trade volumes despite a downturn across the cryptocurrency markets.**

The latest version of the hugely popular decentralized finance (DeFi) automated market maker (AMM) has quickly attracted a sizable amount of trade volume, seeing it move into the top five decentralized exchanges alongside Sushiswap, PancakeSwap v2 and its predecessor, Uniswap v2.

The success of v3 cannot be understated, as the cryptocurrency space has been under pressure due to a market correction in May that has cast shadows over what has been the most prolific bull run that the space has seen.

Uniswap v3 is now the leading dex in terms of trading volume, recording an average of $1.2 billion in daily transaction volume, while Uniswap v2, which was leading until very recently, currently processes just under $1 billion in 24-hour transaction value.

Furthermore, a number of fellow DeFi tokens led a rally in the markets after last week‚Äôs tumultuous correction, which has since been dubbed the biggest capitulation in the cryptocurrency markets. However, the overall market saw a $400 billion increase in value shortly after as several altcoins surged, with Maker‚Äôs MKR token gaining 91% and Yearn.finance‚Äôs YFI seeing a 72% increase. The native token of the Uniswap exchange, UNI, and AAVE also saw significant increases in value.

As a result, some analysts believe that Uniswap v3 could see increased use by liquidity providers and retail users given its improved functionality. But what changed, and is it ready to replace the previous version?

## Uniswap v3 revisited

The nature of software development means that applications and platforms are in a constant state of improvement, and Uniswap is no exception. The first version of the booming DeFi AMM was released back in 2018 and has garnered thousands of users and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of transaction volume in the three years since.

Given the nascent state of the DeFi ecosystem, changes come quick and fast, and developers are constantly looking to improve current protocols and offer new products and services on their platforms.

Uniswap v2 was launched in May 2020 and introduced direct token swaps and other features that improved the overall performance of the AMM. In the year since, Uniswap has facilitated around $135 billion in trading volume and has established itself as one of the biggest cryptocurrency spot exchanges worldwide.

While the platform continued to contribute significantly to the popularity and use of DeFi, developers began work on Uniswap v3 behind the scenes, introducing improved control for liquidity providers on the platform and multiple fee tiers.

## V3 is a success?

Uniswap v3‚Äôs launch in May has been heralded as a success, with the trading volume on the platform racking up some eye-popping numbers despite its inferior total value locked (TVL) compared with Uniswap v2.

Johannes Jensen, product and project manager at eToro, told Cointelegraph that the improvements made to critical issues existing in the designs of constant function market makers (CFMMs) have been a key driver in the immediate success of Uniswap v3:

&gt;‚ÄúThe primary contribution is the ability for liquidity providers (LPs) to offer bounded liquidity in a certain price range. With the custom liquidity provision feature, trading fees are collected and held separately, rather than automatically reinvested as liquidity in the pool. An interesting consequence of bounded liquidity positions is that the systemic implications of LP shares are inherently mitigated.‚Äù

Jensen noted that Uniswap‚Äôs v2 model essentially gave liquidity providers proportional ownership of a liquidity pool, which created a complex payout function due to impermanent losses, making the feature more similar to an options contract than a direct claim to the underlying asset.

Elias Simos, protocol specialist at Bison Trails, believes that the early success of Uniswap v3 and its innovations will continue to attract capital from liquidity providers given its improved efficiency:

&gt;‚ÄúWith Uniswap V3, we are seeing the emergence of capital-efficient DeFi. For reference, since its launch in early May, Uniswap V3 has ended up printing something like 120% TVL utilization vs Sushi trading at 20%.‚Äù

Aniket Jindal, co-founder of transaction infrastructure firm Biconomy, highlighted the fact that despite high fees, Uniswap v3 has attracted new users, which suggests that the improvements brought by the latest version of the AMM have been met positively: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs even more surprising is even after gas prices went up to insane levels, Layer 2 DEXs became more popular.‚Äù

## Liquidity providers chase improved returns

The cryptocurrency ecosystem has become accustomed to things moving at breakneck speed, and the prospect of bigger, better returns could well be the catalyst to drive more liquidity providers to Uniswap v3.

Simos believes that the inherent complexities of moving across to v3 will be a short-term barrier to entry, but the bottom line, better yields and new products will drive the migration to the newest version of the AMM:

&gt;‚ÄúYes, concentrated liquidity provides new challenges, perhaps even more overhead for LPs, but firstly the yield is better, and secondly there will soon be an ecosystem of products around Uniswap V3 LP positions that will abstract some of the complexity away.‚Äù

While Jindal agreed with Simos‚Äô sentiments that v3 could continue to attract liquidity providers, there are some factors that might create some friction in the migration of users from v2 who will have to reapprove their tokens for v3 and also for ‚Äúliquidity providers who now need to select a ‚Äòprice range‚Äô which can be complicated for many to understand.‚Äù

Jensen believes that the increased capital efficiency of the Uniswap v3 model will continue attracting new liquidity providers and traders: ‚ÄúThe ability to provide bounded liquidity for a desirable price-range becomes an interesting tool in volatile markets, as LPs can use the model to price the inventory risk of holding less-known or volatile assets.‚Äù

***Related: Uniswap v3 hopes to reinvent its DEX, others see a different path for DeFi***

As a consequence, Jensen suggested that liquidity providers using specialized CFMMs like Curve might migrate to Uniswap v3, depending on the relative depth of stablecoin pairs and trading activity in competing pools. He also added that some might not necessarily want to deal with the added demand of managing their risk:

&gt;‚ÄúMaintaining a consistent income during volatile markets with Uniswap V3 will require an active effort from LPs, as they will need to adjust their pricing ranges accordingly. Decidedly passive LPs may opt for lower capital efficiency to reduce the chance of suffering impermanent losses in highly volatile markets.‚Äù

## DeFi powers the comeback

2021 has proven to be another monumental year for the cryptocurrency space, with major moves happening across the ecosystem. DeFi has become a major focal point, and the most recent market correction has added credence to DeFi‚Äôs influence and role.

Nevertheless, Simos highlighted the fact that DeFi has seen prolific growth since the beginning of 2020 and that important data shows that: ‚ÄúDeFi has been printing positive signs for over 1.5 years right now. The growth in fundamentals (TVL, volumes, users) continues to be on a hockey stick trajectory. \[...\] Will there be short-term volatility? For sure. But the fundamentals persist.‚Äù

Jensen pointed to the role that DeFi and AMMs are playing in capital allocation from liquidity providers and their general use by everyday cryptocurrency users, so much so that they have ‚Äúincreasingly become an intrinsic part of how capital is allocated in crypto today.‚Äù

He also highlighted the yin-and-yang relationship of DeFi and Ethereum, with the latter still the smart contract blockchain of choice for the space. This has inevitably led to problems around high fees, but Jensen believes v3 could help alleviate some of these pain points while Ethereum continues its evolution toward a proof-of-stake future:

&gt;‚ÄúUniswap V3 may attract a more sophisticated breed of LPs which will build new features for algorithmically adjusting price-ranges based on market volatility or even sentiment data.‚Äù"
The Haint Rock,https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckeryUniveristy/comments/no2gd8/the_haint_rock/,itsallalittleblurry,1,2021-05-30 11:24:18,26,/r/FuckeryUniveristy/comments/no2gd8/the_haint_rock/,Fuckery,"Everyone called it the ‚Äúhaint‚Äù rock.  In the dialect of the Mountain People, my people, it was how it em was pronounced.  Folks seemed to have trouble with many rounded vowel sounds, and tended to flatten them out, lending a certain peculiarity to the manner of their speech, which, with the slow, drawling, sometimes twangy accent that was produced by that and other factors, made it its own separate thing.  Not unlike other Southern dialects in some respects, but at the same time unique to the region, and not quite like any other.  The people there speak as they view and live life - in no particular hurry.  Viewing each day as its own separate thing, rather than just a part of days past and yet to come.  Past was past was past, and tomorrow would arrive in its own good time.  The now was today.  Life was something to be lived, rather than be rushed through unnoticed.  A calmer way of living, as old as the ancient green mountains that had bred it.  More introspective and thoughtful.  Folks there were and are quiet by nature.  They generally don‚Äôt say much unless they have something meaningful to say.  Which means they tend to Listen to and understand each other.  Closer to the Earth are they, and respectful of Her ways and moods and seasons.  They till her rich dark soil with their hands to bring forth her abundance - her gifts.  And they do it with respect.  They honor still, in their long traditions brought with them from distant lands across the Sea by their forebears, the old ways, even as they embrace the new.  They roam the hills and valleys, and the shaded hollows.  They feel her bones beneath their feet.  In the sighing of the wind they hear her breath.  In the Sind of countless treats and rivulets the hear her blood flowing through the veins that are their courses.  And under it all, they feel and hear the beating of her heart, for it‚Äôs the same heart that beats in them all.  If the Earth they are a part.  They feel unseen all around them the presence of the ancient spirits that roam those ancient hills that are among the oldest on Earth, beings who are more ancient still.  But without fear, for they are one with them, also.  And so they do not fear the coming of the night in the wild and empty spaces they call Home. Fold there still plant and harvest according to the phases of the moon.

And ‚Äúhaint‚Äù, in the particular dialect of those People (My People), is just their pronunciation of ‚Äúhaunt‚Äù.  Meaning, to them, an incorporeal being of the spirit world, as others would say ‚Äúghost‚Äù or ‚Äúspirit‚Äù - a noun rather than a verb.

So, the Haint Rock (for that was the name given it in a time no one now remembers; or Ghost Rock; or Spirit Rock - all one and the same.  

A massive Boulder of incalculable weight tumbled down from a greater height in a different time, when the world was younger and the brooding mountains in their green mantle were taller.  Come to rest in the place where it still towering lies in a time before the first men ventured into the shadowed places of what was then an unnamed, untamed wilderness of mountain, stream, and stone.  

In its fissures and hollow passages delving back into darkness, and away from the light, it is believed to be a dwelling place of spirits that roam the hills and valleys, as they always have.  A lodestone that draws them.  So respect is given.  None venture to enter into its dark recesses.  One does not enter another‚Äôs home uninvited.  

It is a place and thing apart.  That spot produces a feeling of uneasiness in those who have need or reason to pass it by; a troubling of the mind.  They do not linger. 

Gram would have occasion to bypass it from time to time, for it was near to where they lived.

Gram‚Äôs youngest Son, and the youngest of all her children, save for my Mother, built, when he was in his early teens, a small log cabin nearly in the shadow of the rock.  So, perhaps, he was drawn to it, too.  

A place of his own, where he could find a personal solitude, and where he would sometimes live and sleep on his own for days at a time.  

A small, rough dwelling, not much more than a hut, in which he could be at peace.  That he had insisted he build with his own two hands, though not much more than a child.  And he built it well.  It would remain long after he was gone, as it slowly settled back into the earth from which it came, as had he.

On a flat, shaded space among young trees, bounded on three sides by running water; a broad curve of a stream.  

I called him Gram‚Äôs Son, for that was who and what he was.  Her Baby.  His Brothers, men already grown, and not long returned from war, were rough, hardy men, sometimes prone to violence and anger.  They were their Father‚Äôs Sons.  But he, a late child like my Mother, and of gentler nature, was Hers.  Though she would laughingly tell me, many long years later, with a wistful smile of fond remembrance, and a hint of hurt still in her dark eyes that spoke of old pain now gentled with time, he was more stubborn than all the rest put together.  

He was killed when he was sixteen years old.  An accident, in which none were to blame, save perhaps he himself.

He had planned to, as David Crockett once declared, ‚Äúgo to Texas‚Äù as soon as he was able.  He longed to leave his mountain home for that far country‚Äôs wild, wide-open spaces.  He longed to be a cowboy, in the truest traditional sense of the word.  

He had been preparing for years, equipping himself as he saw need in his idealized version of that life, and setting hard-earned money aside to finance his venture.  Gleaned from willing labor at whatever work he could find.

The guitar that he had bought himself and taught himself to play, was gifted to my Mother, his younger Sister, who had been his favorite, as she had loved him unconditionally in return.  She would keep it all her life.  Now in her eighties, with children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of her own, she has it still.  She still remembers.

Gramp long kept his saddle and his tack in their own space in the barn.  He would keep all cared-for, and well-oiled, so that the passing of time would not cause the leather to dry and crack.

Gram kept his white hat with its high, rounded crown and the wide brim that was to have protected him from the hot Texas sun.  On top of a wooden wardrobe, where she could see it as she passed by.  

In a small tin box she stored the blood-stained dollar that had been tucked into a shirt pocket.  She showed it to me a few times as a boy, and would tell me all about him.  Her way of keeping his memory alive, and of passing it on.

She would let me hold it once or twice.  As I would, in wonder, run my fingers over the old dark stains upon it, I realized even then how precious it was to her - a literal part of him that was with her still.

Gram would pass often, in the weeks and months that followed his sudden departure, by the tiny cabin that sat near the brooding rock.  

Each time it would be the same.  As she would pass by the small structure that had been his home away from home, that sat now empty among its shading trees, he would fall into step beside her as she walked.  ‚ÄúAs close‚Äù she would tell me, all those long years later ‚Äúas you are to me now.  I couldn‚Äôt see him, but I could Feel him there beside me.‚Äù

And she would hear his voice, as he walked unseen beside her, ‚Äúas clear‚Äù as she again would say ‚Äúas I‚Äôm talkin‚Äô to you now‚Äù.

And each time the question, and the question was always the same, in the beloved voice that she remembered so well:
‚ÄúWher‚Äô you goin‚Äô, Momma?  Momma, tell me wher‚Äô you goin?‚Äù

But she would never answer, fearing somehow that if she ever to speak or answer, it would break the spell, and, his curiosity satisfied, he would go away, and she would feel his presence and hear his voice no more.

But he would not approach the rock, almost as if he feared it.  As she neared it, she would begin to feel his presence slip away.  As she passed its dark, brooding bulk, she would realize that he was no longer beside her.  She found reason or excuse to pass that way often in the weeks and months that followed his death.  She would often slow her pace, and sometimes linger for a while, basking in his unseen presence, and the slight temporary easing of her grief, ignoring the eternal question that she so feared to answer.

And then a day came when he did not fall into step beside her as he had always done, and she knew without knowing how she knew that she would never hear his voice again.

So, was it a nearly broken woman‚Äôs imaginings in a time of great sorrow?  A conjuring of her mind to gain some small respite from a grief still fresh and raw?  Or was it something more?

For she was a daughter of the Earth, in tune with its ancient rhythms, as women have always been, and some more than others.

She would often be forewarned of the approaching death of someone that she knew or loved by a rapping in the darkest hours of the night upon the wooden headboard of her bed.  A foreknowledge that had been burden and sorrow to her, and that she did not welcome.  But over the years, she had never been wrong once."

"I am 24 years old, make $92,000, live in PA and work as a BI analyst",https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/nobcs7/i_am_24_years_old_make_92000_live_in_pa_and_work/,icyriver533,1,2021-05-30 21:35:59,33,/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/nobcs7/i_am_24_years_old_make_92000_live_in_pa_and_work/,Money Diary," A week in which I mostly study for my CFA L3 exam and think mostly about food/cooking.

**Note:** I am married but (mostly) keep my finances independently from M, my husband. We provide full financial support for several people in M‚Äôs family, and the whole situation stresses me out, so we opted to use his salary for their finances (about $27k per year after tax) and my salary for our finances. We hope to have the situation resolved in the next year or two, at which time we will fully combine finances.

**Section One: Assets and Debt** \- rounded to the nearest hundred

**Retirement Balance (and how you got there):**

* **Current 401k:** $25,700 including a 6% match from my employer. I currently contribute 11% pretax and 6% after tax.
* **Roth IRA:** $38,900. My parents gave me $5k as a graduation present, which went into this account as a prior tax year, and I put in 3 years of maxing out my contributions. Unfortunately I am no longer eligible to contribute to this account.
* **Previous 401k:** $18,000. All employee contributions. Did not receive a match and instead received:
* **Employer stock from previous job:** $9,900 vested, $15,200 total. It is illiquid and valued twice per year. Administratively it is a disaster, so I consider it ‚Äònice to have but not counting on it‚Äô. I need to take care of rolling this out (if possible) and hope to get a better handle on it this year.

**Equity if you're a homeowner** maybe $60k based on home prices near me? I put down $32k three years ago, which I had mostly saved up over years of working, plus my dad sold shares of Amazon that I had ‚Äúpurchased‚Äù with my allowance as a kid, and he sent me $9k of proceeds. Prior to this, M and I rented a fully furnished dump in a bad neighborhood for $200/mo including all utilities. We also lived on a very tight budget of about $700/mo for everything else (food, car, etc.). It was great for saving up but I‚Äôm so glad to be past that! 

**Savings account balance:** $69,600, $30k of which is an emergency fund. This total amount of cash is much too high for our needs (and M has another $40k in his own account), but we would like to contribute to and/or fully cover the college education of a family member whom we are currently sending to a private high school for about $2k a year with financial aid. She is not sure if she wants to go to college, but we will know for sure in the next year, at which point we will determine if we have excess cash to DCA into a brokerage account. 

**Checking account balance:** $13,800. This is my ‚Äòprimary‚Äô account and everything gets funneled through here. About $1,200 in bills about to come out for this month including paying off my credit card, electric, internet, etc.

**Credit card debt (and how you accumulated it):** $0, I put everything on credit for cash back but pay it off each month.

**Student loan debt (for what degree):** $0, I was lucky enough to attend the college where my dad is a professor, so tuition was free, and room and board was covered by a research position. My degree is economics/finance and English but I bopped around computer science, art, and math as well. I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have had this start in life, which is why I really want to encourage/support the younger members of M‚Äôs family (and eventually my kids) to do the same. I am currently studying to take my Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Level III exam, which has all been covered by my previous employer. 

**Section Two: Income**

**Income Progression:** I've been working in my field (sort of) for 4 years, my starting salary was $50,000

**Age 15:** worked minimum wage as a grocery store cashier

**Age 16:** dropped out of high school and took community college classes. I was fortunate enough to live at home and did not work during this time. 

**Age 17:** Transferred to a four year college where my dad worked = free tuition. Obtained a research position paying $8.50/hr for 38 hours per week plus room and board. I also picked up a tutoring job in computer science for minimum wage for a few hours per week. 

**Age 18:** Added an additional tutoring job in English for $250/month and picked up another internship doing marketing/design for $12.50/hr, 10-20 hours per week. 

**Age 19:** Took a summer internship in NYC for $20/hour and lived with my aunt. Decided the NYC finance life was NOT for me, but I‚Äôm so glad I figured that out sooner rather than later. I dropped the local internship after that summer, and for my final semester at school, I only had tutoring work, which was a cut in money but much less stress. I stopped living on campus and moved into an apartment with M, where we would live for the next 2 years.

**Age 20:** Graduated college (and got my GED!) and started my first job in financial services a week later as an analyst at $50,000. Bonus that year was $6,000, partly to make up for the fact that I was too young to be eligible for any benefits. 

**Age 21:** $52,000 per year plus $12,000 bonus at the end of the year. Finally eligible for retirement and health benefits, neither of which were very good.

**Age 22:** $56,000 per year plus $20,000 bonus at the end of the year.

**Age 23:** Got sick of my job‚Äôs culture and found a new job as a BI analyst with a focus on finance/accounting. Salary was $90,000 with a $2,000 bonus at the end of the year. 

**Age 24:** Current salary is just under $92k based on country-wide raises. Bonus is determined by company performance at the end of the fiscal year, so I don‚Äôt know what my bonus will be. I am hoping to move into a corporate finance position (with the same company) in the next year or so, which is more up my alley than my current IT-heavy job. 

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:**

$3,995.28

* Taxes: $1,614.40
* Insurance: $280.14. 
* Retirement contributions: $780.58 pre tax, $425.76 after tax = total $1,206.34

**Side Gig Monthly Take Home**

$0

**Any Other Monthly Income Here**

Essentially $0, though we get a little bit of interest from our savings accounts and my in-laws occasionally will send large gifts since I do their cleaning every week. 

**Section Three: Expenses**

**Rent / Mortgage / HOA fees:** $1,030.40

* Mortgage: $524.25
* Taxes: $216.15
* HOA: $290 aka the bane of my existence

**Renters / home insurance** $16

**Retirement contribution** $0

**Savings contribution** This is mostly a fallout number and I consider remaining extra cash as saving for aforementioned college tuition. Overall I‚Äôm not very deliberate about it.

**Investment contribution** nothing additional at this time! We are stockpiling cash but hopefully that will change soon.

**Debt payments** $251/month on my 2017 Toyota Yaris iA. I will finish paying it off in March of next year.

**Donations (please specify if monthly or annual).** 

This is kind of a fluctuating number. I was a bit all over the place last year, but the total giving came out to about $6k to various charities and ministries. I also ‚Äúgift‚Äù another \~$5k per year to family members that need the money, which I don‚Äôt consider a donation in the true sense. I would like to cease family member gifts next year, except for $100/mo to M‚Äôs aunt and any college tuition that we ultimately provide.

**Electric:** \~$80/month but seems to be increasing lately

**Wifi/Cable/Landline:** $53/month 

**Cellphone:** technically $0 but I‚Äôm on M's plan for $15/mo

**Subscriptions:** $0 (but my husband has HBO Max and Amazon Prime for the family, which we use, and my parents let me use their Netflix but we rarely do)

**Gym membership:** $5 Patreon subscription

**Pet expenses:** $0, no pets allowed by our HOA :(

**Car payment / insurance:** Payment for the loan (above) and $67/mo on insurance

**Regular therapy:** $0

**Paid hobbies:** $0

**Any other expense that's relevant to you:** I allocate $100/mo for ‚Äúfun,‚Äù which usually goes towards stationery, purses, DVDs, or something of a frivolous nature like that! I also love food and cooking, so I budget $400/mo on groceries, which I consider both a necessity/fun all in one. 

**Day 1 (Sunday)**

**10 AM:** I‚Äôm feeling a little sick after my second Covid shot, so I don‚Äôt get up until late. I head outside to read the Bible for the next two hours. Eventually I‚Äôll need to find a church to go to, but I haven‚Äôt devoted enough time to finding one yet.

**12 PM:** I start half a CFA practice test and finish up around 2. I make club sandwiches for a late lunch for M and me; I don‚Äôt know why it took me this long to try putting bacon on homemade sandwiches, but it‚Äôs delicious. Then I head back to studying again.

**7 PM:** I ship out a couple of promotional CDs for M (who just released a new album) which costs 14.45 for shipping, and I update our records on sales, expenses, etc. I activate a ‚Äúbeacon‚Äù for my new State Farm car insurance, but I don‚Äôt know how I feel about my car being tracked all the time. I kind of feel like my privacy is being invaded, even though it‚Äôs just tracking my driving. Then I cook up some potstickers for supper that I stashed in the freezer months ago, and we watch Andy Griffith. I end up falling asleep around 9, get up to wash up around 12, and properly go to bed.

**Daily spending - Other: $14.45**

**Day 2 (Monday)**

**7 AM:** I get ready for work and meanwhile write out a check for a doctor visit M had a few weeks ago for $56.13 and get that into the mail. I also cash a check that I received as a return on home insurance premium for $12.77. I poke my head outside hoping to work on our back deck today, but it‚Äôs rainy and chilly.

**8 AM:** I settle in for work. My job is very quiet right now because I had a few big projects that fell through, so I‚Äôm down to one big project and two projects on hold. I think my manager also has been avoiding giving me more work until after my CFA exam is done, which I appreciate.

**9 AM:** I text a friend who passed the CFA L3 exam two years ago to see what his mock exam scores were like that year. He said around 80-85, which is quite a bit higher than my 70ish scores. Boo.

**12 PM:** I heat up burritos for lunch that I had frozen a few weeks ago. I also defrost some chicken breast that I had frozen, and then I study through my lunch break.

**5 PM:** I finish up working a little early. I poach and shred two of the defrosted chicken breasts to make quesadillas tomorrow. For tonight, I make chicken francese and a Caesar salad. I have a little bit of leftover homemade anchovy-Caesar dressing, so that makes it a ‚Äòfancy‚Äô meal. We watch an episode of Star Trek (the original series).

**7 PM:** I settle in for more studying until about midnight, at which time I head to bed.

**Daily spending - Home + Health:** **$43.36**

**Day 3 (Tuesday)**

**7 AM:** I start work and find my manager has cancelled all of my meetings with him for this week so that I can study during the work day. He‚Äôs one of the reasons I am somewhat reluctant to move into another department even though I don‚Äôt love the work I do.

**9 AM:** I get on a conference call with some folks in South America to talk about a profitability model I‚Äôve been working on for months. I find out I pretty much have to start over, which is kind of a bummer, but it‚Äôll definitely be a better long-term solution now. 

**12 PM:** I eat leftovers from the birthday dinner I cooked for M over the weekend: rack of lamb, shaved brussel sprouts, duchess potatoes, and watercress soup. Working from home has its perks! M doesn‚Äôt go for leftovers much so I get all the good stuff. I also call a local seafood restaurant for a reservation on Friday for my father-in-law‚Äôs birthday.

**5 PM:** I use the shredded chicken from yesterday to make chicken quesadillas. I throw some vegetables into the quesadillas, but overall it‚Äôs not shaping up to be a healthy food week! We put on an episode of Columbo for background noise, which we end up leaving on repeat for the rest of the night.

**7 PM:** I fall asleep again after supper, probably a residual effect of staying up until 3 for most of the last month. M wakes me up at 9:30 to start studying, which I do until 3. During my study breaks, I place an order through Express Scripts for a prescription ($10). I find out another prescription has been sent to the wrong pharmacy, which I will need to take care of tomorrow. 

**Daily spending - Home + Health:** **$10.00**

**Day 4 (Wednesday)**

**8AM-5PM:** Not much to report. I‚Äôm pretty much a useless bum for the whole day; I keep cycling between wanting to cram for the test and just wanting to have it done and out of my hands.

**5 PM:** We eat leftover chicken francese and I study a little. I get my things together and I‚Äôm ready for bed around 10.

**Daily spending - $0**

**Day 5 (Thursday)**

**6 AM:** The big day! Test is at 8. I do some last minute cramming, arrive at the test center at 7:30, and take my test. It doesn‚Äôt go terribly - I know all of the information on the test, but there seem to be kinks in the software and answer system because it‚Äôs the first time this test has been on the computer. The test is essentially graded on a curve, so I‚Äôm hopeful that collectively the minimum passing score will just be lower this year.

**2 PM:** I get home and am not really sure what to do with myself! M has a bottle of champagne ready for me. I end up reading five issues of Swamp Thing, and M orders me sushi as a surprise. I‚Äôm not sure how much it cost, but he gets some ‚Äòfancy‚Äô rolls instead of my usual salmon, tuna, and yellowtail combination. We watch Kramer vs. Kramer on HBO Max, and then we also watch Witness (one of my favorites) on DVD. It‚Äôs a comfortable night in while I shake off the residual ‚ÄòI need to be studying‚Äô feelings that I usually have for a week or so after the test.

**Daily spending - $0**

**Day 6 (Friday)**

**8 AM:** I‚Äôm only working a half day today so it‚Äôs a pretty light day.

**12 PM:** I head to the grocery store for our weekly supplies and for appetizer makings since we are having my in-laws over for my FIL‚Äôs birthday. I shop at Wegmans and Weis every week, with most of my usual groceries coming from the former and sale items/beef/sandwich meat coming from the latter. Weis is generally more expensive except for beef and weekly sale items, which I check every week. This week‚Äôs meal plan: beef and vegetable shish kebabs, lemon flounder with macaroni and mixed vegetables, salmon teriyaki stir fry, and chicken pot pie. ($81.01 at Wegmans, $40.36 at Weis). The bill is extra high this week because I didn‚Äôt go shopping the week before, but I‚Äôm surprised it isn‚Äôt closer to $150.

**1 PM:** I make an apple pie (my FIL‚Äôs favorite) and cheesecake bars (M and my MIL‚Äôs favorite) for tonight‚Äôs dessert. I also prep ingredients for appetizers: fruit and vegetable tray, bacon cheddar pinwheels, sweet lebanon bologna and cream cheese rollups (it‚Äôs a PA thing), and smoked salmon crostini.

**6 PM:** My in-laws get lost coming to our house (as usual) so we skip the appetizers and head immediately to the restaurant, a local seafood place. The meal isn‚Äôt very good, but at $170 (with tip) it doesn‚Äôt set us back as much as I would have thought. M pays for the meal, as he always does when we go out to eat. We head back to the house for dessert/presents and they stay until about midnight.

**Daily spending - Food + Drink: $121.37**

**Total weekly spending:**

**Food + Drink:** $121.37

**Fun / Entertainment:** $0

**Home + Health:** $53.36

**Clothes + Beauty:** $0

**Transport:** $0

**Other:** $14.45

**Lastly, reflect on your diary!** 

This was a bit of a high stress week, but I am looking forward to some downtime for the next few months (or longer if I pass the test?!) I have a feeling next week will be a high-spend week as I get myself caught up on life again - I want a few kitchen gadgets, M needs new shirts, etc. I tend to have very ‚Äòlumpy‚Äô spending, so this week was about standard spending-wise but does not reflect the occasional week where I do a few hundred dollars of shopping.

In writing the beginning section I have a better sense of why I‚Äôm stressed about money/circumstances even though I feel like I ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt because I‚Äôm making so much.‚Äù We are actively working on weaning other people off of our support and hope to be more firmly established in our own lives! I think we are making good progress all things considered. 

My primary goals are to buy and move into our forever home, start our own family in the next two years, and long-term to be able to retire early. I definitely need to invest more to achieve the latter. But I am overall happy with my own spending/budgeting habits outside of that and definitely appreciated this exercise!"
