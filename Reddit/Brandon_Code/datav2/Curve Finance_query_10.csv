‚û°Ô∏èThe Psychology of Why People Fall for Shills: How to Spot When It's Happening to You &amp; Strategies to Prevent It,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pyp3f7/the_psychology_of_why_people_fall_for_shills_how/,worththefightboxing,1,2021-10-01 01:53:55,4,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pyp3f7/the_psychology_of_why_people_fall_for_shills_how/,CRITICAL-DISCUSSION,"If you are on crypto social media, you are bound to see posts every day warning against shills like Bitboy, the biggest crypto YouTuber who is widely accused of pumping various shitcoins by shilling their 100x potential to his followers, and then dumping his bags on them. (Honestly Bitoldman would be a better nameü§£ but I digress.) Yet many shills have huge followings while the non-shill-y edifying content creators have much smaller followings, which leads us to the question of why people are prone to shilling. 

This same question applies more broadly - why do a long line of people fall for joining MLMs or paying thousands for scammy get-rich-quick courses when a quick search will yield plenty of warnings to the contrary? In some cases, it is simply being a newbie and lacking the knowledge. But in many cases even after people have been warned off of shills or schemes, they actually dismiss the warnings. What psychological forces are at work that lead us to fall for shills and similar scams?

**What are cognitive biases?**

Classical economists assumed that people are rationally self-interested and would always make rational decisions to pursue their interests. It doesn't take much observation of the world to see that that is poor assumption, whether it is people who choose to incur massive student debt to go to a school where few people get jobs to people who vote against their own self interests. Behavioral economists challenged that assumption and began to document cognitive biases, which are systematic irrationalities in judgment and decision-making that impact people generally and lead them to make suboptimal judgments and decisions. (If you're wondering why these cognitive biases exist, the answer is evolutionary psychology. 

These cognitive biases are short cuts or heuristics that allow us to make quick decisions. In some cases, they are ego-driven, which also relates back to evolutionary psychology because ego-protection staves off negative emotions.) I think the answer of why people persist in listening to shills and falling for scammy schemes lies in these cognitive biases and other psychological phenomenon. Check out my other article on crypto trading and cognitive biases to learn more about them. As I was writing this I realize there are actually so many cognitive biases at play that I will have to split this into two articles.

**How do cognitive biases predispose people to fall for shills?**

The first step is to form even a small belief in the possibility that whatever the shill is shilling might be true. Once we have that small belief, that is the fertile ground that allows the other cognitive biases to take hold. Imagine that you're new to crypto and go searching for more information on &lt;shudder&gt; YouTube or Twitter and you encounter a shill. People tend to visualize the positive outcome that the shills promise, such as 1000x return, and researchers have shown that imagining positive outcomes gives you a little rush of dopamine, which feels good and pushes you toward wanting to believe the shill. You may also have a little voice in your head telling you it is too good to be true, but dismissing the person as a shill does not feel nearly so good. Hope is a very dangerous thing. That's what shills, MLMs, some franchises, etc really peddle - the promise and hope of a better life. With that bit of hope and dopamine you begin to form a belief that this shill might be right about whatever he is shilling. You want to believe that.

Once you begin to form that belief, a cascade of cognitive biases can lead to a firmly-held belief in a shill or scammy product or venture. Have you ever tried to talk someone out of something you can clearly see is a ripoff? If so, you have encountered the power of the desire to believe and cognitive biases at work. Of course different people are more and less prone to being impacted by cognitive biases, but you are foolish if you believe that you are above being effected by them. In fact, people who hold that belief tend to actually be more impacted by cognitive biases (as do smart people - they trust their own irrational reasoning more). You may not fall for shills but you have definitely fallen prey to cognitive biases. We all have.

**1. Confirmation bias causes people to seek evidence to support their beliefs and not seek, and minimize, evidence contrary to their beliefs.**

First, people are irrationally prone to seeing what they want to see (and, on the flip side, dismissing or explaining away what they don't want to see). We've probably all observed this - it is much easier to see in other people than in ourselves - but researchers have also documented it and given it a name: confirmation bias, i.e., seeking and giving weight to evidence in support of our beliefs and not seeking, and minimizing, evidence that contradicts our beliefs. Once we have even hope that a shill might be telling us about a real opportunity, we start seeking evidence that supports that theory. It is not something that we are generally conscious of, but the next time you find yourself considering an investment opportunity, it might be a good time to ask yourself whether you are equally seeking and evaluating evidence for and against making that investment.

For example, if you are considering investing in a franchise, you will receive what is called a franchise disclosure document (""FDD"") containing certain information the franchisor is required by law to disclose to you, kind of like the offering document accompanying securities investments. Among the materials in the FDD is a list of people (including contact information) who have closed or sold locations of that franchise within the past five years. It would be wise to call these people and ask about their experiences and why they closed. I have done this myself (I ultimately chose not to franchise as further chronicled in this post about franchising versus independent business), and every person I called had never been contacted before even though hundreds of franchises had been sold after they closed. It was even more shocking when the franchisor told us that the vast majority of franchisees asked no questions about the information in the FDD. The franchisor was shocked at the number of questions we were asking. Even we felt the impact of confirmation bias while we considered franchising - we wanted to explain away why so many locations of the franchise were performing poorly. The revenue numbers were right there in black and white (as required to be in the FDD) and they were quite bad and yet we still were considering investing in the franchise. I am talking about franchises but the same thing applies to shilled cryptocurrencies, MLMs, etc. We all want to believe that if we invest in Cardano, it will go up by 1000% and it will make us millionaires. It feels good. With crypto, it isn't just one shill either. It is often many shills which just adds to the weight of the ""evidence"" they are providing.

**2. Overconfidence bias, our tendency to believe that we are the exception to the rule and overestimate our capabilities and underestimate the capabilities of others, leads us to dismiss contrary evidence from others.**

People are generally overconfident. This is etiology of the phenomenon of approximately 95% of people believing they are above average drivers or 80% of people believing they are above average in intelligence (which, in a normally distributed trait, is not possible). Strangely, the less experienced or skilled you are, the more likely you are to overestimate your own capabilities and, conversely, experts overestimate their skills much less since they have a much better handle on what they do and don't know. This is called the Dunning-Krueger effect. People often claim they don't experience this bias but let me ask you to think back to when you started college. Were you expecting to be in the bottom half of the class? Very few people do and yet college does a pretty good job of grouping kids of fairly similar abilities together so how do you really confidently know your performance especially given that your competitors are of similar intelligence and work ethic? Or ask yourself whether you believe you are an above average driver or of above average intelligence? It is likely if you are honest with yourself that you have some overconfidence bias.

The problem with overconfidence is it contributes to people discounting the bad experiences of others and thinking that they are going to be the exception. Many times with crypto shilling the voices of dissenters are drowned our by all the people shilling their bags to unsuspecting newbies. But if you read most shill threads or the comments to shill videos, you will see people warning to not invest. But because of overconfidence bias, it is easy to be overconfident about your chances of success and to dismiss other people's failures as due to their poor capability as to investing (yes, even as to the same investment). If you are motivated to do so, it is easy to explain away the poor outcomes of others and think of reasons why you will still be successful.

**3. People's tendency to avoid cognitive dissonance leads them to rationalize or explain away contradictory evidence.**

Cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort that results from holding two conflicting beliefs at the same time. If people have already begun to want to believe a shill, and confirmation bias and overconfidence have led them to seek supporting evidence and dismiss conflicting evidence, that belief will begin to take hold within them and become associated with their ego. (Yes beliefs become associated with our egos - just think of arguments you have had with people where you clearly have the rationally better side but they stubbornly cling onto their beliefs anyway - or vice versa. That is ego-associated beliefs at work.) Once a belief has been planted in the fertile ground of our minds, and fertilized by association with our ego, being confronted with conflicting information or beliefs results in uncomfortable cognitive dissonance, especially if we have already taken the action of investing in whatever was shilled to us. When people experience cognitive dissonance, they are psychologically motivated to resolve the dissonance and rid themselves of that discomfort. Generally people resolve this discomfort but doubling down on their ego-associated belief and minimizing, rationalizing, or explaining away the ego-deflating belief or evidence. For people who have already ego-associated themselves with whatever idea a shill is pushing, this means that when they encounter evidence or information contrary to that belief and experience cognitive dissonance, they are prone to rationalize or explain away that contrary information to rid themselves of that uncomfortable cognitive dissonance.

**How do you avoid falling for shills?**

The psychological phenomenon laid out in this article explain why people are prone to falling for shills and other similar sketchy ""opportunities"", but there are actually several more cognitive biases that further predispose us to shilling which I will plan to address in a second installment since this article is already quite long. The last thing I would like to quickly address is how to limit the chance that shills will convince you from investing in a useless token. Here are a few recommendations:

*Stick to the following cryptocurrency investment strategy*. If you follow it, there is little possibility of investing in a crappy shilled token since the strategy is very specific about which tokens to buy: Buy some BTC, some ETH, a little of other solid smart contract coins (SOL, AVAX, ALGO, ATOM, DOT, BNB (maybe), and finally buy a little of solid DeFi tokens like CRV, MKR, BAL, etc. 

*Make friends in the cryptocurrency community*. Join the discords and forums of solid protocols like Yearn Finance and Curve Finance and make friends in the crypto community. Consult with your friends before diving in to exotic tokens.

*If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is (although to be fair there is a lot of opportunity in crypto right now that sounds too good to be true but is actually true).*"

Appalled and disgusted by Compound Finance founder threatening to call IRS and DOXX those who got lucky due to the protocols bugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pznjwe/appalled_and_disgusted_by_compound_finance/,DetroitMotorShow,1,2021-10-02 11:32:34,47,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pznjwe/appalled_and_disgusted_by_compound_finance/,FINANCE,"As many have heard, the compound protocol recently faced bugs where few users were given millions worth COMP tokens that shouldn‚Äôt have been issued at all. 

While bugs are a part of crypto protocols,  and there are ways to fix them including printing more tokens, devaluing them and issuing them to others to compensate for the excess issuance, the founder of Compound decided to ask those who received these payouts to give them back, and if they didn‚Äôt, he would report them to IRS and Dox them. üôÑ

It‚Äôs appalling a respected developer of a pioneering protocol would suggest this. 

Wtf is the logic of reporting to IRS? ‚ÄúHey, you got $20m , give it back or I‚Äôll report you to IRS.‚Äù 
‚ÄúNah, IRS can have my tax, I‚Äôll keep my $14m post tax thank you very much Robbie‚Äù

And threatening that everyone is doxxed? Give me a fucking break 

What‚Äôs even more hypocritical from Leshner is that last year, Curve launched as an innovative stablecoin swap but was quickly formed by competitors including one funded by Leshner. While Curve was a no-VC OG project, it now has VC funded teams stealing its code. So the Curve community demanded the devs take legal action against IP theft, as Curve was not on a open source license even though its code was open source. At that time, Leshner made the case that no one from crypto should approach actual real world legal remedies. 

Now when it suits him, he is threatening to call the IRS. Jeez man."

Radix expalined: interview 21 july 2021 CEO Piers Ridyard :

DeFi has grown exceedingly fast ‚Äî and when this happens, it‚Äôs inevitable that teething problems will emerge.

Here, we talk to Piers Ridyard, the CEO of [**Radix**](https://www.radixdlt.com/)**.** He tells us what his company is doing to address some of the main pain points in this sector ‚Äî and the challenges that consumers and developers currently face.

**1. Hello! Can you tell us about Radix?**

Absolutely. Radix is **the first public decentralized network built specifically to serve decentralized finance (DeFi).** This was necessary because **with DeFi on Ethereum, building sucks ‚Äî there have been over $285 million in hacks in the last two years alone.** The networks are slow and inefficient ‚Äî gas fees keep hitting record highs and costing the users millions of dollars, and the growth of the space is being fundamentally held back by network congestion.

We like to say Radix is ‚Äúlayer-one DeFi done right,**‚Äù** this is because Radix is the only decentralized network where developers will be able to build quickly without the constant threat of exploits and hacks, where every improvement will get rewarded, and where scale will never be a bottleneck.

Radix is building three huge improvements to DeFi technology that will be released over the next 3 years:

**1. 10x DeFi developer productivity**. Right now, DeFi developers spend up to 90% of their time securing their code rather than building functionality. Despite that there have still been over $285m of DeFi hacks, bugs and exploits to date on Ethereum.

Solidity (the Ethereum programming language) is a big part of the problem. **Radix is building** a purpose-built DeFi programming environment ""**Scrypto""** that will enable fast AND secure development, giving DeFi developers more time to focus on innovation rather than security.

**Scrypto** is scheduled to be **released in Q4 2021.**

**2. 100x DeFi execution efficiency.** The **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is where all DeFi smart contract logic is executed and it is SLOW.** So slow in fact that it is one of the biggest bottlenecks of DeFi today.

**The Radix Engine** is designed **to change the game** by replacing the EVM **for a lean, mean, state-executing machine.** You can think of it **like upgrading a computer CPU from one built 20 years ago to Apple‚Äôs best new processors. Incredibly fast,** more energy efficient, and able to do a whole heap of stuff in parallel.

**The Radix Engine v1** is released with the first Radix mainnet launch on July 28 2021. 

**The Radix Engine v2  is scheduled to be released in 2022.**

**3. 1000x DeFi scalability.** DeFi on Ethereum is expensive to use. This is because it is not scalable, but popular, which creates a huge amount of congestion. What many underestimate is the sheer magnitude of transactions these systems will have to deal with. **To replace the global financial system will require processing of millions of transactions per second,** which **is well beyond the capabilities of platforms like Ethereum** 2.0 or **Solana,** and also completely beyond the capabilities of layer-two scaling solutions.

Radix built their consensus algorithm, Cerberus, to deliver **something entirely unique to the blockchain industry** ‚Äî linearly scalable atomic composability for DeFi. This means the long term Radix system should not only deliver **millions of transactions per second**, it should do so **in an entirely DeFi native way.**

The fully sharded, linearly scalable version of the Radix public network is scheduled for our Xi‚Äôan release in 2023.

These three foundation pieces of technology deliver our vision of a public permissionless infrastructure for the global financial system to run on.

**2. Is the industry approaching scalability the right way?**

**The industry understands that scalability is a problem, but I think there is a common misunderstanding about how large the problem is.** To illustrate, it is a little bit like trying to work out how scalable the internet needs to be by calculating how many phone calls are done around the world and using that as the approximate amount of data that the internet would need to handle.

The numbers aren‚Äôt even going to be close. But this is the problem, we currently know about phone calls (transactions for finance) in the global financial system, but we have only just started to understand what websites (smart contracts for DeFi) are going to require bandwidth wise.

The 2,000 transactions per second that Visa does is often quoted as the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù for scalability, forgetting that Alipay did [256,000 transactions per second](https://twitter.com/Alipay/status/929123909970153472?s=20) on their busiest days in China, in 2017! And this is just one system. The total financial system today probably averages about 2m transactions per second just ticking over.

Add to this the fact that on DeFi everything is connected. One transaction on Uniswap can set off tens or even hundreds of other smart contract interactions, doing everything from updating oracle prices to running arbitrage bots or yield farming strategies. One transaction in DeFi is not one transaction, one transaction can end up triggering tens or even hundreds of smart contract logic executions.

So, if **the global financial system is doing two million transactions per second now, moving that to DeFi might require 20 million to 200 million transactions per second,** that is probably being conservative.

**Radix is the only public ledger system I know of that has any kind of roadmap for delivering this kind of scale**. Ethereum 2.0 isn‚Äôt close. **Solana isn‚Äôt close**. Layer two isn‚Äôt close. Everything else in the space is magnitudes off where we need to be to achieve public ledger systems that can execute at the scale the world actually needs to fully digitize the financial system as we know it and allow an entirely new breed of innovation.

**3. What's the alternative to Solidity?**

Okay, so programming languages are something that a lot of people have a lot of really passionate views about! Solidity was based on JavaScript. This was chosen because it is the world‚Äôs most popular programming language so they wanted it to be easy to pick up.

However, it isn't actually JavaScript. It is a weird monster that has a lot of the bad points (not being strongly typed, being difficult to reason about the execution of) plus a bunch of extra problems just for Solidity (tricky reentrancy issues being the one that continually hurts).

Ethereum didn't know what they were building the language for, could be anything they reasoned. Turned out they were building it for finance, they just didn't know, then DeFi came along.

Now ‚Äî if you asked the CTO at a neobank (like Monzo, or Revolut or N26) to build their core system in JavaScript, they would beat you to death with a baseball bat. No sane developer would choose, willingly, to build a critical financial application in JavaScript. Yet here we are as an industry.

We didn't so much as get inspired to change from Solidity, we just started at the obvious place: if we know that the killer application for public decentralized ledgers is DeFi, what should the language that people use to build these world changing financial applications look like?

After that, it was pretty obvious that Soldity had to go.

From there, we spent around a year interviewing leading DeFi developers and projects to find out what kind of language would work well. We were already working on our own language, Scrypto, but that customer learning period was critical to shaping it into something honed specifically for the right purpose: building decentralized finance applications.

Scrypto will be released at the end of this year, and we are keeping further details close to our chest for now. All I will say is that if you program Rust, you will feel right at home. If you don't program Rust and want to build on Radix, go learn Rust. In fact, go learn it anyway, it's an awesome language for lots of reasons.

Scrypto is not Rust, but we've taken a lot of inspiration from it, and we believe we have worked out a way of making it possible to build secure DeFi applications quickly and effectively. Hence our mantra: Build fast and don‚Äôt break things!

**4. And what's your answer to replacing the Ethereum Virtual Machine?**

So, first of all ‚Äî why does the Ethereum Virtual Machine need to be replaced? In simple terms, because it is bad for financial applications.

This is a complex issue, but it ultimately comes down to two things: speed and security. Many people don‚Äôt realize that the EVM is actually one of the biggest things slowing Ethereum down right now; so much so that it is one of the main reasons that Ethereum only does 15 transactions per second. For the more geeky, [it is an IOPS problem, rather than a network latency issue](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1164200569474621440?s=20).

Add to this the fact that the EVM is mostly [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) (except for the gas limit) you end up getting a system that becomes very hard to reason about ALL the states that a smart contract \*might\* get into (including error states). This issue sits right at the heart of many of the hacks and exploits that happen on Ethereum today.

So, how do you increase the performance and security of a network without doing anything to the consensus algorithm? Simple, you change the execution environment. Rather than inheriting all the issues of EVM, Radix created an incredibly fast, incredibly secure state execution machine we call the ‚ÄúRadix Engine.‚Äù

Unlike the EVM, Radix Engine is a programmable conditional [Finite State Machine (FSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine). This is the same technology that you find in mission critical code like nuclear power control systems, fly-by-wire avionics or high throughput matching engines of the type you might find in the Nasdaq stock exchange. Not only are these orders of magnitude more efficient, they are also MUCH more secure because the number of error states the system can get into in the first place is massively reduced.

The compiler takes the Scrypto language (which is expressive and flexible) and compiles down the Scrypto code that a developer on Radix wants to push to the Radix ledger into a set of Finite State Machines that run the specific smart contract logic the developer needs.

By the time the Radix Engine v2 is released, we expect this to 100x the execution efficiency of DeFi on Radix vs Ethereum even before we even start thinking about the extra scalability expected to be delivered by the Radix consensus system.

**5. Any other tricks up your sleeve?**

Absolutely. DeFi is pretty good at being entirely permissionless (which is a great thing!) ‚Äî however, as the industry is evolving, there is an increasing number of circumstances where users need to complete AML/KYC checks. The problem is that currently, users need to do this on a platform-by-platform basis, often going through the same process every time they set up a new exchange account, participate in a token sale, or use a fiat ramp. It‚Äôs slow. It‚Äôs awkward. And it‚Äôs inefficient for both users and the platforms.

This is why when Radix was looking at building some compliance tools for ourselves, we saw an opportunity to provide a unified solution that can help the whole Radix ecosystem by providing a compliance solution for DApp builders who want it, while also enabling users of that DApp to connect frictionlessly.

This is why we made [Instapass.io](http://instapass.io/), a single sign-on solution for DeFi compliance. Once a user has provided KYC documents in Instapass and successfully passed the verification, in the future, they will have the choice to share this information with services that use Instapass. This avoids the need to repeat the same process with different platforms, services, and DApps that are integrated with Instapass.

The first service to use Instapass will be [Instabridge.io](http://instabridge.io/), which will allow eXRD holders to swap between eXRD and XRD quickly and efficiently. Looking to the future, especially around the Babylon release of the Radix Public Network, Radix developers will have the option to integrate with Instapass to offer their users a low friction way to complete compliance requirements if needed.

**6. Aren't you worried that Solidity is too well established for Radix to succeed?**

No. Programming languages are merely a tool to enable a developer to translate their ideas into actual working systems. Like any tool there are good tools and bad tools. The industry is stuck with Solidity because it was the first language available. That does not make it a good language, nor one that is easy to get competent in.

From our discussions with many of the leading DeFi projects on Ethereum, one of the key things that comes up a lot is the incredible shortage of talent in the space. With crypto projects offering HUGE salaries for Solidity experience, and with crypto being such a hot area of technology, why would this be the case? Solidity has been around for almost six years now.

The simple reason is that while it is easy to get started with Solidity, it is incredibly hard to master it. The learning curve plus the fundamental unattractiveness of the language as a development tool all contribute to a low amount of good Solidity developers.

There are a million examples of better tools coming into a space that everyone thought was mature (Webflow, Figma, Google, Facebook, OnePlus, WeWork, Pipedrive, and so on,) as well as many, many programming languages that have come in and replaced those that came before.

We think we are building something special for DeFi developers and we are super excited to be releasing it towards the end of this year. It certainly won‚Äôt be perfect, but we think it will be an order of magnitude better than what is here already, and that really matters for both new talent coming into the space, as well as the speed and security at which projects can build and innovate.

**7. How are you going to encourage developers to embrace Radix?**

It isn‚Äôt JUST technology that will win here. The entire DeFi space is built on the incredible work of a community of tens of thousands of developers who have contributed their time and intellect as opensource code, and to build the tools that make it possible to build a billion dollar DeFi application like Compound.

The problem is that on Ethereum the benefit of that code often doesn‚Äôt flow back to the community of developers that built it. This is because there is no easy way in DeFi to both contribute open source and charge for use of your software, unless you build an entire financial application like Aave or Uniswap.

On Radix this problem is being addressed by an on-ledger DeFi code library called the Blueprint catalogue. This is a library of ready-to-use DeFi code, like you would find on Github, but with a developer royalty system integrated into it, so that developers can not only contribute to the Radix ecosystem, they can also get rewarded for doing so every time a project integrates that developer‚Äôs code into a new decentralized financial application.

If this is combined with the ease of building the Blueprints in the first place due to the simplicity of the Scrypto programming language, we are confident that the Radix ecosystem will be able to reach feature parity with the Ethereum ecosystem pretty quickly.

**8. What are the hurdles that stand in the way of achieving mainstream use?**

Honestly, the biggest problem right now is still private key management. Private keys and seed phrases are still one of the most terrifying parts of crypto for most people and will continue to be a barrier to entry for some time to come.

There are some good indications of what might be the right direction with projects such as Argent creating a smart contract based social recovery system that does not require you to hide a piece of paper under your mattress and hope that you don‚Äôt lose it, but there is still a long way to go before it gets to the point that the everyday person will feel comfortable with being their own bank.

There are also a number of other additional issues including the difficulty of getting money into and out of crypto; the high gas fees; the difficulty of the user experience of things like Metamask; the lack of insurance that is provided by default to cover things like smart contract bugs (you have to go and find the right insurance, which can be tricky); and the huge difficulty the casual investor has in telling the difference between a good project and a scam.

These are all solvable, some of which Radix is working directly on solutions for, some of which will just be a matter of time and maturity, but I still think the old issue of key management is still holding the space back more than people realize!

**9. What's GoodFi?**

Radix founded the not-for-profit GoodFi consortium with a clear mission: Get 100 million people to put at least $1 into DeFi by 2025. Members now include Aave, Sushiswap, mStable, Chainlink, Avalanche and many more.

We founded GoodFi because we believe, and our members share the belief, that we are in the early days of a massive technology revolution. In the early days of any revolution, one of the most important things is to educate and expand the audience. GoodFi was created to increase the number of people who have heard of DeFi, and give people a safe space to start their DeFi journey.

In the early days of the internet it was difficult to get people online. You needed to convince people to get the internet connected to their house. You often needed to convince people to buy a computer for the first time. You needed to then get them to learn to use a web browser. All these things we now take for granted but back then it was HARD.

Today, to get into DeFi, you need a web 3.0 wallet, some crypto currency and to choose your first DeFi app. These are all hard things, and one we all felt was worth investing money into making the newbie journey as easy as possible for!

**10. Last but not least, can you share your goals for the next 12 months?**

Olympia mainnet goes live on July 28, and our programming language is released at the end of this year.

Between those two dates, Instapass.io, Instabridge.io will continue to grow and develop, and we will continue to engage and grow our fantastic community.

Shout out to everyone in the Radix Telegram, Discord and Twitter community!

There is a lot to deliver this year, and we are just going to keep grinding and keep delivering."

Radix explained: Copy of the Interview 21 july 2021 with CEO Piers Ridyard And: huge; SCRYPTO is to be released in okt-dec 2021! Radix 1000 x better than Solana,https://www.reddit.com/r/Radix/comments/q1fc2q/radix_explained_copy_of_the_interview_21_july/,jibberdidee,1,2021-10-05 05:11:16,3,/r/Radix/comments/q1fc2q/radix_explained_copy_of_the_interview_21_july/,NaN," 

**Radix expalined: interview 21 july 2021** **CEO Piers Ridyard** :

DeFi has grown exceedingly fast ‚Äî and when this happens, it‚Äôs inevitable that teething problems will emerge.

Here, we talk to Piers Ridyard, the CEO of [**Radix**](https://www.radixdlt.com/)**.** He tells us what his company is doing to address some of the main pain points in this sector ‚Äî and the challenges that consumers and developers currently face.

**1. Hello! Can you tell us about Radix?**

Absolutely. Radix is **the first public decentralized network built specifically to serve decentralized finance (DeFi).** This was necessary because **with DeFi on Ethereum, building sucks ‚Äî there have been over $285 million in hacks in the last two years alone.** The networks are slow and inefficient ‚Äî gas fees keep hitting record highs and costing the users millions of dollars, and the growth of the space is being fundamentally held back by network congestion.

We like to say Radix is ‚Äúlayer-one DeFi done right,**‚Äù** this is because Radix is the only decentralized network where developers will be able to build quickly without the constant threat of exploits and hacks, where every improvement will get rewarded, and where scale will never be a bottleneck.

Radix is building three huge improvements to DeFi technology that will be released over the next 3 years:

**1. 10x DeFi developer productivity**. Right now, DeFi developers spend up to 90% of their time securing their code rather than building functionality. Despite that there have still been over $285m of DeFi hacks, bugs and exploits to date on Ethereum.

**Solidity** (the **Ethereum programming language**) is a big part of the problem. **Radix is building** a purpose-built DeFi programming environment ""**Scrypto""** that will enable fast AND secure development, giving DeFi developers more time to focus on innovation rather than security.

Our programming language **Scrypto** is scheduled to be **released in Q4 2021.**

**2. 100x DeFi execution efficiency.** The **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is where all DeFi smart contract logic is executed and it is SLOW.** So slow in fact that it is one of the biggest bottlenecks of DeFi today.

**The Radix Engine** is designed **to change the game** by replacing the EVM **for a lean, mean, state-executing machine.** You can think of it **like upgrading a computer CPU from one built 20 years ago to Apple‚Äôs best new processors. Incredibly fast,** more energy efficient, and able to do a whole heap of stuff in parallel.

**The Radix Engine v1** is released with the first Radix mainnet launch on July 28 2021.

**The Radix Engine v2 is scheduled to be released in 2022.**

**3. 1000x DeFi scalability.** DeFi on Ethereum is expensive to use. This is because it is not scalable, but popular, which creates a huge amount of congestion. What many underestimate is the sheer magnitude of transactions these systems will have to deal with. **To replace the global financial system will require processing of millions of transactions per second,** which **is well beyond the capabilities of platforms like Ethereum** 2.0 or **Solana,** and also completely beyond the capabilities of layer-two scaling solutions.

Radix built their consensus algorithm, **Cerberus,** to deliver **something entirely unique to the blockchain industry** ‚Äî **linearly scalable atomic composability** for DeFi. This means the long term Radix system should not only deliver **millions of transactions per second**, it should do so **in an entirely DeFi native way.**

The fully sharded, linearly scalable version of the Radix public network is scheduled for our Xi‚Äôan release in 2023.

These three foundation pieces of technology deliver our vision of a public permissionless infrastructure for the global financial system to run on.

**2. Is the industry approaching scalability the right way?**

**The industry understands that scalability is a problem, but I think there is a common misunderstanding about how large the problem is.** To illustrate, it is a little bit like trying to work out how scalable the internet needs to be by calculating how many phone calls are done around the world and using that as the approximate amount of data that the internet would need to handle.

The numbers aren‚Äôt even going to be close. But this is the problem, we currently know about phone calls (transactions for finance) in the global financial system, but we have only just started to understand what websites (smart contracts for DeFi) are going to require bandwidth wise.

The 2,000 transactions per second that Visa does is often quoted as the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù for scalability, forgetting that Alipay did [256,000 transactions per second](https://twitter.com/Alipay/status/929123909970153472?s=20) on their busiest days in China, in 2017! And this is just one system. The total financial system today probably averages about 2m transactions per second just ticking over.

Add to this the fact that on DeFi everything is connected. One transaction on Uniswap can set off tens or even hundreds of other smart contract interactions, doing everything from updating oracle prices to running arbitrage bots or yield farming strategies. One transaction in DeFi is not one transaction, one transaction can end up triggering tens or even hundreds of smart contract logic executions.

So, if **the global financial system is doing two million transactions per second now, moving that to DeFi might require 20 million to 200 million transactions per second,** that is probably being conservative.

**Radix is the only public ledger system I know of that has any kind of roadmap for delivering this kind of scale**. Ethereum 2.0 isn‚Äôt close. **Solana isn‚Äôt close**. Layer two isn‚Äôt close. Everything else in the space is magnitudes off where we need to be to achieve public ledger systems that can execute at the scale the world actually needs to fully digitize the financial system as we know it and allow an entirely new breed of innovation.

**3. What's the alternative to Solidity?**

**4. And what's your answer to replacing the Ethereum Virtual Machine?**

This avoids the need to repeat the same process with different platforms, services, and DApps that are integrated with Instapass.

The first service to use Instapass will be [**Instabridge.io**](http://instabridge.io/), which will allow eXRD holders to swap between eXRD and XRD quickly and efficiently. Looking to the future, especially around the **Babylon** release of the Radix Public Network, Radix developers will have the option to integrate with Instapass to offer their users a low friction way to complete compliance requirements if needed.

**6. Aren't you worried that Solidity is too well established for Radix to succeed?**

No. Programming languages are merely a tool to enable a developer to translate their ideas into actual working systems. Like any tool there are good tools and bad tools. **The industry is stuck with Solidity because it was the first language available.** That does not make it a good language, nor one that is easy to get competent in.

From our discussions with many of the leading DeFi projects on Ethereum, one of the key things that comes up a lot is the incredible shortage of talent in the space.

These are all solvable, some of which Radix is working directly on solutions for, some of which will just be a matter of time and maturity, but I still think the old issue of key management is still holding the space back more than people realize!

**9. What's GoodFi?**

**Radix founded the not-for-profit GoodFi consortium** with a clear mission: Get 100 million people to put at least $1 into DeFi by 2025. Members now include Aave, Sushiswap, mStable, Chainlink, Avalanche and many more.

**We founded GoodFi because we believe, and our members share the belief, that we are in the early days of a massive technology revolution**. In the early days of any revolution, one of the most important things is to educate and expand the audience.

**10. Last but not least, can you share your goals for the next 12 months?**

Olympia mainnet goes live on July 28, and **our programming language Scrypto is released at the end of this year.**

Between those two dates, Instapass.io, Instabridge.io will continue to grow and develop, and we will continue to engage and grow our fantastic community.

Some of the Most Intriguing Yield-Farming Apps,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/q1hzde/some_of_the_most_intriguing_yieldfarming_apps/,Wolf_Joe,1,2021-10-05 07:18:23,1,/r/investing_discussion/comments/q1hzde/some_of_the_most_intriguing_yieldfarming_apps/,NaN,"Yield farming is the popular strategy DeFi users take advantage of to put their cryptocurrencies to work to earn high interest.

There are multiple types of yield farming projects offering different financial services, mostly to earn astonishingly high interest. Large banks might earn you 0.01% to 0.25% a year, but these sub-percent yields can‚Äôt compete with the 20% to 200% earnings some DeFi platforms tout. Often, the higher the interest, the riskier the staking pool is.

Here are some of the most interesting yield-farms in 2021:

1. Uniswap: 20-50% APR Uniswap is the second-largest decentralized exchange (DEX) behind Curve Finance by total value locked with more than $5.5 billion in the platform. The platform offers swaps with Ethereum and thousands of ERC-20 tokens and staking in liquidity pools to provide the swaps. Liquidity providers earn a percentage of trading fees for every swap, and with a large enough principle deposited, they earn significant interest. Interest rates on Uniswap and all other DEXes vary by the pool and market fluctuations.
2. Aave: 0.01-15% APR Aave is the reigning DeFi king in terms of total value locked with a staggering value of over $10 billion, according to [DeFiPulse.com](https://defipulse.com/). Aave is a decentralized platform on Ethereum (and the Polygon sidechain) that offers low-interest cryptocurrency borrowing and lending. Because investors have deposited so much crypto into Aave to earn interest, its borrow APRs are some of the best on the market. Variable borrowing of stablecoins (like DAI, USDC and USDT) range from 3% APR to 7% at the time of writing.
3. ZooKeeper: 5-58% APR Zookeeper brings a new and interesting farming experience, leading to experience higher mining rewards and richer and more interesting NFT gameplay. ZooKeeper is a brand new project built as a Wanchain Dapp. It is entirely conceived and developed by passionate members of the community with some collaboration from the Wanchain team. ZooKeeper drastically improves the functionality of NFTs by giving them a real use case within their platform. They provide a dual farming experience while embracing the popular crypto trend of NFTs.
4. PancakeSwap: 8-250% APR PancakeSwap, like Uniswap, is a decentralized exchange (DEX). It functions similarly to Uniswap but is on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network instead of Ethereum and has a few more features focused on gamification. It holds the highest total value locked of all BSC DeFi projects by a mile at about $7 billion. PancakeSwap offers BSC token swaps, interest-earning staking pools, a gambling game where users predict the future price of BNB and even non-fungible token (NFT) art.

What are some of the other interesting yield-farming projects you've come across?"

Some DeFi tips from Lossless,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/q201wm/some_defi_tips_from_lossless/,yung_fluff,1,2021-10-06 00:28:50,2,/r/defi/comments/q201wm/some_defi_tips_from_lossless/,NaN,"Mods/everyone, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post links ( I will leave the link out unless someone confirms its ok? 

I wanted to share an excerpt from this Q n A with Lossless, about yield farming/DeFi security. 

They are basically working on a way to freeze hacks, and to revert funds back to the protocol/users (yes, they will have a token, if the project works well, this will be one to watch imho). Just more security info, which i use also rugdoc and other platforms (before aping in, lol)

q+a Excerpt:

***Q: What are the first things that a yield farmer should look at before entering a position in a new yield farm?***

I‚Äôd say the farmer should try to find assets which are correlated between themselves and offer a decent APY to maximize returns and minimize impermanent loss (for this there are tools in the market like [https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/](https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/)).

But if you really want to yield farm and be good at it, the general notion is that you need to look for new pools with high potential and come early, when the pool liquidity is small and the volume is expected to shoot through the moon. Of course, it is an opportunity-based approach and these ‚Äòdeals‚Äô don‚Äôt last for long, usually competing farmers join the liquidity pools and the APY smoothens. Also, farming in new pools increases rug-pull risk significantly, because new and unverified assets are involved.

A lot of people also forget to take in the gas fee costs into their calculations.

Farming is a full-time job, there are a lot of moving factors to take in before making a decision.

&amp;#x200B;

***Q: Do you have any advice for our readers about how to recognize potential ‚Äúrug-pulls‚Äù?***

What works best for me personally is to go to the official chat, talk to the team, ask them advanced questions and make them explain to you why a certain pools has this kind of APY, what‚Äôs their strategy, see what the community is asking. If the chat is full of bot accounts and generalized messages ‚Äî that‚Äôs an instant red flag for me.

Try to find out who are the team members, their previous experience. Rule number #1 is be patient. I understand that sometimes when you see 1000% APY you have that instinct rush to ‚Äòape in‚Äô but if you spend some time actually trying to find out if the farm in question is legit, you‚Äôll be able to do it. It‚Äôs a matter of self-discipline and the signs are usually there.

***Q: What would you recommend as the ‚Äúsafest‚Äù Yield Farming platforms? Aave and Compound?***

It depends on what‚Äôs your target. I use SushiSwap and UniV3 a lot at the moment, Badger Finance for wrapped BTC yield and Curve for stablecoins. I trust these teams, I like their content, their community and their track record so far, I think they‚Äôre the true innovators in the space.

But I am OK to accept lower APY rates than the average yield farmer. I‚Äôd rather stay in a pool for 3 months than move from protocol to protocol every few days. That minimizes the risk too...."

More and more applications have been developed based on the blockchain. People have seen its potential to be applied in financial, social life and organization management. For example, Metaverse shows how it can support people‚Äôs imagination without any boundary. Defi shows how it can redefine the financial and capital activity to enhance the efficiency for people to create more social wealth.

"Thinking PhD isn't the right fit, 1 month in",https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/q25ft7/thinking_phd_isnt_the_right_fit_1_month_in/,Proper-Membership,10,2021-10-06 04:57:53,21,/r/PhD/comments/q25ft7/thinking_phd_isnt_the_right_fit_1_month_in/,Vent,"Firstly, to all others on here that feel like first year has felt overwhelmingly like drinking from a fire hose ‚Äì I‚Äôm right with you. I‚Äôm posting to seek advice from others in this community on whether it would be a bad idea to withdraw.

I am now one month into a fully-funded accounting/finance PhD program in Canada. I came directly from industry after having obtained my CPA designation and spending a couple more years out in industry getting more experience. I had no research background going into this, since my master‚Äôs was entirely course-based and focused on getting you to pass the CPA qualifying exam. As such, my quantitative and research skills are somewhere between weak and entirely non-existent.

I have always dreamt of getting a PhD through my teenage/younger adult years ‚Äì mostly because I wanted to teach and saw the PhD as a prestigious, challenging way to fulfil that goal. I also love learning about accounting standards and wanted to keep doing that without the constraints of needing to meet audit deadlines. I was reaching a wall at my last job where I wasn‚Äôt learning or growing and combined with the pandemic, knew it was time to leave. I figured that it was a good a time as any to try applying to PhD programs to learn more about the process and see what would happen. I only applied to the one school in my current city (mostly as a test run) and did not expect to get accepted.

And here is where I admit I made a mistake. I think I was misguided in what being an accounting researcher (a researcher in general) entailed and glamourized academe as a magic pill for my general job dissatisfaction. I wish I had spent more time understanding the culture and expectations. Before starting, I had read academic papers in my free time and thoroughly enjoyed consuming them ‚Äì however, now I‚Äôm not sure if I have a real interest in producing my own original research. I kind of finish reading papers and think to myself ‚ÄúOK, I guess that‚Äôs cool‚Äù before just setting it aside. I‚Äôm not a super creative person. On top of that, I was expecting the coursework to be similar to my master‚Äôs, in terms of somebody teaching me with the skills needed to conduct good research, especially the quant skills that I so desperately lack. While I know we are only a few weeks into the first term, I am quickly realizing that a lot of the programming, modelling and statistic skills are ones that you are expected to independently learn in relation to conducting your own projects. All this is to say ‚Äì I should have discovered this sub-reddit sooner, and I should have asked better questions of profs/other PhD students to better understand what I was getting myself into. I let myself get swept up in the excitement of the acceptance.

I don‚Äôt want to make the same mistake twice and think of quitting as the next magic pill. Because I‚Äôm so new to the academic world, I don‚Äôt want the decision to withdraw to be based on the first-year learning curve. At the same time, I feel like the opportunity cost of staying in the program is quite high personally. Aside from the social and mental costs of being busy and stressed all the time under a mountain of coursework, I left a pretty well-paying job/career for the opportunity to become an academic; aside from becoming a professor proper, almost all other accounting career paths would still be available to me without a PhD. Moreover, if I were to return to industry after this 5-year journey, I don‚Äôt think the industry would really reward the fact that I have a doctoral degree. In other words, it seems to me that the only reason to stay would be if I was certain that I wanted to be a prof‚Ä¶which I‚Äôm not at this moment (and not sure if I ever was).

So my questions to Reddit are the following ‚Äì acknowledging that it ultimately will be my own personal decision based on my own personal factors:

1. Is it too soon to be thinking about leaving? Does it get better/does one learn to like research?
2. What am I losing out on if I leave? If I quit, will I be blacklisted from academia forever?
3. If I do decide that it‚Äôs not the right fit for me, when is the most ideal time to start the administrative process of withdrawing? Do I wait until the end of the term, the end of the year, the end of my summer research paper? How do I go about this gracefully?

All perspectives are welcome‚Ä¶thank you in advance for helping out one very confused girl."
Short &amp; Distort,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WPL_Eightix/comments/q2g6fw/short_distort/,WPL_Eightix,3,2021-10-06 16:27:11,0,/r/u_WPL_Eightix/comments/q2g6fw/short_distort/,NaN,"**Preface:** As always, any profitable trade I engage in, **25% of profit will go to AMC**, unless I have to bring account current in which case **pray for me**.  I apologize in advance for all of the small talk, I keep myself focused and entertained by putting some wandering thoughts on the page.  I try **my best** to explain everything in laymans terms. Any paragraph *italicized* is skippable from a DD standpoint.

TL:DR To bring it all home, this is what happened in this extremely f\*\*\*\*\*d situation:  zack tweets, dingleberry sees tweet, stock rises, dingleberry buys the stock (buying and selling along the way, careful not to deter momentum,) they block sell at the peak ruining momentum and simultaneously shorting CEI, they share negative news (possibly even buying a yahoo article piece to encourage selling,) they sell their remaining position on the way down to encourage sell pressure, bottom falls out, tries to recover.

I believe this information has a place in AMC sub because even though we have currently seen drops, we haven't seen them in conjunction with a **reputable** fund(s/o to Rich Greenfield and Iceberg Research? you'd think I would remember because I laughed so hard.)

Alright, after a few drinks I think I've managed to get my ADHD ass settled down and into a productive space.  Today I want to talk **Shorting &amp; Distorting** \- a hedgef\*\*\* maneuver that a fund like Karrisdale Capital (Dingleberry) might use when they're feeling bold.

In full transparency here is my CEI trade: Bought .80 sold 1.40.  Said wtf and bought back in at 1.80 and sold at 4.30.  I left open a few shares for shits but I averaged wayyyyy down buying almost twice my current position between 1.10 and 1.20 after all of today....but what happened today?

CEI popped up on my momentum tracker last week and I thought that it was definitely tradable, at least for swing if not outright daily.  I later found out that this thing was (maybe) a product of someone called Zack Morris who has more followers than Jesus on Twitter (well, almost.) After searching through his history dude is clearly a swing trader that thrives on attacking shorts.  My problem with this current situation is he inadvertently gave power to a fund, but he gets a pass because he's likely from Fresno, as he recently posted a song from a rapper that lives in the valley, and as a homegrown central California valley boy I am very familiar with the music scene.

Now you might be reading this and wondering what in the absolute f\*\*\* does this have to do with AMC?  Well the answer is: Iceberg Research, but that's eating desert before the meat and potatoes. Calm down.

CEI is struggling.  In debt. In big debt. Not only are their earnings bad but they're so bad that they could've been knitting in their offices as a collective this past year and made more than their company produced.  Let's chop it up to preparation.  I am now long in the company so I should refrain from noise. Either way I instinctively **CANNOT** help but root for the underdog.

So let's check the score: struggling company, yes; shorted, yes; active on social media, yes; annnnd here comes the curve ball: retail interest.

So here's where we get into S&amp;D.

CEI had **10 halts** on 8/5.  I might be wrong on this but from what I saw 9/10 were from significant drops in the share price.  I recall being upset on 9/29 because halts weren't initiated until 20% ish drops whereas halts were initiated on 8%+ ish rebounds.  Sus.  8/5 CEI had **29** news updates on Thinkorswim (ToS). Never have I ever..........seen that many f\*\*\*\*\*\*\* news updates on a ticker. (28 of them were bearish). This is where **Dingleberry** comes in.

This is conjecture, but I believe **Dingleberry** was **frontrunning** the stock.  (In this instance front running means they bought the stock on the way up, effectively **PUMPING** the stock, in my mind this is also what we saw earlier this year in AMC ""Jesus told me to sell at 50, I no longer want to hurt funds etc."") Dingleberry went along for the ride, selling on the way up but still averaging up.  The first bit of ""news"" came at 8:10AM, and holy shit was it miraculously followed by a massive **DUMP.** The price was at 2.76, after **multiple**  halts it was down to 1.40.  **This is where I find relevance to AMC.** This is theory but if we follow other meme stocks and learn from their trajectories, we will find that stocks will have **wild swings** however, the traders in CEI were **swing traders**  who follow trends.  AMC is not like this.  I have watched my p/l go from some monstrously odd gain down to some other monstrously odd gain, but I admit (please do not mistake me, 97% of my ports holdings are AMC) for clarity I am long on CEI for the **SAME REASON.** Allow me to explain.

*I wanted to sell in the 70s. I did. My WoW arena buddy who I've known for 4 years called me dumb af for not - but my girl would slaughter me if I did.  We share the port, we pay into it, I manage it, but I made the promise of deferment unless I had something I believed in.  I believed in AMC, again, to me there is no more a classic date than a burger, a beer, a movie, and things I will never talk with my mother about.  What I cared about* ***was threatened.*** *It ""behooved me"" to protect my interest (s/o to my fellow Army enlisted).  So I did, and I bought nothing except more than AMC between 9 to 15, of course I've averaged up to 24. It was somewhere along this line I found the* ***absolute f\*\*\*ery that is the stock market.***

I found conviction and an absolute resolve in my dedication to CEI.  To that end I hope that it is not a debt shell and that there's profit from their carbon capture endeavors. **Nine negative** news updates followed as the stock dropped to a low of 1.03.  It halted upwards at least once, until it reached 1.47 now this is where things **get really f\*\*\*y.**

Here is a link to Dingleberry Capital's Twitter update regarding their ""position"" on CEI

[https://twitter.com/KerrisdaleCap/status/1445405812931846148](https://twitter.com/KerrisdaleCap/status/1445405812931846148)

Now, Dingleberry posted this at 8:09 price at 2.79.  Within 30m stock is at 1.39.

I am part of an extremely active (and therefore FUD/bots are extremely active) online FB community. (#putsonfb)  This article was screenshot and posted.

https://preview.redd.it/oys01dgtesr71.jpg?width=432&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f42d553c8ba6859cf5183f3d98ded620dd6f94e

Now the relevance is hit or miss - but we've all seen the data about people being swayed by propaganda on FB.  I **cannot find this article** on yahoo finance.  As you can see the timing of this was 10:10 AM. Any guess on what happened to the stock afterwards? If you somehow guessed 1.49 to 1.01 you'd be right. Again, **this was to deter buying and encourage selling.**

So to bring it all home, this is what happened in this extremely f\*\*\*\*\*d situation:  zack tweets, dingleberry sees tweet, stock rises, dingleberry buys the stock (buying and selling along the way, careful not to deter momentum,) they block sell at the peak ruining momentum and simultaneously shorting CEI, they share negative news (possibly even buying a yahoo article piece to encourage selling,) the sell their remaining position on the way down to encourage sell pressure, bottom falls out, tries to recover.

This week we are going to review a few projects that our community asked us to take a look at. Many of these projects are small emerging platforms with low TVLs and poor liquidity making them high risk. Even stratospheric APRs can't compensate for the risk inherent in most of these new platforms. Our recommendation would be to stick to the more established platforms. There is no shortage of high APR staking options available without the additional risk of betting on an untested platform. 

[**This week‚Äôs APRs from leading staking and yield farming platforms**](https://cryptoquestion.tech/stakingandfarming/)

The biggest developments are:

**Compound**

Last week Compound put out what should have been a routine update to the code that governs users' transactions. However, the update contained a bug that mistakenly sent up to $89 million worth of crypto tokens into some users' accounts.

Compound Labs noticed ""unusual activity"" late Wednesday, but at that point the tokens were already distributed with no easy way of getting them back. 

The company's founder, Robert Leshner, quickly took to Twitter to persuade Compound users to return the surprise windfall ‚Äî veering from persuasion to praise to threats against anyone who doesn't return the tokens.

**Pancakeswap**

Staking CAKE became much more attractive with it‚Äôs APR increasing to 73%.

Whilst its raciest farm is offering 5,393% when farming CART-BNB. CART is a NFT market place with a $60 million market cap and $1 million daily value. Worth a closer look.

**Sushi** 

This week definitely saw a marked increase in the APRs on many of the platforms. This included Sushi which increased its APR on staking SUSHI from 8 to 12% and is offering a top rate of 12,637% for farming USDC-SAK3. Not one we would be investing in unless you are a sake fan.

**Curve**

Even the slightly more conservative Curve was offering a 87.42% APR by staking EURN-EURT, an investment for the professional trader not the staking enthusiast.

**Yearn**

Yearn was offering a racier than usual 676% APR by staking CURVE-MUSD. This is worth further investigation as Curve is a quality platform/project.

**Platform Reviews**

**KogeCoin aka KogeFarm -**  [KogeCoin price, chart, market cap and info | CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kogecoin) 

KogeFarm.io is an auto-compounding utility built for DeFi users. KogeFarm helps you earn more yield by auto-compounding every five minutes. It claims to have the lowest fees in Polygon and is audited by Obelisk.

**Our Opinion**

Let‚Äôs examine the basics. KOGECOIN has a market cap of $32 million with $27 million of TVL and daily volumes of around $300,000.

It‚Äôs platform is easy to navigate albeit with limited options. KogeFarm is a high risk platform with farms from CafeSwap (TVL $7m), PolyBeta (TVL $9m) and Curve. 

The platform is paying an APY of 490% for staking its native Kogecoin, a return that accounts for the fact that the token looks overvalued when compared to its lower TVL. 

It‚Äôs racier propositions included staking BREW (CafeSwap) and earning 1,142% APR and Alpha (PolyAlpha Finance - TVL 182,000 a total imitation of PolyBeta) 1,292% APR. Out of these BREW would be your best bet, but CafeSwap isn't going anywhere fast as a project and Alpha, well its a joke!

**Cometh swap**

ComethSwap is a layer 2 decentralized exchange, which lets you swap any ERC20 tokens at low cost, it currently trades 40 coins with some $250,000 of daily volume. In addition it offers over 60 different farms.

**Our Opinion** 

This platform is clearly for the seasoned staking professionals. The TVL is not transparent which is our first cross in the box and some of the tokens you can't even find on the main listing sites. Its highest APY is 158% when you farm MATIC-wPTG. Our question is, what the hell is wPTG? 

**Toad Network**

TOAD.Network is committed to creating the safest and most decentralized farming community on the Binance Smart Chain. TOAD's team donated all of their LP tokens to the LP farm where users can farm more liquidity. 

**Our Opinion**

TOAD has a market cap of $4.7 million, TVL of $1.6 million and daily volume of $170k. We are still trying to identify the person or persons who asked us to take a look at this one! It is far from easy to navigate and understand and in our opinion if you can't even get the basics right then you don't deserve to succeed. This is one for the garbage.

The company's founder, Robert Leshner, quickly took to Twitter to persuade Compound users to return the surprise windfall ‚Äî veering from persuasion to praise to threats against anyone who doesn't return the tokens.

**Pancakeswap**

Staking CAKE became much more attractive with it‚Äôs APR increasing to 73%.

Whilst its raciest farm is offering 5,393% when farming CART-BNB. CART is a NFT market place with a $60 million market cap and $1 million daily value. Worth a closer look.

**Sushi**

This week definitely saw a marked increase in the APRs on many of the platforms. This included Sushi which increased its APR on staking SUSHI from 8 to 12% and is offering a top rate of 12,637% for farming USDC-SAK3. Not one we would be investing in unless you are a sake fan.

**Curve**

Even the slightly more conservative Curve was offering a 87.42% APR by staking EURN-EURT, an investment for the professional trader not the staking enthusiast.

**Yearn**

Yearn was offering a racier than usual 676% APR by staking CURVE-MUSD. This is worth further investigation as Curve is a quality platform/project.

**Platform Reviews**

**KogeCoin aka KogeFarm**

KogeFarm.io is an auto-compounding utility built for DeFi users. KogeFarm helps you earn more yield by auto-compounding every five minutes. It claims to have the lowest fees in Polygon and is audited by Obelisk.

**Our Opinion**

Let‚Äôs examine the basics. KOGECOIN has a market cap of $32 million with $27 million of TVL and daily volumes of around $300,000.

It‚Äôs platform is easy to navigate albeit with limited options. KogeFarm is a high risk platform with farms from CafeSwap (TVL $7m), PolyBeta (TVL $9m) and Curve.

The platform is paying an APY of 490% for staking its native Kogecoin, a return that accounts for the fact that the token looks overvalued when compared to its lower TVL.

It‚Äôs racier propositions included staking BREW (CafeSwap) and earning 1,142% APR and Alpha (PolyAlpha Finance - TVL 182,000 a total imitation of PolyBeta) 1,292% APR. Out of these BREW would be your best bet, but CafeSwap isn't going anywhere fast as a project and Alpha, well its a joke!

**Cometh swap**

ComethSwap is a layer 2 decentralized exchange, which lets you swap any ERC20 tokens at low cost, it currently trades 40 coins with some $250,000 of daily volume. In addition it offers over 60 different farms.

**Our Opinion**

This platform is clearly for the seasoned staking professionals. The TVL is not transparent which is our first cross in the box and some of the tokens you can't even find on the main listing sites. Its highest APY is 158% when you farm MATIC-wPTG. Our question is, what the hell is wPTG?

**Toad Network**

TOAD.Network is committed to creating the safest and most decentralized farming community on the Binance Smart Chain. TOAD's team donated all of their LP tokens to the LP farm where users can farm more liquidity.

**Our Opinion**

TOAD has a market cap of $4.7 million, TVL of $1.6 million and daily volume of $170k. We are still trying to identify the person or persons who asked us to take a look at this one! It is far from easy to navigate and understand and in our opinion if you can't even get the basics right then you don't deserve to succeed. This is one for the garbage.

This week we are going to review a few projects that our community asked us to take a look at. Many of these projects are small emerging platforms with low TVLs and poor liquidity making them high risk. Even stratospheric APRs can't compensate for the risk inherent in most of these new platforms. Our recommendation would be to stick to the more established platforms. There is no shortage of high APR staking options available without the additional risk of betting on an untested platform.

The company's founder, Robert Leshner, quickly took to Twitter to persuade Compound users to return the surprise windfall ‚Äî veering from persuasion to praise to threats against anyone who doesn't return the tokens.

**Pancakeswap**

Staking CAKE became much more attractive with it‚Äôs APR increasing to 73%.

Whilst its raciest farm is offering 5,393% when farming CART-BNB. CART is a NFT market place with a $60 million market cap and $1 million daily value. Worth a closer look.

**Sushi**

This week definitely saw a marked increase in the APRs on many of the platforms. This included Sushi which increased its APR on staking SUSHI from 8 to 12% and is offering a top rate of 12,637% for farming USDC-SAK3. Not one we would be investing in unless you are a sake fan.

**Curve**

Even the slightly more conservative Curve was offering a 87.42% APR by staking EURN-EURT, an investment for the professional trader not the staking enthusiast.

**Yearn**

Yearn was offering a racier than usual 676% APR by staking CURVE-MUSD. This is worth further investigation as Curve is a quality platform/project.

**Platform Reviews**

**KogeCoin aka KogeFarm**

KogeFarm.io is an auto-compounding utility built for DeFi users. KogeFarm helps you earn more yield by auto-compounding every five minutes. It claims to have the lowest fees in Polygon and is audited by Obelisk.

**Our Opinion**

Let‚Äôs examine the basics. KOGECOIN has a market cap of $32 million with $27 million of TVL and daily volumes of around $300,000.

It‚Äôs platform is easy to navigate albeit with limited options. KogeFarm is a high risk platform with farms from CafeSwap (TVL $7m), PolyBeta (TVL $9m) and Curve.

The platform is paying an APY of 490% for staking its native Kogecoin, a return that accounts for the fact that the token looks overvalued when compared to its lower TVL.

It‚Äôs racier propositions included staking BREW (CafeSwap) and earning 1,142% APR and Alpha (PolyAlpha Finance - TVL 182,000 a total imitation of PolyBeta) 1,292% APR. Out of these BREW would be your best bet, but CafeSwap isn't going anywhere fast as a project and Alpha, well its a joke!

**Cometh swap**

ComethSwap is a layer 2 decentralized exchange, which lets you swap any ERC20 tokens at low cost, it currently trades 40 coins with some $250,000 of daily volume. In addition it offers over 60 different farms.

**Our Opinion**

This platform is clearly for the seasoned staking professionals. The TVL is not transparent which is our first cross in the box and some of the tokens you can't even find on the main listing sites. Its highest APY is 158% when you farm MATIC-wPTG. Our question is, what the hell is wPTG?

**Toad Network**

TOAD.Network is committed to creating the safest and most decentralized farming community on the Binance Smart Chain. TOAD's team donated all of their LP tokens to the LP farm where users can farm more liquidity.

**Our Opinion**

TOAD has a market cap of $4.7 million, TVL of $1.6 million and daily volume of $170k. We are still trying to identify the person or persons who asked us to take a look at this one! It is far from easy to navigate and understand and in our opinion if you can't even get the basics right then you don't deserve to succeed. This is one for the garbage.

Bitcoin Taproot Soft Fork Upgrade: DeFi competition for Ethereum and other blockchains?,https://www.reddit.com/r/technologygate/comments/q3esba/bitcoin_taproot_soft_fork_upgrade_defi/,Gijs_Groenland,1,2021-10-08 02:00:37,0,/r/technologygate/comments/q3esba/bitcoin_taproot_soft_fork_upgrade_defi/,NaN,"The latest Bitcoin update was the Segregated Witness (SegWit) soft fork update in 2017. This eventually ended in a split in the Bitcoin community and to an undesirable hard fork that created Bitcoin Cash.

In November 2021 Bitcoin will undergo a significant soft fork upgrade. In contrast to the SegWit update, this update has the full support of the Bitcoin community and the risk of an unexpected hard fork like the one in 2017 is negligible.¬†

This upgrade, Taproot, can finally give Bitcoin the power to launch itself into the world of smart contracts. In my opinion, there is even a chance that Bitcoin will be able to compete with other blockchains that offer smart contracts of which Ethereum is the biggest. Especially in relation to DeFi. The number one question that comes with this upgrade: ‚Äúis this upgrade already accounted

for in the current price?‚Äù. This post will give some more insight into the Taproot soft fork upgrade and the improved functionalities it offers. Hopefully, this will explain why it might be attractive to develop DApps for smart contracts on Bitcoin after the upgrade and why it isn‚Äôt interesting right now without the Taproot upgrade.

The taproot can be split into three Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) and I will explain all three of them in more detail.¬†

 **BIP340 Schnorr**

Currently, Bitcoin uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) as cryptographic code. ECDSA has been used since the beginning of Bitcoin but is not seen as completely fire-proof. Though there have not been any attacks that have successfully cracked ECDSA, formal security proof is still not discovered. Additionally, ECDSA can‚Äôt be compressed which means that it can‚Äôt aggregate multiple signatures into one signature.¬†

With the Schnorr upgrade, Bitcoin will introduce the ‚ÄúSchnorr signatures‚Äù scheme. Schnorr uses a mathematical structure as the basis for its digital signature system. This feature effectively reduces the network‚Äôs data load, improving privacy and allowing for a faster transaction verification process. In contrast to ECDSA, Schnorr signatures are provably secure because they include easily verifiable security proof. Schnorr‚Äôs key aggregation feature also combines all the public keys involved in a multisig transaction. This requires participants to perform signature aggregation to produce a single signature for its aggregated key. This technique eliminates the requirement that more than two users are involved in the transaction and reduces the size of the transaction from a larger multisig transaction to a smaller single-sig transaction. This is important in order to be able to handle smart contracts in an efficient way. Schnorr also enables bip-taproot which means that bip-taproot is useless without Schnorr.

Shortly summarized, Schnorr signatures are less complicated, quicker, and are provably secure. All big advantages/improvements over the current ECDSA application.¬†

Fun fact: Schnorr signatures is not a recent innovation in cryptography. Claus-Peter Schnorr invented Schnorr in the 1980s. Now the question is of course why Schnorr was not used during the launch of Bitcoin if it outclassed ECDSA. The reason for this is that the Schnorr patent expired in 2008, the same year that Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin. Because the cryptographic signature scheme was patented for 20 years, most innovation revolved around the open-source ECDSA scheme. Schnorr signatures were only shortly released when the patent stopped and this meant that there was a lack of utilization, standardization, and testing in software at that time in order to secure a global monetary system like Blockchain. This is the reason why Satoshi chose ECDSA over Schnorr: it was patent-free, it was standardized and it was an open-source encryption tool.

**BIP341 Taproot** 

This adds ‚ÄúTaproot‚Äù to Bitcoin. Taproot is a privacy solution that utilizes Schnorr signatures to enable Merklized Alternate Script Trees (MAST). MAST uses Merkle trees (data structures used for data verification and synchronization) to make smart contracts much more efficient and private by only revealing the condition of the contract that was met without giving up any details inside the contract. In the old situation, all conditions were revealed during verification and synchronization. You can compare this for instance when you have to show your ID to verify your age when you want to buy alcohol at a supermarket. Imagine that by showing your ID you also show your complete personal file with your home address, blood group, license number, marital status, and shoe size, to the person at the counter that only wants to verify your age. All other information is completely irrelevant. Before Taproot it worked like that with contracts which is pretty ridiculous in my opinion. This was another reason why it was not interesting to develop DApps for smart contracts on Bitcoin. With the MAST implementation, the problem where all spending conditions are revealed during a transaction will be solved. You won‚Äôt be able to see it anymore.¬†

Bip Taproot also introduces a new script type known as Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR). This allows outputs to be spent using a single Schnorr signature to satisfy the keypath spending condition or by revealing and satisfying one of the scripts from the Merkle tree. This means that DApp developers can write more complex scripts for fewer fees because they can be compressed into a single hash because of MAST.

**BIP342 Tapscript**

Tapscript is an upgraded scripting language that complements the Schnorr and Taproot upgrades by improving signature hashing to validate Taproot scripts. It introduces more flexibility by enhancing Bitcoin‚Äôs smart contract capability. It also changes some limits for resource requirements, including the removal of the 10K byte size limit that currently exists in legacy scripts. Additionally, Tapscript provides ‚Äútagged public keys‚Äù. This is a forward-compatibility mechanism and it makes it easy for future soft forks to extend the signature-checking opcodes (the portion of a machine language instruction that specifies the operation to be performed) with new sighash types or other changes. This reduces the risk that a developed DApp becomes unusable with a new soft fork upgrade in the future.

Compared to Schnorr and Taproot, it might seem that Tapscript is not really worth mentioning. However, it is a key piece of the puzzle. Verification of signatures is the most computationally intensive operation in a script. The reason for this is that signatures are all verified individually. Allowing signature batch verification, Bitcoin will realize a big efficiency boost, complemented by Schnorr and Taproot.¬†

**A brief summary**

The Taproot soft fork upgrade will allow multi-signature (multisig) transactions and complex smart contracts to be indistinguishable from standard transactions. This is done with key aggregation: a smart contract is completed at address creation time and not at signing time or post-signing time. Because of this, even the most complex smart contracts will be virtually identical to the regular transactions on the blockchain. This means that Taproot‚Äôs signature aggregation technique can improve the privacy of the Lightning Network (LN), an application that is built upon Bitcoin to improve scalability by making LN-related transactions look like single-signature transactions instead of multiple signature transactions. Because of Taproot, opening and closing channels will look like standard single-signature bitcoin transactions. This is done by packaging signatures. Because of this, the details of multi-signature transactions can remain private and users will pay lower transaction fees. This means that after Taproot, Bitcoin Lightning Networks should become more intuitive and cost-effective for users, using less energy as well.

For DApp developers this update might be very interesting. Taproot permits more complicated multisig contracts and opens up the possibility of Bitcoin-based Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAOs) and other Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications.

Users who want to verify Taproot transactions have until November 16th, 2021 to update their node software to Bitcoin Core v0.21.1. This is the newest version of Bitcoin Core and it contains activation logic for the Taproot soft fork.

**Final thoughts**

So now, it‚Äôs up to you to try to answer the question many crypto investors ask themselves. How big will the impact of the Taproot upgrade be? Personally, I think the Taproot upgrade won‚Äôt have a significant value impact when it launches. Of course, this depends on the value of bitcoin at the launching date. If crypto is in a bear market and bitcoin has an attractive price at the time of launch, it might bring a spark to bitcoin. I don‚Äôt want to sound negative but the spark can be short-lived as well. In the case of a bull market in combination with a higher price, I don‚Äôt expect an increase. 

Once DApps for smart contracts (and in particular DeFi) are becoming available for Bitcoin, the state of uncertainty might change. I suggest keeping a very close eye on the smart contract developers instead of looking at the bitcoin value graph on the stock exchange. Personally, I will look to the long term and not to the short term. 

If DApps are coming to Bitcoin in the future it might be the beginning of something beautiful. A price increase is almost certain when there is a successful adaption/acceptance of Bitcoin by DApp developers. This would also mean extra competition for smart contract blockchains like Ethereum because of the big support that Bitcoin has. Imagine a world where the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum is being reduced because of internal competition. This would make it possible to have a more defensive portfolio because of less correlation between cryptocurrencies.

On the other hand, it can also be a bust if there is no interest from DApp developers. My opinion is that there will be interest because Bitcoin is the biggest blockchain there is. If I was a DApp developer I would at least research the opportunity to separate myself from my competitors to offer smart contract applications on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Bitcoin rallied to a five-month high Friday ahead of a monthly U.S. jobs report that could cement expectations the Federal Reserve (Fed) will start unwinding crisis-era stimulus starting in November.

The top cryptocurrency by market value rose to $56,100, hitting the highest since May 12 and taking the month-to-date gain to 27%. It was recently trading about $55,270.

The U.S. non-farm payrolls (NFP) report scheduled for release at 12:30 UTC on Friday is expected to show the world‚Äôs largest economy added 500,000 jobs in September, more than double August‚Äôs 235,000 additions. The jobless rate is expected to have dropped to 5.1% from 5.2%, according to FXStreet.

Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020, bitcoin has become sensitive to critical macro data releases, like the NFP, influencing the Fed‚Äôs monetary policy. This time, however, the cryptocurrency could ignore the data, even if it beats estimates and cements the case for the Fed taper. A weak report would, in any case, be positive for asset prices in general.

The indifference is because the bitcoin market is currently focused on speculation that U.S. regulators will soon approve a futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), opening doors for more mainstream money. The cryptocurrency appears to be on a solid footing, having decoupled from stocks and bounced hard from $40,000 despite adverse macro developments on institutional participation, as hinted by the surging premium in futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).

‚ÄúBitcoin is looking too strong here,‚Äù said Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange. ‚ÄúThe cryptocurrency has digested all the negative news that has come out of China in the past few weeks, which is a very positive sign.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere has been fresh spot buying activity in BTC, and looking at the price action, we expect to see a fresh ATH in the coming weeks,‚Äù he said, referring to an all-time high. The current record is $64,801, reached in April.

According to Singapore-based QCP Capital, there has been an overwhelming amount of outright buying in CME-based futures. ‚ÄúThere are many reasons to be bullish; the stabilization of the Evergrande situation, possible upcoming approvals for BTC ETFs in the U.S., more traditional finance stalwarts like Soros Fund Management turning crypto-positive,‚Äù QCP Capital said.

Analysts told CoinDesk last month that bitcoin would remain resilient to any Fed taper. Being at the far end of the risk curve, bitcoin likely priced in an early end of stimulus during the May slide from $58,000 to $30,000. That was when the taper concerns first surfaced.

‚ÄúThe crypto \[world\] isn‚Äôt paying too much attention to quantitative easing \[stimulus\], and there is certainly a lot of money floating around the system, though, looking to invest in crypto projects at the moment,‚Äù Anthony Vince, global head of trading at GSR, told CoinDesk last month.

QCP Capital is cautiously bullish and foresees pullback if leverage, as measured by futures open interest, continues to rise. ‚ÄúBTC OI is reaching levels \[seen in chart below\] that tend to precede market sell-offs. We will start to be cautious of potential downside risk if OI levels continue spiking,‚Äù QCP Capital said in its Telegram channel."
Due Diligence - 10/8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BBIG/comments/q47cr6/due_diligence_108/,14stonks,1,2021-10-09 05:32:35,119,/r/BBIG/comments/q47cr6/due_diligence_108/,NaN,"To all fellow BBIG shareholders,

This is my first reddit post &amp; first attempt at due diligence.

In this post I will go over in some detail the Unaudited Proforma Combined Balance Sheet of Vinco Ventures &amp; it's subsidiaries dated June, 30th 2021, which was filed with the SEC on 10/06/2021 as the 8-K/A *Current Report - amendment.* On the actual document it is exhibit 99.3 which has a hyper link that takes you to the proforma. Link below. I will also try to provide some information on key investors (Notably Hudson Bay) as well as key individuals involved within the company. Most of this is general commentary with the observation of public data but highlighting developments I believe are bullish.

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1717556/000149315221024725/ex99-3.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1717556/000149315221024725/ex99-3.htm)

To begin, the proforma above is dated June 30th 2021. **I believe that this proforma is bullish because it does not include the additional cash that has been added to the balance sheet since 6/30, which I estimate to be between $50-$146m of cash not included here. Proforma statement shows $84m in cash &amp; I estimate that BBIG has anywhere between $172m-$230m of cash on hand currently.** This could be a set up by BBIG management to issue an updated balance sheet which surprises the market (positively) once the Lomotif acquisition value is included as well as Tyde spin off valuation &amp; dividend ratio. It is possible that the company could release updated financial statements (they will have to eventually anyway) once Merger is closed &amp; Tyde Val/ratio determined that **could show the combined entities holding $400-$600 million dollars in cash. The company would hold more cash than what public markets are currently valuing it at (as of 10/8 \~$530 million).** I believe BBIG management is well aware of the hype surrounding the firm &amp; wants to capitalize on this as well, even stating there will not be any further share issuance (however we will still have to deal with existing warrant exercise). I believe BBIG management is being strategic &amp; has the potential to release news at any moment that could cause huge buying pressure in the stock.

A potentially bullish scenario could be that BBIG announces Tyde dividend ratio &amp; valuation of Tyde, &amp; it could potentially have a greater market cap than BBIG itself. This is unlikely, as I believe the minimum market cap to list on NASDAQ is $50 million, but even so a spin off of Tyde at a market cap of say \~$250 million dollars would be extremely bullish, &amp; not out of the question given how hot the NFT space is. 

I believe a scenario like this could cause intense upward buying pressure to fully value Tyde into the market cap of BBIG but also buyers entering to receive shares of Tyde. This is just one potentially bullish scenario. 

**As of June 30th BBIG had $84.8 million in cash on hand along with 59.93 million shares outstanding (**[**https://ycharts.com/companies/BBIG/shares\_outstanding**](https://ycharts.com/companies/BBIG/shares_outstanding)**).** On June 30th the stock closed at $3.95, &amp; had a market cap of about \~$166 million.  Since then the stock has rallied about 28% to its price at the time of writing ($5.04) however we've all seen the two rallies it had to $12 in early &amp; mid September. The current market cap as of writing is \~$530 million. What the June 30th proforma does not include are the \~23 million shares that have been added to the float via warrant exercises. **The current total shares outstanding are about 97.28 million shares. Even the latest investor deck released on Vinco Ventures investor relations site shows 80 million shares outstanding as of 09/03 &amp; cash of $127 million.** This investor deck does not factor in about 17 million shares that have been added to the float via warrant exercise since then. The warrants have been dilutive &amp; added supply to the float, causing the price to sink on some days while the market cap remains unchanged (dilution 101), much to the chagrin of current holders. **In exchange though, once the warrants are exercised the firm receives additional cash from the investor for the shares.** Lets say that the average issuance price of these warrants is $2.65 (price range seen in most of their SEC filings for warrant issuance), that would give them additional cash on had of \~$46 million dollars (97.28 outstanding - 80 million outstanding) x 2.65=45.7. **I believe the firm is currently operating with closer to $172 million in cash, which would give it a cash per share price of $1.77, which means at $5/share it is trading for about 35% cash.** **This estimate may be conservative, as prior to Lomo acquisition the firm issued at a convertible note of 30 million shares with a conversion price of $4. This was when the firm had 27.9 million shares outstanding. These have likely been exercised &amp; BBIG could be trading with as much as $230 million in cash currently, which would give it a cash per share price of \~2.36 a share, meaning about half of its market cap is cash. (**[**https://investorplace.com/2021/07/bbig-stock-has-closed-deal-with-lomotif-but-details-end-there/**](https://investorplace.com/2021/07/bbig-stock-has-closed-deal-with-lomotif-but-details-end-there/)**)** See below snips from investor deck &amp; warrant liability from S1.

**In my opinion, the warrant issuance has stunted some of the momentum of the rally because of the new supply, but I believe the near term catalysts are still strong enough to push this stock higher.** 

**The other elephant in the room, in addition to the Tyde dividend, is the Valuation of Lomotif.** The eventual release of the Lomo valuation is a major catalyst for the firm short term as well. Lomo last raised money before being purchased in 01/01/2021 in a late stag VC financing, then again once it was acquired by ZVV &amp; BBIG on 7/23/2021. I'm unable to access the valuations Lomo has been financed/purchased at, but it may be on [pitchbook.com](https://pitchbook.com), however I do not have a subscription to this site &amp; they mainly only provide subscriptions to professional investment funds or universities &amp; not so much smaller individual investors. **The last 4 stages of Lomo financing it has been valued at a ""Generating Revenue"" stage.** 

Obviously the much referenced $5 billion dollar Gemini valuation based on per use SensorTower data has been talked about a lot. The opportunity for Lomotif to gain market share in India &amp; Southeast Asia (as well as U.S., but more entrenched competitors) is obviously great due to the fact that tik tok is banned in India. BBIG &amp; ZVV paid a significant amount of cash &amp; stock to acquire Lomo. What investors want to know is what that puts Lomo valuation at. **If Lomo does have the user base (31 millioon MAU &amp; growing user base) it says it does, then a $5 billion dollar valuation seems reasonable (compared to other short form video platforms), especially as the company makes improvements to the platform &amp; starts to monetize the platform. Ultra low interest rates &amp; accommodative central banks around the world have pushed investors further out onto the risk curve. A side effect of this has been record equity markets as well as record valuations for start up firms. I think these current Market Conditions could push Lomo valuation higher.** In 2021, there were a record number of unicorn companies (private start ups valued &gt;$1 billion, 186) ([https://eqvista.com/complete-list-of-unicorn-companies-2021/](https://eqvista.com/complete-list-of-unicorn-companies-2021/)). I believe that there is no better time for a private firm to take advantage of cash rich equity markets &amp; it would come as no surprise to me that when Lomo becomes public via this acquisition it will be valued well above the $1 billion mark. The eventual release of the merger valuation document (which must be released, per the SEC) will shed light on this. Just to give readers a range of valuation, I've added some info about Tik Tok's late stage financings. Beginning in June 2014 tik tok received a $100m investment valuing them at $500m, 3 years later in April 2017 a $1b investment at an $11b valuation ([https://news.crunchbase.com/news/as-companies-battle-for-tiktok-a-look-back-at-its-funding-history/](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/as-companies-battle-for-tiktok-a-look-back-at-its-funding-history/)). **Equity markets have appreciated greatly since 2014 &amp; 2017. I believe a $125m cash + stock investment/acquisition of Lomotiff would give the firm at least a &gt;$1b valuation, as valuations in equity markets, both private &amp; public, have increased greatly since Tik Tok received its valuations in 2014 &amp; 2017.** 

**Hudson Bay Capital**

Hudson Bay Capital is a multi billion dollar asset management firm that operates out of the U.S. &amp; London &amp; seeks to maximize returns through traditional &amp; non-traditional securities. ([https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/who\_we\_are#leadership?bio=undefined](https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/who_we_are#leadership?bio=undefined)). Hudson Bay Master Limited Fund currently owns 54,641,646 common shares &amp; warrants. The warrants are included in this number, because Hudson Bay is subject to an anti-dilution clause which prohibits them from owning greater than 9.99% of the shares outstanding at any time. From Notes of beneficial ownership (p.77 of S1): 

**""Hudson Bay Master Fund Ltd. may not exercise such warrants to the extent (but only to the extent) such selling stockholder or any of its affiliates would beneficially own upon such conversion or exercise a number of shares of our common stock which would exceed 9.99% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.""**

**If I am interpreting this correctly, this is potentially impactful because it could prevent the warrants from flooding in &amp; adding to the share supply all at once (because they can't own more than 9.99% of firm, subject to anti-dilution clause), thus giving the stock more time to run &amp; create buying pressure on the existing supply of shares.** I fully expect these warrants to be exercised over time, which will dilute existing shareholders but also continue providing the firm with funds. **In the short term however, share supply could still be constrained which would be great if buying pressure comes in. Additionally, The CEO &amp; Founder of Hudson Bay Capital Mr. Sander R. Gerber owns 975,541 shares of BBIG, his spouse Lelainya Ferguson owns 1,455,750 shares of BBIG, &amp; an LLC Mr. Ferguson disclaims beneficial ownership of (FergcoBros) holds 13,000 &amp; 350,500 shares of BBIG. I doubt the CEO of the Hudson Bay, BBIG's biggest shareholder wants, to dilute himself or his clients.** These are extremely well informed &amp; sophisticated investors holding large portions of BBIG stock, which I find bullish. They want to see their investment do well, but hopefully do not dilute other shareholder too much at once. I wonder if this DD will come across their desk, I am sure they are following developments closely. (\*The fund may own more shares/warrants, I saw another table showing 77 million warrants owned by Hudson Bay).

Another important piece of warrant information that caught my eye as well is the 22m warrants issued to Hudson Bay with an exercise price of $9. Why would a multi billion dollar fund with a plethora of investing experience across a variety of asset classes accept $9 warrants? Probably because they think the share price will eventually be much greater than $9. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Players**

Short sellers love to point to Ted Farnsworth involvement in this as some of his prior endeavors, notably the failure of MoviePass, have hurt shareholders. That is a risk you take in investing, &amp; while I don't know too much about Farnsworth I do believe that entrepreneurs deserve second chances (unless its an Elizabeth Holmes deal). MoviePass seemed promising but so have thousands of other businesses that have failed. I am sure there is experience he can bring that will help the firm.

Paul Yang, the creator of Lomotif, will be staying on as a director as well as being Chairman of the Board of Lomotif. I think that it is bullish that the founder is staying on in a hands on capacity &amp; now being given the resources needed &amp; the team to monetize his creation. 

**Summary**

I find the upcoming Tyde spin off a big reason for investors to accumulate even more shares. The Tyde spin off is especially intriguing. Rapper Tory Lanez claims to have sold over 1 million copies of his album ""When Its Dark"", though it has not gone without its hiccups as users have reported difficulty transacting the album at times. Regardless, if the infrastructure can be put in place to provide an efficient way for Artists to release NFT albums &amp; purchasers to essentially trade them it should attract other artists &amp; could give E-NFT (Tyde) early market share in a nascent business. See the album for yourself here:([https://www.e-nft.com/nft/0x9e6a55b6b4563e652a23be9d623ca5055c356940](https://www.e-nft.com/nft/0x9e6a55b6b4563e652a23be9d623ca5055c356940))

Additionally, the Lomotif valuation &amp; recent Adrizer acquisition could prove bullish as well. If it ends up coming out that the value of the Lomo platform &amp; it's user base is indeed in the billions, the stock could potentially double, triple, or quadruple, based on valuation. Also, BBIG is most likely currently trading with much more cash than what is currently shown to investors in SEC filings &amp; Investor deck. **BBIG most likely currently has $170-$230m in cash on hand, which could make it even more attractive to short term value seekers. If BBIG is able to factor in the Lomo MAU multiple &amp; ability to monetize that user base with Adrizer acquisition, the value of the overall business could very well be in the $3-5b range.** Short term I believe that the conditions exist for a strong run up in price. These conditions include high short interest, high cost to borrow &amp; high share utilization rate, a massive amount of call options that market makers would potentially have to start hedging if the stock price begins to move up, &amp; two catalysts that have the potential to create huge amounts of buying pressure if well received by investors. In my opinion, these conditions create a perfect storm for BBIG shareholders to be massively rewarded in the short term &amp; could prove disastrous for short sellers. Conversely, the news could disappoint &amp; further warrant issuance could continue to dilute shareholders while shorts pile on &amp; drive the price lower. I am hopeful that BBIG management will execute both their long &amp; short term strategy (you have not seen insider selling, only buying), &amp; capitalize on retail enthusiasm for the company. If the right conditions meet the stock price could run massively. 

If there is anything you feel is incorrect or would like to add please comment below. My goal with this post was to try and bring information that would benefit existing investors. Knowledge truly is power so if you have some free time take a look through company financial statements on EDGAR or read through Investor decks. I am very bullish on this stock &amp; hope to generate more positive retail interest. If you have anything that you believe is useful or any feedback please add below.

ps I am a Graduate finance student at a University in the Southeastern United States. My passion is researching &amp; investing in stocks/securities I believe are undervalued as well as helping other investors learn more about the market &amp; become successful investors. I would like to pursue this as my career (securities investment) so if you have any career tips or advice feel free to DM. I am also holding 39 Call Option Contracts, with 3 expiring 10/15, 1 expiring 10/22, then the rest are contracts &amp; LEAPs expiring in January 2022, April 2022, Dec 2022, &amp; January 2023, all with an average of about $7-8 strike price, in addition to 200 shares. In total I've invested around $10k into this play. 

I hope this helps instill some confidence back into the community. Market Manipulation certainly has come to the forefront of retail investor attention that past 12 months or so. However there are few greater feelings than when you hold through tough periods, average down, have conviction in your research, and it ends up paying off, often greater than you could have imagined. 

I hope you all have a great, safe weekend. Thanks for reading.

Juggling with multiple internship offers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/q47r04/juggling_with_multiple_internship_offers/,Adam598,1,2021-10-09 05:53:34,2,/r/Accounting/comments/q47r04/juggling_with_multiple_internship_offers/,NaN,"Hi all,

I currently have 3 summer internship offers that I am deciding from:

I can't seem to decide which offer to pick. I'm a student pursuing my BBA in Accounting.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the offers:

Goldman Sachs - Fraud Risk Analyst Internship

KPMG - Business Tax Services Internship

Nestle - Finance &amp; Accounting Internship

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my order of what I will pick so far:

1)  Nestle Internship. The reason is they later offer you a 3.5 year finance rotational program where you get exposed to a lot of corporate accounting/finance work, both in manufacturing and corporate.

2) Goldman Sachs. This role is more IT geared so I do have a significant learning curve as it does contain Python, SQL, and Tableau. However, the name ""Goldman Sachs"" speaks for itself and comes with a lot of prestige.

3) KPMG. I don't like narrowing my career path to Tax. I enjoy work that allows me to learn and move around different roles in business; whether it is finance, accounting, strategy, or data analytics. Tax seems like too much of a narrow field for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Goldman Sachs &amp; KPMG are local so I get to be around my family.

With Nestle, I'm basically living off my suitcase. I'm constantly traveling to new locations, even for the internship. However, Nestle's entry level salary is actually slightly better. Additionally, I love Nestle's culture a lot more while Goldman Sachs seemed very cut throat and it seemed like they cared about nothing else but money (no care about culture/people), although I will say KPMG was a lot better than Goldman when it came to culture/people. It's just that Nestle was better. 

If you could share your thoughts on what I should pick and why, I would HIGHLY appreciate it. 

Thanks in advance."
SheepDex Discord AMA review: How does SheepDex help maximize your capital efficiency by more than 10x?,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SheepDex/comments/q4hpri/sheepdex_discord_ama_review_how_does_sheepdex/,SheepDex,1,2021-10-09 17:11:06,2,/r/u_SheepDex/comments/q4hpri/sheepdex_discord_ama_review_how_does_sheepdex/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lv93l9172es71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6963aae4d0c0f28d8172e1d83f2a478f56489f2d

Thank you all for coming to the AMA session. Today‚Äôs topic is ‚ÄúHow does SheepDex help to maximize your capital efficiency by more than 10x?‚Äù We will also invite u/Isabel_SheepDex , CMO of SheepDex, and CEO, u/SheepDex to join us exploring the current DeFi market and how do we leverage SheepDex to improve our capital efficiency.

**Q1. What is SheepDex?**

SheepDex (sheepdex.org) is the 1st decentralized exchange (DEX) that integrates spot and derivative trading. It offers both LP transaction fee refund and traders trading rewards, while allowing liquidity providers (LPs) to allocate funds within a certain price range, thereby improving the fund efficiency, reducing the slippage, and centralizing trading depth.

In the next, SheepDex will continue to launch more innovative feature such as perpetual contracts, leveraged tokens, lottery and more.

SheepDex aims to be decentralized Binance.

**Q2. Is SheepDex open-source auditing?** 

Yes, the contract is open-source. And the contract code has been audited by CertiK and it is expected to be audited by PeckShield. More audit firms will be involved to ensure the security of the SheepDex contract. 

**Q3. How is the technology of SheepDex? Why is the team so anonymous?**

SheepDex team is completely anonymous and is based in the US, Singapore, China, Dubai and other countries. We are an experienced and skilled multinational team, some of our key members have developed well-known DeFi projects such as public chains and DEXs. Basically we are scattered around the world, so whenever something goes wrong with networks or policies in one country, our team in another country can respond faster. And SheepDex trusts smart contracts more than any regulations. It has been audited by Certik and more leading audit firms, which will help provide users with a more secure and anonymous experience.

As I mentioned regarding the team's anonymity. Our team members are located in different countries and regions. I am in Dubai, Kiki is in Australia, and our development centers are mainly in the US, KD is in Singapore.

We're all scattered right due to the pandemic, but we'll see what we do when things are back to normal.

**Q4. What are the advantages of SheepDex compared with other DEXs?**

1. The 1st DEX integrating spot and derivative trading;
2. Range Order system to provide liquidity: users can add liquidity within a certain price range of the specified trading pair.
3. Multiple and flexible fee tiers: Provide more market making options and strategies for LPs;
4. Improved oracle: Adopt time-weighted average price (TWAP) to reduce gas fees.

**Q5. What exactly are triple incentives?**

1. LP transaction fee refund: LP transaction fee refund for completing the transactions within the price ranges;
2. Transaction rewards: When the transaction is completed, the user‚Äôs trading fees will be returned in the form of pool tokens so that both users and exchanges can be benefited;
3. Yield farming: Deposit specified token assets as required to provide liquidity for the liquidty pool and obtain token rewards.

**Q6. Many of us are not very clear about liquidity, can you explain that?**

Market liquidity refers to the extent to which a market allows assets to be bought and sold at reasonable prices. It refers to the relationship between the time scale of an investment (how easy for it to turn into cash) and the price scale (the discount compared to the fair market price).

(High liquidity brings openness and transparency to the markets. For traders, the higher the liquidity, the lower the risk; the lower the cost, and the greater the opportunity).

**Q7. What are the benefits of liquidity?**

Liquidity in the financial and investment sectors can usually be explained as: Liquidity is actually the ability of investors to rapidly trade a certain number of assets at a reasonable price according to the basic supply and demand of the market.

1. To enhance the flexibility and liquidity
2. To reduce the transaction costs
3. To improve the competitiveness of suppliers in the markets
4. To get the best prices for the investors
5. To improve the competitiveness of suppliers in the market
6. To get the best prices for the investors

**Q8. How does Range Order system help concentrate the liquidity on SheepDex?** 

One of the most important highlights of Range Order system is the addition of granular control to the original XY=K curve, which allows liquidity providers to add liquidity within a certain price range, that is, to concentrate capital efficiency in the price ranges where most trades occur in order to achieve maximum returns. In short, it allows liquidity providers to allocate funds within a certain price range, thereby improving the capital efficiency, reducing the trading slippage and centralizing trading depth. 

Another DEX leveraging this system is Uniswap v3. Its innovation primarily lies in liquidity provision. This offers more flexible options and greatly improves capital efficiency, which also makes the DEX a super flexible protocol that can accommodate a wide variety of assets. SheepDex also has the Range Order system which allows liquidity providers to add liquidity within a certain price range and creates an individualised price curve for each LP. This will result in a large aggregation of funds in the price range where most of trades take place, leading to overlapped price curves and thus portfolio liquidity. LPs will be motivated by the fact that the transaction fee refund they earn are proportional to their liquidity contribution within a given range. 

**Q9. SheepDex is built on which public chain? What are the advantages?** 

It is based on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Uniswap v3, a DEX on Ethereum, also has the Range Order system. At present, its trading volume ranks top among all DEXs, with a 24-hour trading volume of about 9 billion USDT. The Range Order system provides excellent liquidity for v3. For the same amount of stablecoins swaps, v3 has the minimal loss. That‚Äôs why bulk trades would choose v3. So far, there is no DEX on BSC that can offer such system. We believe SheepDex will be able to bring in-depth liquidity to the chain with huge throughput. This move will greatly improve the capital efficiency and trading volume on BSC, and can improve the overall APR on BSC due to increased transaction volume.

**Q10. What is the future of SheepDex?**

SheepDex aims to be a decentralized Binance. You can trade on SheepDex as quickly and easily as you would on a centralized exchange (CEX), reducing trading friction and slippages, while experiencing the most liquid derivatives for a great investment experience. But it also has the characteristics of security and privacy of a decentralized exchange (DEX). In the future, SheepDex will be one of the top derivatives platforms in the Blockchain industry. You can also trade bulk and forex on SheepDex. SheepDex will become a Blockchain-based financial clearing and settlement center in the future.

**Q11. What is the status of the project? Is there any progress?**

It only took less than three months since we announced the project to the world, but the technical team has been preparing for this for more than a year. So far, SheepDex has attracted users in more than 20 countries. It now has more than 100,000 followers and members from 60 communities across the world have joined us. Two weeks ago, early 50,000 users participated in our event. 

**Q12. What is the Tokenomics of SheepDex?**

* Total supply: 90 million
* Block time: 3 seconds
* Emission: 3.5 tokens/ block
* Deflation: reduced by 20% every 90 days
* Token allocation:
* Yield Farming 25%
* Transaction rewards 25%
* Derivatives 20%
* Investor 10% 
* Team 8% 
* Marketing 5%
* Branding 3%
* Airdrop 2%
* DAO 2%

**Q13. How do we learn to start with SheepDex ?**

1. Use a BSC-based wallet to open the official website, such as MetaMask;
2. View tutorials in official SheepDex Telegram community;
3. Consult our Telegram admin for online guidance.

**Q14. How can we obtain SPC tokens?**

SPC tokens can be obtained in following ways:

* SPC tokens can be obtained through the Range Order system and yield farming;
* Participate in community activities such as airdrops to get free SPC;
* Conduct a transaction to get SPC tokens;
* Join DAO to get more SPC tokens.

&amp;#x200B;

# User question session:

**Q1:Can you please highlight more on the decentralization aspect using your technology. Also in the future, is it possible to quantify the level of decentralization and economic incentivization?**

SheepDex has been doing a lot more upgrade and evolution of Derivatives in the DeFi space, such as contracts, leveraged tokens, lottery and more. SheepDex Team will also leverage our technology to better implement traditional finance on Blockchain through continuous upgrading.

**Q2ÔºöWill the sheep come out of SPC's trading contract after it is online?**

Derivatives testnet may launch this year

**Q3. I am a little worried about how the anonymous team can ensure the safety of my assets**

SheepDex has passed the audit by CertiK and also under audit by PeckShield, so no worry about your assets

**Q4. How many institutions are currently involved in investment? How much equity do they hold in SHEEP?**

We will gradual disclosure of investment institutions after Mainnet Launch

**Q5.What do you think is the biggest problem #SheepDex will solve, where other projects have not been solved yet, and why is it important to solve this problem?**

Liquidity

After SheepDex goes live, the depth of the transaction of BSC will increase.The DeFi world is full of uncertainties.We are also constantly exploring and improving ourselves.

**Q6.Does SheepDEX consider using loraWAN** **technology in the future?**

We will try all the technologies that are good for SheepDex.

**Q7.Almost every investor holds the token for the short-term without understanding the long-term value. So, how can you ensure for us that holding this token is more beneficial for long-term and what is your plan to increase the demand and scarcity of the token?**

Holding SPC will have the right to vote and Lottery function will launch in Q4 this year

You can focus on SheepDex, not only focus on SPC"
How To Make It In Crypto - From 1K to 100M,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q5589h/how_to_make_it_in_crypto_from_1k_to_100m/,Mekayv,1,2021-10-10 18:04:52,133,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q5589h/how_to_make_it_in_crypto_from_1k_to_100m/,ADVICE,"*Disclaimer: This is something I found, I didn't make this guide nor I take credit for it. However, I do 100% agree with it and been unknowingly following these steps for a few months now. It works! Credit goes to Twitter user Derivatives\_Ape.*

**$1k-100k portfolio (The Hood Rat/Bottom of the Barrel)**

https://preview.redd.it/9b19y9b3jls71.jpg?width=792&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72b680775ee8df6a6e824c828ce14d7692a91d76

If your current portfolio is less than 6 figures, I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend testing new DeFi platforms that haven‚Äôt launched a token yet in hopes of landing an airdrop that‚Äôll boost your portfolio massively.  


Even better if you farm them on multiple wallets and get a big pay check.  
Most projects WILL release a token, because it‚Äôs a great incentive to grab new users.

**$100k-1m portfolio (The Six Figures Hell)**

https://preview.redd.it/qra47h68jls71.jpg?width=788&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4e99a8cdb3cf679aca0403874a29d88d1940ead

Find low cap gems on alt l1s, AVAX and SOL ecosystems are my personal favourite. You can also hunt gems on ETH since you can afford gas fees.  
Trading is still not worth it at this point, high leverage will most likely get you fucked.

**$1m-10m portfolio (Relatively Made It)**

https://preview.redd.it/o3j1amddjls71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea7d1ac5245b1ac1ba54f9988f7c6a3ff22c2c9e

At this point, trading becomes worth it but you will have to ensure that you won‚Äôt get wiped out.  
Utilise DeFi platforms like Aave/Compound to get yield on your collateral, make sure the majority of your stack is in either BTC or ETH. Whether you choose ETH or BTC, choose a benchmark and stick to it. Stack as much as you can.

NEVER EVER sell. 

If you need to make moves, borrow stable coins with your BTC/ETH collateral and use that to trade. Focus on longing, don‚Äôt short.

At the moment you also get paid to borrow USDT on Avalanche and Aave.

**$10m-100m+ portfolio (Made It!)**

https://preview.redd.it/mewts4tkjls71.png?width=477&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a0a963d5a4da3eca42a5c62dd946feb0e87251

Once you get to 8 figures, the optimal thing is to hold onto your wealth.   
Farm some stable coins on Curve Finance or Convex Finance but primarily keep stacking BTC by entering good longs (negative funding is always a bonus and +EV of course).

**Conclusion**

Making it in crypto is very possible starting from the bottom, as long as you have an internet connection and knowledge, you CAN make it. 

Remember the point of alts is to accumulate as much BTC or ETH, stick to low leverage. 

Tortoise wins the race."
Everyone is talking about BTC ETF but Bitcoin is also about to be upgraded for the first time in 4 years. What is Taproot.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q5a8z8/everyone_is_talking_about_btc_etf_but_bitcoin_is/,Blendzi0r,1,2021-10-10 23:31:12,143,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q5a8z8/everyone_is_talking_about_btc_etf_but_bitcoin_is/,ANALYSIS,"In 2017, Segregated Witness (SegWit) soft fork was performed and it was the last upgrade to the Bitcoin‚Äôs network until today. It was also a controversial upgrade which lead to a hard fork (Bitcoin Cash was born). However, Taproot is supported by the great majority of miners and it is expected to activate via soft fork on November 16th this year.

**Taproot includes three Bitcoin Improvement Proposals** (BIPs) that improve network‚Äôs privacy, security and scalability (scalability is, to put it simply, how many transactions per second the network can handle):

1) **BIP340** introduces **Schnorr digital signature scheme** on top of the current Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). In short, Schnorr reduces Bitcoin‚Äôs data load, improves privacy and speeds up transaction verifications. Cryptographers generally agree that Schnorr is better than ECDSA in almost every way with virtually no trade-offs.

2) **BIP341** introduces **Taproot** ‚Äì a privacy improvement that **makes smart contracts more efficient and private** (e.g. only relevant parts of the contract will be revealed. Today, all information is revealed, even that regarding the parts of the contract which weren‚Äôt fulfilled).

3) **BIP342** introduces **Tapscript** ‚Äì a reformed version of Bitcoin‚Äôs scripting language that enables schnort/taproot transactions and **makes future Bitcoin upgrades easier**.

Those improvements will result in cheaper transactions and will enable creating complex smart contracts. But their main feature is **making multisig transactions and complex smart contracts indistinguishable from standard transactions** via key aggregation (this will also tackle the main problem of the Lightning Network ‚Äì privacy).

**Why is it called Taproot?**

https://preview.redd.it/gzb9pl8w5ns71.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93ccbf99d80c0274795120f3a4c80f732f777a12

(A) is how it works today, (B) is how it will work after Taproot activation. Signature verification is the most computationally intensive operation in a script because signatures are verified individually (A). By allowing for signature batch verification (B), Bitcoin can realize its efficiency improvements. **This will open up the possibility of Bitcoin-based Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and other Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications**.

It is also worth pointing out that if Taproot was active in April, when bitcoin transaction fees reached an all-time high, it would have allowed everyone to successfully transfer any number of bitcoins.

**TLDR:** Taproot will increase the number of transactions per second that can be made on Bitcoin, upgrade the network‚Äôs security and privacy, enable complex DeFi smart contracts and help with the main issue of Lightning Network by increasing its privacy. Taproot improves Bitcoin‚Äôs viability not only as a store of value, but also (especially) as a medium of exchange.

Front-Run the Long View on Digital Assets,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexo/comments/q5f6e2/frontrun_the_long_view_on_digital_assets/,an_sci,1,2021-10-11 03:43:13,0,/r/Nexo/comments/q5f6e2/frontrun_the_long_view_on_digital_assets/,NaN,"In this golden age of FinTech, we are slowly moving to a blockchain-based IT world. 10 years from now will be unrecognizable from today in nearly all fields, but especially banking and payments, IT infrastructure, computing, and personal finance. Whole job markets will be transformed as is happening now. Without a doubt, the creation of Bitcoin in at the end of 2008 was a major driver of these trends and this will only grow stronger. Ethereum‚Äôs introduction in mid 2014 greatly advanced digital asset markets to the explosive innovations happening today in multi-purpose, smart contract protocols.

Many more innovations to come have the potential to reasonably match or even exceed what we‚Äôve seen in Bitcoin and Ether, at least in terms of ROI and uses. Can you identify these start-ups and blockchain initiatives? I urge you to do it now! Do it in a BIG and BOLD way. Front-run the long view. Get ahead of the curve that will transform society in ways that will exceed even the internet age.

To do this right, though, you must first focus on the future uses of the current technologies and tokens that are available. Tune out the noise from social media, blinded advocates, flash-in-the-panners, and cut-and-paste slang and mindless code-speak (‚Äúnot your keys‚Ä¶.; DYOR). Also remember the key fact that nearly all of the variation in ROI (90%+) is due to coin selection and not logistics or strategies like transaction costs, DEFI vs. CEFI, which exchange, or allocation percentage. 

These things in the long view are trivial, and typical investors spend way too much time on them. They are losing the big picture and the lifetime opportunity of the FinTech golden age. Also lost is the most important asset there will ever be: Time!

Picking the ‚Äúright‚Äù coins as investments is the only factor worth considering. Be bold but be right! And BOLD means INVEST ALL or NEARLY ALL INVESTABLE ASSETS in your chosen coins (only a few). This plan is not for the timid, and if you don‚Äôt want to take the risk, don‚Äôt. You will be giving up the chance to make the highest ROI possible and it may be unimaginably large. 

However, life is not about ROI but OLS (overall life satisfaction). Of course, the younger you are the more rational it is to INVEST ALL or NEARLY ALL because you have time to recoup if necessary. Alternatively, older people are usually wiser; thus are more likely to select the coins that have the highest potential ROI. Age should not dissuade. Moreover, platforms like NEXO FINANCE, which did not exist 4 years ago, are ready-made to implement an INVEST ALL strategy

Some people actually did invest EARLY ON all they had for BTC and ETH. They sold their houses and cars, cashed out whatever accounts they had, including retirement funds (and would have if available), and borrowed whatever possible . ALL or close to it was bet big because of the future world they saw. 

So what happened if you were smart and lucky enough to do this?

¬∑ Since the public sale in July 2014, ETH is up 12,000X. The sale was open to everyone on a website and you could have bought ETH for 30 cents in exchange for BTC (that was the only option). This is a clear message that timid investors often lose.

¬∑ During this same period, BTC is up 89X. This is fabulous, but you were more than handsomely rewarded in exchanging for ETH at the time.

¬∑ Over its entire history, though, nothing can touch BTC. It is up 1.1mX (yes 1,102,000X) since it was first available to purchase on an exchange for 5 cents in 2010. This ROI has never been matched by any other investment and probably never will be. It is a standard and utopia to strive for.

The lesson: Be bold--maybe even borderline crazy bold--think big, and you may be right. And for many people, it is worth seriously considering and trying. The record from BTC and ETH provides ample evidence of the potential payoff.  For the INVEST ALL or NEARLY ALL IN approach to work, the ROI does not have to be 12,000X or 100X. Even at 5X over the next 5 years, you‚Äôll beat nearly any other traditional investment opportunity by a lot. The annual return of the S&amp;P 500 over many decades is 7%.

A few years ago, I certainly studied all the available evidence and the FinTech transformations that were beginning to occur and invested NEARLY ALL assets. Over a short period of time, I sold my entire stock holdings of Apple, Google, Microsoft, and ETFs; cashed out a sizable percentage of retirement funds; maxed out on any and every possible loan product, and leveraged both stock and crypto lending accounts to a moderate degree, but never touched or considered derivatives and options. Over 90% of my investable assets were moved to digital and this percentage may increase to 95%+ in the future. The ROI has been much higher than the investments I gave up but not up to Ether‚Äôs original return. Looking back, I could have been even bolder. Time and continuing FinTech advances are on my side.

The 100X-1000X question is what are the coins and digital assets available now that can, to a large extent, approach the gains seen over the years in BTC and ETH? The goal is sustainable gains many years and decades into the future. Which particular start-up and blockchain initiatives are most likely to have critical roles in transforming society to the new IT-blockchain frontier that will become the reality?

Ignore the 3-month to 1-year gains from many new tokens (NFT related and others) that surely will not be sustained over 3- to 5-years let alone decades. Betting on the trendy tokens with no track record and little if any use should be avoided. Below are a few categories of possibilities to select a few among them with a caution that a basket or ETF-style approach is not a bold, high-return strategy since one would be averaging gains across bad, mediocre, good, and great bets. My belief is that there are more BTC and ETH sized gains out there that will have outsized roles in the coming digital age. A pure focus on this possibility is more than worth the effort.

¬∑ **Store of value**. BTC, as digital gold, is the absolute king. There is nothing close to this currently but ETH and to a lesser extent Litecoin could be of interest.

¬∑ **Level 1 blockchains (multipurpose)**. Although ETH is the clear favorite and may continue the remarkable past gains, new and established chains are making a big difference, including Cardano, DOT, Cosmos, Solana, Avalanche, and Tezos. There is room for many to co-exist but can any get to ETH‚Äôs level and ROI? At least one of these (or others) are good bets.

¬∑ **DEFI**. The movement to transform banking and FinTech is only beginning and there are likely to be huge winners here. Curve Finance, Aave, Uniswap, Compound, Maker, Balancer, Yearn Finance, Synthetix, and Harvest Finance are the most notable and continue to grow. Off-the-beaten-path tokens are worth considering and researching. You will very likely see M&amp;A activity with traditional banks and financial institutions. Paypal‚Äôs purchase of Curve Finance is the first of many to come.

¬∑ **CEFI**. There is no shortage of centralized lending start-ups that also have vast earnings products for consumers. NEXO FINANCE, Celsius Network, BlockFi, Crypto.com, Voyager, Hodlnaut, and new networks seem to be coming online every week. Lending and earnings options are only going to grow but traditional banks will bring major competition over the next 5 years. Greater regulation will be here very soon. This category is an unlikely 100x from current levels. There are likely to be a few big winners. 

¬∑ E**xchange tokens**. Binance‚Äôs BNB is a top choice along with FTX, Kucoin, and Huobi. Like CEFI, the giant gains one is looking for are difficult to see. The coming regulations could also restrict growth.

¬∑ **Payments**. This area is increasing but without the big growth as seen in DEFI. BTC, Eth, Doge Coin, Monero, DASH, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin are the main chains used today. The problem of course is the expected inverse relationship between ROI and payments.

¬∑ **Cross-border payments and the unbanked**. Stellar‚Äôs XLM and Ripple‚Äôs XRP seem to dominant here with real use cases. XLM, in particular, is focused on reducing unbanked populations in the developing world. This is a signature goal for all of digital assets.  Both start ups can transfer payments near instantly and securely. The SEC case against Ripple may end sooner than expected.

¬∑ **Other**. Emerging areas with many new protocols and start-up are in AI, NFTs, storage, oracles and data services, internet of things, tipping, and all sorts of utilities. These could be among the greatest innovations of the next decade and with the highest ROIs. Deep dives are required to make the best choices and to benefit from luck. A partial list includes LINK, BAND, Fetch.ai, COTI, AXS, IOST, Storj, and Siacoin. Also investigate the tokens listed on Coinbase. They‚Äôve done due diligence checks for you.

A long story short. From my perspective, the best bets are as follows and they are few given the desire for the highest possible ROI and the impossibility of fully understanding more than a handful of initiatives of which to invest with good enough evidence. Limiting to three and a great reward/risk ratio, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Stellar are hard to beat. With the highest potential return, Stellar is a higher risk worth taking. For ROI, it is my first choice. 

The fundamental goal of the BTC-inspired decentralized finance movement of the past decade is that everyone, no matter where they live or the amount of resources they have, must have access to financial services that are easy to use, efficient, borderless, and does not require trusted third parties. My choices don‚Äôt have to be your choices. But be bold, and you really can be right.

I'm simply doing an argument from a Mathematitian's perspective showing what someone being short variance would likely have to do to not go tits up.***

# Introduction

This year, we were able to observe many strange things happening in the stock market. Including, but not limited to:

* GME spiking in January. It is interesting to note that it held its ground until next day's close even after SHFs were supposedly in control. The few retards back at apes' birthplace that (were actually rich enough and) bought Calls to immediately exercise certainly didn't make a difference.
* GME doing March 10, and still closing slightly up.
* Some stocks did go up with GME, some did go down. (I know that's not a very idiosyncratic statement.)
* u/bananahands linked [an article](https://thelastbearstanding.substack.com/p/the-volatility-squeeze) talking about a ""Volatility Squeeze"" that apparently peaked on February 5.
* Pink sheets and zombies mooning around February 8--10. It should be noted that around that time a window for certain derivatives rollovers opened.
* Pinks following weird volatility patterns, roughly cyclically repeating.
* Smallcaps in general climbing to extreme heights in the first quarter, only to then experience a months-long steady selloff.
* Stocks like PLAN almost perfectly inversing GME for extended periods of time.
* Other stocks like EXPR, KOSS or Shitty Floors (I'd name the symbol, but I resent what it represents) correlating to GME for extended periods of time.
* Some stocks did nothing in January, but at some point started correlating, inversing, preceeding or following GME.
* SHLDQ and BLIAQ doing idiosyncratic things despite being bankrupt for years.
* Many Short Squeezes and Pump &amp; Dumps.

Several posters before me, notably u/BurnieSlander, tried to categorize stocks into baskets, notably those that are commonly known as ""GME basket"" (i.e. EXPR, KOSS, Shitty Floors) and ""SNDL basket"" (Pinks). **It is central to my hypothesis that you imagine that both of these baskets, as well as many other stocks, are part of one and the same.**

Of course, there almost certainly are many different basket swaps and indexes institutions are playing games with or even other market forces (like SLD) at play, so many observations may be coincidental.

This post ignores the ""finance"" side of things, like balance sheets or capital requirements, because I'm too smooth for that shit. The only such thing (that is sometimes ignored in speculative arguments involving GME) I'm not going to ignore is: Every trade not happening on public markets needs a willing counterparty that thinks it can win or requires the product for some other reason.

# The Hypothesis

Normally you'd call this section ""Background"" and explain some stuff. However, me explaining the background spoilers the entire thing, so I'm collapsing into one section. **The examples in this section also demonstrate what I said in my last post about single-name variance versus index variance.**

For a moment, we are going to assume that someone is short the variance of the two hypothetical stocks GME and SNDL in one basket. In the following tables I'm going to show how different price movements impact the single-name variance vs. the basket variance. In all examples, both stocks end up with the same price level that they started with. The examples are simplified to the point that they are wrong from a mathematical standpoint, but that doesn't change the argument (it's just to make it as simple as possible for the smooth brains without alienating the wrinkled ones).

**GME being GME, SNDL staying flat:**

||GME price|GME variance|SNDL price|SNDL variance|Basket price|Basket variance|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Day 1|\+10|\+100|\+0|\+0|\+10|\+100|
|Day 2|\-10|\+100|\+0|\+0|\-10|\+100|
|Day 3|\+0|\+0|\+0|\+0|\+0|\+0|
|Day 4|\+0|\+0|\+0|\+0|\+0|\+0|
|Day 5|\+0|\+0|\+0|\+0|\+0|\+0|
|**Total**|**+0**|**+200**|**+0**|**+0**|**+0**|**+200**|

**GME experiencing a slow selloff, SNDL staying flat:**

||GME price|GME variance|SNDL price|SNDL variance|Basket price|Basket variance|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Day 1|\+10|\+100|\+0|\+0|\+10|\+100|
|Day 2|\-4|\+16|\+0|\+0|\-4|\+16|
|Day 3|\-2|\+4|\+0|\+0|\-2|\+4|
|Day 4|\-2|\+4|\+0|\+0|\-2|\+4|
|Day 5|\-2|\+4|\+0|\+0|\-2|\+4|
|**Total**|**+0**|**+128**|**+0**|**+0**|**+0**|**+128**|

Because of volatility having a quadratic impact on variance, many small changes are less impactful than few large ones.

**GME being GME, SNDL spiking one day later:**

||GME price|GME variance|SNDL price|SNDL variance|Basket price|Basket variance|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Day 1|\+10|\+100|\+0|\+0|\+10|\+100|
|Day 2|\-10|\+100|\+5|\+25|\-5|\+25|
|Day 3|\+0|\+0|\-5|\+25|\-5|\+25|
|Day 4|\+0|\+0|\+0|\+0|\+0|\+0|
|Day 5|\+0|\+0|\+0|\+0|\+0|\+0|
|**Total**|**+0**|**+200**|**+0**|**+50**|**+0**|**+150**|

We can observe that despite SNDL spiking now as well, total basket variance is going down (relative to the first example). This is because the SNDL upwards spike is offsetting GME's downwards spike.

**GME being GME, SNDL dampening even better:**

||GME price|GME variance|SNDL price|SNDL variance|Basket price|Basket variance|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Day 1|\+10|\+100|\+0|\+0|\+10|\+100|
|Day 2|\-10|\+100|\+6|\+36|\-4|\+16|
|Day 3|\+0|\+0|\-2|\+4|\-2|\+4|
|Day 4|\+0|\+0|\-2|\+4|\-2|\+4|
|Day 5|\+0|\+0|\-2|\+4|\-2|\+4|
|**Total**|**+0**|**+200**|**+0**|**+48**|**+0**|**+128**|

**Because small changes in price have a smaller footprint on variance, we can observe that a slow selloff in an idiosyncratic stock or offsetting movements by its constituents both have a similar effect in reducing basket variance.**

It is important here to note that both stocks are hypothetical. The real movements of the actual stocks are too far apart to have this effect. It implies however that with GME's crash other stocks should have spiked---which they apparently did, naming said volatility squeeze. Since that argument is based on VIX, we are talking about the S&amp;P 500 (or parts of it) to offset GME's movements. Because these cannot remain inflated forever, other stocks would have to take over in dampening overall basket movements. Small caps (and hence Pinks) are ideal, because they are less liquid and there's less interest in them. Pinks and especially zombies are dangerous to touch, so other players have an incentive to stay out.

**Combining the things I've hinted at, I am hypothesizing a very broad basket variance swap, potentially packaging thousands of stocks and other instruments from all over the place.** A broad basket like this can easily dampen the effects of some idiosyncratic members through countermovements by their constituents. This doesn't violate the principle of an available counterparty, because a very broad basket would show extremely low volatility, making the VS a suitable hedging vehicle against extreme financial markets turbulence like a stock market crash.

# Idiosyncracies not (yet) covered

Our central hypothesis does not necessarily cover stocks that correlate with GME. VS are often paired with CDS, so maybe the hedging of swaptions can explain some of it (especially relating to zombies). Many of these companies have/had outstanding convertible notes, so maybe there's derivatives written on those causing this stuff. By the way, u/basting_rootwalla found that from the companies that the media before the pandemic pushed as being threatened by bankruptcy the most, they either had gone bankrupt or are now pulling a GME.

However, we so far ignored one important aspect: **It is difficult to get out of a (short) VS.** Assume now a retard with more money than brains (paraphrasing Cohodes' commentary on Melvin---if you haven't, go watch Lucy Komisar's interview, it's pretty cool) that thought it free money to jump on the bankruptcy plays of bigger, more powerful and smarter players and maybe also started selling variance swaps against companies with a touted high chance of bankruptcy. Because, referring to my cheatsheet, a company that you're short volatility/variance on going bankrupt is good for you. So more free money, because this can't go tits up (YMMV).

Back to the fact that you can buy-to-close publicly traded instruments like shares and options, but not VS. Why? Well, for starters, because it's not publicly traded (so no exploiting MMs) and you'd need an even bigger retard to take on that position. Your counterparty might not be willing to let you off the hook just yet or you simply don't have the money, **because that one idiosyncratic spike shot the contract value to deep space**. But more importantly, **you also can't buy a long contract to close this position due to the convexity of the payoff curve** (meaning that the new contract is sitting on the launchpad while the other is moving past Andromeda at high speeds).

I don't know at this time if arbitrage or hedging of such variance spreads (of contracts with different payoff curves) can *cause* correlated movements. **The fact of the matter is that variance spreads in general are related to correlation plays.** By the way, Melvin got his bailout three days before the Toy from Bulgaria screwed over his ""customers"", just incase you're now on the lookout for evidence for the theses mentioned in this section. *(All of this also meaning it's possible he didn't perjure himself when saying he got out. One can speculate that he closed his short shares by giving the bailout right back to Kenny, exercising options and unloading the bag on Citadel Securities, but losing more money later through his short VS positions.)*

However, Melvin's 13F indicates that they seem to have found other hedges, assuming they were in fact short variance.

# Conclusion

We have seen that baskets/indexes can dampen single-name variance by offsetting movements. I hypothesize that this could be used to deliberately offset the effects of GME on VS. This hypothesis can explain, for instance, why GME stayed elevated despite SHFs supposedly being in control, the violent and cyclical movements of other stocks at offsetting times, long and steady selloffs in many different stocks. It doesn't have to, though, and for most of these phenomena many reasons can be found.

I did not explore aspects like capital requirements or the diffculty or viability of pulling this off. I can not explain correlated stocks with this hypothesis. Maybe other products like CDS play a role, or variance spreads are the culprit.

However, this thought experiment illustrates not only how much we are short on research, but also how far we have come as a community in uncovering what is happening to our favourite stonk (and the market as a whole).

All Global Financial Stories Will Start with Evergrande.,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/q5jthq/all_global_financial_stories_will_start_with/,Whole_Shape9055,1,2021-10-11 07:58:13,5,/r/conspiracy/comments/q5jthq/all_global_financial_stories_will_start_with/,NaN,"I have been watching financial markets for a few months now. There was quite the learning curve to catch up with what's been going on. My primary focus has been on the real estate company Evergrande.

**The super short TLDR: The CCP has instituted new rules for financial companies that set three primary rules with regards to company finances. Evergrande immediately was in violation of these rules, specifically one that stated that they could not finance their projects by pre-selling their inventory (read: homes, apartments, other real estate). They has to finance them through traditional funding, such as commercial loans. Since they are in violation, they can not further extend themselves financially. A company that runs a deficit and cannot borrow, will default on their debt and become insolvent.**  

So naturally I‚Äôm now looking for new information, as this is part of my investment strategy. I came across this article.  

[https://www.rfa.org/english/commentaries/china-evergrande-10082021100549.html](https://www.rfa.org/english/commentaries/china-evergrande-10082021100549.html)

It seemed like a pretty informative article. The news source is called Radio Free Asia. This struck me as odd, because if this is a new source based out of Asia and it‚Äôs speaking truth about what is going on in China, why is the CCP allowing that? So I started digging.

This article was written for i-Cable news, a Cantonese cable news channel in Hong Kong. Ok, nothing too surprising there, but when everything seems to be an obfuscation nowadays, I kept looking.  

RFA is the news source here, and it was an article written by someone else. Ok, so who runs RFA? It turns out that RFA is a US government funded 501c3. It is funded and supervised by the US Agency for Global Media. (sourced from wikipedia)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio\_Free\_Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Asia)

Stephen Yates took over as head of the US Agency for Global Media on December 23rd of last year. He was also a former assistant to VP Dick Cheney. Upon his arrival to the USAGM, Stephen Yates fired the heads of the following organizations: RFA, RFE/RL, OCB and MBN. The head of VOA News also resigned at that point in time.

[https://www.voanews.com/a/usa\_radio-free-asia-middle-east-broadcasting-networks-get-new-leaders/6199900.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/usa_radio-free-asia-middle-east-broadcasting-networks-get-new-leaders/6199900.html)

At first I was a little taken aback to find this out, so I started thinking about how RT was Russian state controlled media. I have seen things on RT in the past, that I can now clearly see as Russian propaganda. Obviously I was a little startled to find such a glaring example of the US doing this overseas. How would we feel if the Chinese were doing this to us? Who‚Äôs to say that‚Äôs not already happening?

Could use some more eyes on this. Perhaps there is more than what I‚Äôm seeing."
Front-Run the Long View on Digital Assets,https://www.reddit.com/r/Investments/comments/q5jvo2/frontrun_the_long_view_on_digital_assets/,an_sci,1,2021-10-11 08:01:30,4,/r/Investments/comments/q5jvo2/frontrun_the_long_view_on_digital_assets/,NaN,"In this golden age of FinTech, we are slowly moving to a blockchain-based IT world. 10 years from now will be unrecognizable from today in nearly all fields, but especially banking and payments, IT infrastructure, computing, and personal finance. Whole job markets will be transformed as is happening now. Without a doubt, the creation of Bitcoin in at the end of 2008 was a major driver of these trends and this will only grow stronger. Ethereum‚Äôs introduction in mid 2014 greatly advanced digital asset markets to the explosive innovations happening today in multi-purpose, smart contract protocols.

Many more innovations to come have the potential to reasonably match or even exceed what we‚Äôve seen in Bitcoin and Ether, at least in terms of ROI and uses. Can you identify these start-ups and blockchain initiatives? I urge you to do it now! Do it in a BIG and BOLD way. Front-run the long view. Get ahead of the curve that will transform society in ways that will exceed even the internet age.

To do this right, though, you must first focus on the future uses of the current technologies and tokens that are available. Tune out the noise from social media, blinded advocates, flash-in-the-panners, and cut-and-paste slang and mindless code-speak (‚Äúnot your keys‚Ä¶.; DYOR). Also remember the key fact that nearly all of the variation in ROI (90%+) is due to coin selection and not logistics or strategies like transaction costs, DEFI vs. CEFI, which exchange, or allocation percentage. 

These things in the long view are trivial, and typical investors spend way too much time on them. They are losing the big picture and the lifetime opportunity of the FinTech golden age. Also lost is the most important asset there will ever be: Time!

Picking the ‚Äúright‚Äù coins as investments is the only factor worth considering. Be bold but be right! And BOLD means INVEST ALL or NEARLY ALL INVESTABLE ASSETS in your chosen coins (only a few). This plan is not for the timid, and if you don‚Äôt want to take the risk, don‚Äôt. You will be giving up the chance to make the highest ROI possible and it may be unimaginably large. 

However, life is not about ROI but OLS (overall life satisfaction). Of course, the younger you are the more rational it is to INVEST ALL or NEARLY ALL because you have time to recoup if necessary. Alternatively, older people are usually wiser; thus are more likely to select the coins that have the highest potential ROI. Age should not dissuade. Moreover, platforms like Nexo Finance, Aave, Celsius Network, which did not exist 4 years ago, are ready-made to implement an INVEST ALL strategy

Some people actually did invest EARLY ON all they had for BTC and ETH. They sold their houses and cars, cashed out whatever accounts they had, including retirement funds (and would have if available), and borrowed whatever possible . ALL or close to it was bet big because of the future world they saw. 

So what happened if you were smart and lucky enough to do this?

¬∑ Since the public sale in July 2014, ETH is up 12,000X. The sale was open to everyone on a website and you could have bought ETH for 30 cents in exchange for BTC (that was the only option). This is a clear message that timid investors often lose.

¬∑ During this same period, BTC is up 89X. This is fabulous, but you were more than handsomely rewarded in exchanging for ETH at the time.

¬∑ Over its entire history, though, nothing can touch BTC. It is up 1.1mX (yes 1,102,000X) since it was first available to purchase on an exchange for 5 cents in 2010. This ROI has never been matched by any other investment and probably never will be. It is a standard and utopia to strive for.

The lesson: Be bold--maybe even borderline crazy bold--think big, and you may be right. And for many people, it is worth seriously considering and trying. The record from BTC and ETH provides ample evidence of the potential payoff.  For the INVEST ALL or NEARLY ALL IN approach to work, the ROI does not have to be 12,000X or 100X. Even at 5X over the next 5 years, you‚Äôll beat nearly any other traditional investment opportunity by a lot. The yearly return of the S&amp;P 500 over many decades is 7%.

A few years ago, I certainly studied all the available evidence and the FinTech transformations that were beginning to occur and invested NEARLY ALL assets. Over a short period of time, I sold my entire stock holdings of Apple, Google, Microsoft, and ETFs; cashed out a sizable percentage of retirement funds; maxed out on any and every possible loan product, and leveraged both stock and crypto lending accounts to a moderate degree, but never touched or considered derivatives and options. Over 90% of my investable assets were moved to digital and this percentage may increase to 95%+ in the future. The ROI has been much higher than the investments I gave up but not up to Ether‚Äôs original return. Looking back, I could have been even bolder. Time and continuing FinTech advances are on my side.

The 100X-1000X question is what are the coins and digital assets available now that can, to a large extent, approach the gains seen over the years in BTC and ETH? The goal is sustainable gains many years and decades into the future. Which particular start-up and blockchain initiatives are most likely to have critical roles in transforming society to the new IT-blockchain frontier that will become the reality?

Ignore the 3-month to 1-year gains from many new tokens (NFT related and others) that surely will not be sustained over 3- to 5-years let alone decades. Betting on the trendy tokens with no track record and little if any use should be avoided. Below are a few categories of possibilities to select a few among them with a caution that a basket or ETF-style approach is not a bold, high-return strategy since one would be averaging gains across bad, mediocre, good, and great bets. My belief is that there are more BTC and ETH sized gains out there that will have outsized roles in the coming digital age. A pure focus on this possibility is more than worth the effort.

¬∑ **Store of value**. BTC, as digital gold, is the absolute king. There is nothing close to this currently but ETH and to a lesser extent Litecoin could be of interest.

¬∑ **Level 1 blockchains (multipurpose)**. Although ETH is the clear favorite and may continue the remarkable past gains, new and established chains are making a big difference, including Cardano, DOT, Cosmos, Solana, Avalanche, and Tezos. There is room for many to co-exist but can any get to ETH‚Äôs level and ROI? At least one of these (or others) are good bets.

¬∑ **DEFI**. The movement to transform banking and FinTech is only beginning and there are likely to be huge winners here. Curve Finance, Aave, Uniswap, Compound, Maker, Balancer, Yearn Finance, Synthetix, and Harvest Finance are the most notable and continue to grow. Off-the-beaten-path tokens are worth considering and researching. You will very likely see M&amp;A activity with traditional banks and financial institutions. Paypal‚Äôs purchase of Curve Finance is the first of many to come.

¬∑ **CEFI**. There is no shortage of centralized lending start-ups that also have vast earnings products for consumers. Nexo Finance, Celsius Network, BlockFi, Crypto.com, Voyager, Hodlnaut, and new networks seem to be coming online every week. Lending and earnings options are only going to grow but traditional banks will bring major competition over the next 5 years. Greater regulation will be here very soon. This category is an unlikely 100x from current levels. There are likely to be a few big winners. 

¬∑ **Exchange tokens**. Binance‚Äôs BNB is a top choice along with FTX, Kucoin, and Huobi. Like CEFI, the giant gains one is looking for are difficult to see. The coming regulations could also restrict growth.

¬∑ **Payments**. This area is increasing but without the big growth as seen in DEFI. BTC, Eth, Doge Coin, Monero, DASH, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin are the main chains used today. The problem of course is the expected inverse relationship between ROI and payments.

¬∑ **Cross-border payments and the unbanked**. Stellar‚Äôs XLM and Ripple‚Äôs XRP seem to dominant here with real use cases. XLM, in particular, is focused on reducing unbanked populations in the developing world. This is a signature goal for all of digital assets.  Both start ups can transfer payments near instantly and securely. The SEC case against Ripple may end sooner than expected.

¬∑ **Other**. Emerging areas with many new protocols and start-up are in AI, NFTs, storage, oracles and data services, internet of things, tipping, and all sorts of utilities. These could be among the greatest innovations of the next decade and with the highest ROIs. Deep dives are required to make the best choices and to benefit from luck. A partial list includes LINK, BAND, Fetch.ai, COTI, AXS, IOST, Storj, and Siacoin. Also investigate the tokens listed on Coinbase. They‚Äôve done due diligence checks for you.

A long story short. From my perspective, the best bets are as follows and they are few given the desire for the highest possible ROI and the impossibility of fully understanding more than a handful of initiatives of which to invest with good enough evidence. Limiting to three and a great reward/risk ratio, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Stellar are hard to beat. With the highest potential return, Stellar is a higher risk worth taking. For ROI, it is my first choice. 

The fundamental goal of the BTC-inspired decentralized finance movement of the past decade is that everyone, no matter where they live or the amount of resources they have, must have access to financial services that are easy to use, efficient, borderless, and does not require trusted third parties. My choices don‚Äôt have to be your choices. But be bold, and you really can be right.

Also remember the key fact that nearly all of the variation in ROI (90%+) is due to coin selection and not logistics or strategies like transaction costs, DEFI vs. CEFI, which exchange, or allocation percentage. 

These things in the long view are trivial, and typical investors spend way too much time on them. They are losing the big picture and the lifetime opportunity of the FinTech golden age. Also lost is the most important asset there will ever be: Time!

Picking the ‚Äúright‚Äù coins as investments is the only factor worth considering. Be bold but be right! And BOLD means INVEST ALL or NEARLY ALL INVESTABLE ASSETS in your chosen coins (only a few). This plan is not for the timid, and if you don‚Äôt want to take the risk, don‚Äôt. You will be giving up the chance to make the highest ROI possible and it may be unimaginably large. 

However, life is not about ROI but OLS (overall life satisfaction). Of course, the younger you are the more rational it is to INVEST ALL or NEARLY ALL because you have time to recoup if necessary. Alternatively, older people are usually wiser; thus are more likely to select the coins that have the highest potential ROI. Age should not dissuade. Moreover, platforms like Nexo Finance, Aave, and Celsius Network, which did not exist 4 years ago, are ready-made to implement an INVEST ALL strategy.

Some people actually did invest EARLY ON all they had for BTC and ETH. They sold their houses and cars, cashed out whatever accounts they had, including retirement funds (and would have if available), and borrowed whatever possible. ALL or close to it was bet big because of the future world they saw. 

So what happened if you were smart and lucky enough to do this?

¬∑ Since the public sale in July 2014, ETH is up 12,000X. The sale was open to everyone on a website and you could have bought ETH for 30 cents in exchange for BTC (that was the only option). This is a clear message that timid investors often lose.

¬∑ During this same period, BTC is up 89X. This is fabulous, but you were more than handsomely rewarded in exchanging for ETH at the time.

¬∑ Over its entire history, though, nothing can touch BTC. It is up 1.1mX (yes 1,102,000X) since it was first available to purchase on an exchange for 5 cents in 2010. This ROI has never been matched by any other investment and probably never will be. It is a standard and utopia to strive for.

The lesson: Be bold--maybe even borderline crazy bold--think big, and you may be right. And for many people, it is worth seriously considering and trying. The record from BTC and ETH provides ample evidence of the potential payoff.  For the INVEST ALL or NEARLY ALL IN approach to work, the ROI does not have to be 12,000X or 100X. Even at 5X over the next 5 years, you‚Äôll beat nearly any other traditional investment opportunity by a lot. The yearly return of the S&amp;P 500 over many decades is 7%.

A few years ago, I certainly studied all the available evidence and the FinTech transformations that were beginning to occur and invested NEARLY ALL assets. Over a short period of time, I sold my entire stock holdings of Apple, Google, Microsoft, and ETFs; cashed out a sizable percentage of retirement funds; maxed out on any and every possible loan product, and leveraged both stock and crypto lending accounts to a moderate degree, but never touched or considered derivatives and options. Over 90% of my investable assets were moved to digital and this percentage may increase to 95%+ in the future. The ROI has been much higher than the investments I gave up but not up to Ether‚Äôs original return. Looking back, I could have been even bolder. Time and continuing FinTech advances are on my side.

The 100X-1000X question is what are the coins and digital assets available now that can, to a large extent, approach the gains seen over the years in BTC and ETH? The goal is sustainable gains many years and decades into the future. Which particular start-up and blockchain initiatives are most likely to have critical roles in transforming society to the new IT-blockchain frontier that will become the reality?

Ignore the 3-month to 1-year gains from many new tokens (NFT related and others) that surely will not be sustained over 3- to 5-years let alone decades. Betting on the trendy tokens with no track record and little if any use should be avoided. Below are a few categories of possibilities to select a few among them with a caution that a basket or ETF-style approach is not a bold, high-return strategy since one would be averaging gains across bad, mediocre, good, and great bets. My belief is that there are more BTC and ETH sized gains out there that will have outsized roles in the coming digital age. A pure focus on this possibility is more than worth the effort.

¬∑ **Store of value**. BTC, as digital gold, is the absolute king. There is nothing close to this currently but ETH and to a lesser extent Litecoin could be of interest.

¬∑ **Level 1 blockchains (multipurpose)**. Although ETH is the clear favorite and may continue the remarkable past gains, new and established chains are making a big difference, including Cardano, DOT, Cosmos, Solana, Avalanche, and Tezos. There is room for many to co-exist but can any get to ETH‚Äôs level and ROI? At least one of these (or others) are good bets.

¬∑ **DEFI**. The movement to transform banking and FinTech is only beginning and there are likely to be huge winners here. Curve Finance, Aave, Uniswap, Compound, Maker, Balancer, Yearn Finance, Synthetix, and Harvest Finance are the most notable and continue to grow. Off-the-beaten-path tokens are worth considering and researching. You will very likely see M&amp;A activity with traditional banks and financial institutions. Paypal‚Äôs purchase of Curve Finance is the first of many to come.

¬∑ **CEFI**. There is no shortage of centralized lending start-ups that also have vast earnings products for consumers. Nexo Finance, Celsius Network, BlockFi, Crypto.com, Voyager, Hodlnaut, and new networks seem to be coming online every week. Lending and earnings options are only going to grow but traditional banks will bring major competition over the next 5 years. Greater regulation will be here very soon. This category is an unlikely 100x from current levels. There are likely to be a few big winners. 

¬∑ **Exchange tokens**. Binance‚Äôs BNB is a top choice along with FTX, Kucoin, and Huobi. Like CEFI, the giant gains one is looking for are difficult to see. The coming regulations could also restrict growth.

¬∑ **Payments**. This area is increasing but without the big growth as seen in DEFI. BTC, Eth, Doge Coin, Monero, DASH, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin are the main chains used today. The problem of course is the expected inverse relationship between ROI and payments.

¬∑ **Cross-border payments and the unbanked**. Stellar‚Äôs XLM and Ripple‚Äôs XRP seem to dominant here with real use cases. XLM, in particular, is focused on reducing unbanked populations in the developing world. This is a signature goal for all of digital assets.  Both start ups can transfer payments near instantly and securely. The SEC case against Ripple may end sooner than expected.

¬∑ **Other**. Emerging areas with many new protocols and start-up are in AI, NFTs, storage, oracles and data services, internet of things, tipping, and all sorts of utilities. These could be among the greatest innovations of the next decade and with the highest ROIs. Deep dives are required to make the best choices and to benefit from luck. A partial list includes LINK, BAND, Fetch.ai, COTI, AXS, IOST, Storj, and Siacoin. Also investigate the tokens listed on Coinbase. They‚Äôve done due diligence checks for you.

A long story short. From my perspective, the best bets are as follows and they are few given the desire for the highest possible ROI and the impossibility of fully understanding more than a handful of initiatives of which to invest with good enough evidence. Limiting to three and a great reward/risk ratio, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Stellar are hard to beat. With the highest potential return, Stellar is a higher risk worth taking. For ROI, it is my first choice. 

The fundamental goal of the BTC-inspired decentralized finance movement of the past decade is that everyone, no matter where they live or the amount of resources they have, must have access to financial services that are easy to use, efficient, borderless, and does not require trusted third parties. My choices don‚Äôt have to be your choices. But be bold, and you really can be right.

# 1. Bitcoin Makes a Push for $57K as Fed Taper Fears Linger, Leveraged Funds Boost Shorts

&gt;***The positive sentiment in BTC has been partially driven by ETF speculation.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Bitcoin jumped to a fresh five-month high early Monday, extending the two-week price rally even though Friday‚Äôs weak U.S. jobs report failed to dampen expectations for Federal Reserve (Fed) tapering in November. The market also turned a blind eye toward the data showing supposedly bearish positioning by leveraged funds in the futures market.  
The cryptocurrency rose to $57,000 during the early European hours, hitting the highest since mid-May. Prices rose 13% in the week ended Oct. 10, registering its second straight double-digit weekly gain.  
Bitcoin‚Äôs continued resilience to usually bearish macro factors could be attributed to improved prospects of the U.S. approving a futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) this month.  
‚ÄúThe positive sentiment in BTC has been partially driven by the expectations of a potential approval for a futures-based Bitcoin ETF in the near future. Other factors contributing to the rise include continued inflows from institutional investors and SEC chairman Gary Gensler telling Congress that the agency has no plans to ban crypto,‚Äù Coinbase Institutional said in its weekly email.  
The U.S. jobs data, which released on Friday, showed Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 in September, compared to the Dow Jones estimate of 500,000. However, the jobless rate dropped to an 18-month low of 4.9%, keeping the Fed on track to begin unwinding the crisis-era stimulus from November and lift interest rates by mid-2022.  
‚ÄúFriday‚Äôs headline NFP jobs miss has done little to dampen Fed tapering/tightening expectations. For example, Dec 2023 Euro-dollar futures continue to break lower, consistent with the recent trend of the market re-pricing the U.S. interest rate curve towards Fed projections in the September Dot Plots. This is dollar bullish,‚Äù ING analysts noted in the daily market analysis.  
Recent reports of Soros Foundation gaining exposure to bitcoin and U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs disclosure of bitcoin purchases may have also added to the bullish sentiment.  
The Commitments of Traders (COT) report published by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday revealed that hedge funds and various types of money managers that, in effect, borrow money to trade ‚Äî increased their short positions from 18,000 to 22,000 in the week ended Oct. 5.  
The uptick does not necessarily represent outright short positioning and could have stemmed from renewed interest in cash and carry arbitrage strategy. The method involves buying the asset on the spot market and taking a sell position in the futures market when the latter is trading at a significant premium to the spot price. Futures prices converge with spot prices on the expiry day, giving a risk-free return to a carry trader.  
The premium on the CME-based front-month futures rose from an annualized 1.5% to nearly 12% in the seven days to Oct. 5, according to data provided by Skew.  
While bitcoin appears to be on a strong footing, some investors anticipate a temporary price pullback. The one-week put-call skew has turned positive, reflecting demand for short-term downside protection or put options.

# 2. Ex-UK Chancellor Philip Hammond Joins Crypto Custodian Copper in Advisory Role

&gt;***Hammond will provide strategic advice to the company‚Äôs global expansion efforts.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Former U.K. Chancellor Philip Hammond has joined crypto infrastructure provider Copper as a senior adviser.  
Now a member of the House of Lords, the former chancellor will provide strategic advice to the company‚Äôs global expansion efforts, Copper announced Monday.  
Hammond served under Prime Ministers David Cameron and Theresa May from 2010 to 2019, including three years as chancellor and two as foreign secretary.  
Copper, which says it has over 400 institutional clients, raised $25 million led by hedge fund manager Alan Howard in June supplementing the $50 million Series B funding round of a month earlier co-led by Dawn Capital and Target Global.

# 3. ConsenSys Holds Funding Round Talks With $3B Valuation

&gt;***The New York-based firm raised $65 million in April from financial giants such as JPMorgan and Mastercard.***  
&gt;  
&gt;ConsenSys, a blockchain company that develops and invests in Ethereum-based projects, is in talks about a funding round that would value the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based company at $3 billion, according to three people familiar with the discussions.  
The company is looking to raise $250 million, one of the people said.  
‚ÄúGolden Tree Asset Management and probably Arca are in the round,‚Äù the person said.  
Golden Tree declined to comment, and Arca did not respond to an email sent before U.S. office hours.  
ConsenSys raised $65 million in April this year from financial giants such as JPMorgan, Mastercard and UBS as well as leading decentralized finance (DeFi) companies.  
As a developer and supporter of projects built on Ethereum, ConsenSys has pivoted away from consulting and services toward a larger focus on products.  
ConsenSys is the developer of MetaMask, for example ‚Äî a key gateway to the DeFi world ‚Äî which has facilitated more than $9 billion of trade through its digital token swap feature.  
The Financial Times reported the funding round earlier, citing people who had been briefed about the plans.

# 4. US Nuclear Engineer, Wife Charged Over Sale of Naval Secrets for Crypto

&gt;***The pair had received $100,000 in monero before they were arrested by the FBI and NCIS, according to the criminal complaint.***  
&gt;  
&gt;A nuclear engineer employed by the Department of the Navy and his wife have been charged with attempting to sell restricted data to an undercover government agent in exchange for the privacy-centric crypto monero.  
According to a criminal complaint filed Friday by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Jonathan and Diana Toebbe, both of Maryland, had been engaged in a conspiracy to sell information relating to the design of U.S. nuclear submarines to a foreign nation, referred to as COUNTRY1 in the complaint and supporting affidavit.  
Jonathan Toebbe, an engineer assigned to the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program, held an active national security clearance through the U.S. Department of Defense, which afforded him access to sensitive information. The charge alleges the pair violated the Atomic Energy Act. The act prohibits the communication, transmission, or disclosure of restricted nuclear data with the intent to injure the U.S. or to secure an advantage to any foreign nation.  
The use of crypto as payment in a case with national security implications could embolden regulators and members of congress who argue for curbs on crypto due to what they say is its prevalence in facilitating illegal activity.  
On April 1, 2020, according to the affidavit, Jonathan Toebbe sent a package containing a sample of restricted data to a foreign government in a bid to establish a relationship to purchase additional sensitive information. The complaint also alleges Toebbe began corresponding via encrypted email with an individual whom he believed to be a representative of the foreign government.  
Toebbe and his wife, Diana Toebbe, attempted to sell the restricted data on three occasions from June 8 to Oct. 9, 2021, according the the complaint.  
Unbeknownst to the Toebbe‚Äôs, the pair met with an undercover agent on three separate occasions and handed over restricted documents, including encrypted data loaded onto SD cards concealed in a chewing gum packet and half a peanut butter sandwich. A review of the SD cards revealed that they contained restricted data related to submarine nuclear reactors.  
The Toebbes had received a total of $100,000 in monero before they were arrested by the FBI and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service in West Virginia on Saturday, the complaint reads.

# 5. Texas should use Bitcoin mining to capture wasted natural gas

&gt;***Senator Cruz predicts that Bitcoin mining will be used to capture wasted renewables and Texas‚Äô power grid within five years.***  
&gt;  
&gt;United States Senator Ted Cruz believes that his country should be using natural gas to mine Bitcoin (BTC) instead of flaring it.  
Speaking during Friday‚Äôs Texas Blockchain Summit, Senator Cruz asserted that Bitcoin mining can be used to monetize energy created through oil and gas extraction rather than burning it, arguing that there is ‚Äúenormous opportunity for Bitcoin \[‚Ä¶\] to capture that gas instead of wasting it.‚Äù  
According to a transcription of the talk shared to social media by Coin Metrics founder Nic Carter, Cruz noted that half of the natural gas flared in the country is currently being burned in West Texas. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs being wasted because there is no transmission equipment to get that natural gas where it could be used the way natural gas would ordinarily be employed,‚Äù he added.  
‚ÄúUse that power to mine Bitcoin. Part of the beauty of that is the instant you‚Äôre doing it you‚Äôre helping the environment enormously because rather than flaring the natural gas you‚Äôre putting it to productive use.‚Äù  
Cruz emphasized the capacity for Bitcoin mining to be mobilized reflexively in response to fluctuating energy supply, stating that energy could be immediately returned to the grid in the event of a sudden power outage or shortage.  
‚ÄúIn five years, I expect to see a dramatically different terrain, with Bitcoin mining playing a significant role in strengthening and hardening the resilience of the grid,‚Äù he added.  
Cruz noted that Bitcoin can be used to capture unutilized energy across the globe, arguing, ‚ÄúThere are a lot of places on Earth where the sun shines a lot and the wind blows a lot, but there aren‚Äôt any power lines, and it‚Äôs not economically feasible to use that energy.‚Äù  
‚ÄúThe beauty of Bitcoin mining is that if you can connect to the internet, you can use that energy and derive value from those renewables in a way that would be impossible otherwise.‚Äù  
Cruz is not alone in believing Bitcoin mining could offer an efficient means to capture renewable energy, with El Salvador recently announcing plans for a state-backed Bitcoin mining project powered by renewables.

Every single one of us comes from different backgrounds and are at different stages in our individual lives. Some of us have a family that are relying on us, some of us are sacrificing everything because they believe in this movement, some of us are sleeping in their cars and have no roof over their heads'. 

I want every single fucking one of you to look at yourself in the mirror and smile. Smile because whether this mother rockets or not, appreciate what each and every one of us have achieved. We've learned the markets, the fuckery, doctorate level finance, and most importantly, each one of us have transcended from diamond hands to pure diamond balls. Yes, even you apettes. 

With all of the things that are going against individuals like us, we collectively came together, at first for life changing tendies, but now battle-hardened and defending the livelihoods of every single person who has a 401k, Roth IRA, and who cannot retire after a life time of work due to the pure manipulation in the markets.

Look at the pure growth each and every one of us has experienced during a short tenure. Many of us have found faith in humanity, faith in numbers and a belief so strong that no amount of fuckery can lead us astray.

I am so thankful for every single one of you - The challenges, curve balls and perseverance we have endured has been nothing but beautiful. You all are an example of collective perseverance and faith. Every person reading this, I absolutely love you and I am so grateful that we have found each other. We will see this through and on the other side I have no doubt that we will change the life of every person around us for the better. 

Collectively, the conclusion has already been written. 

RC if you are reading this, we believe in you and we believe that you chose to lead this company for a reason, the same reason each one of us have invested in GameStop, a change for the better and to overcome challenges.

DFV, I don't know you, but I respect you. Whether you wanted it or not, you have effected the lives of every single person in this sub. You were the reason I invested in GME and I can never thank you enough for leading me on this incredible journey."

Safe place to deposit stablecoins for high yields?,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBetsCrypto/comments/q65hbg/safe_place_to_deposit_stablecoins_for_high_yields/,brian2707,1,2021-10-12 04:51:43,36,/r/WallStreetBetsCrypto/comments/q65hbg/safe_place_to_deposit_stablecoins_for_high_yields/,Discussion,"Hey guys, I believe holding stablecoins and earning stable yields (5-25% is very doable) is a very important part of a portfolio strategy. Where do you guys deposit stablecoins to earn yield?

On deciding where to deposit, I think most look for security. Reassuring places might be large CeDeFi entities like Celsius, BlockFi, or Coinbase, where you can earn 8.9%, 7.5%, and 4% interest, respectively. Next might be old-name DeFi platforms, like Aave (2%), Compound (4%), Yearn (8%), or Curve (8% in CRV rewards). But, Ethereum has high fees and Yearn has been exploited before.

Of all the protocols I‚Äôve researched, I think Alpaca Finance on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) offers really high yields, while still being secure and trusted. In their lending pools, you can deposit USDT, BUSD, or TUSD for pretty high yields (10-20%). Even though BSC has a bad rep, Alpaca Finance is different. They are a blue-chip protocol and leader in leveraged yield farming across all DeFi chains. They have $1.6B in TVL, 11 audits on their smart contracts, and developed many of their own security measures, such as time-locked contracts and an Oracle Guard. If you visit their [Docs](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/), you can see the sheer amount of information and transparency they provide. It‚Äôs much more than other protocols. From their well-designed user interface and NFT campaigns, you can see how serious they are about their product.

How does Alpaca give you such high interest rates in their lending pools? Well, the borrowers are people who take undercollateralized loans to leverage up their farming positions. Because the loans are undercollateralized and yield farming is fairly profitable, the borrowers are willing to pay a high interest rate. Very little of the APR given out by Alpaca Finance is in their farming token, ALPACA&lt; meaning the yields are sustainable for years to come.

Finally, you can also earn very high stablecoin yields by leveraged farming their stablecoin-stablecoin farms. For example, you can deposit $10k USDT into a USDT-BUSD farm on Alpaca Finance. Then, you can borrow up to $50k BUSD (6x leverage) and earn yield the combined total of $60k. It‚Äôs a little bit like Aave, where users deposit stablecoins, borrow stablecoins, and repeat, so they are essentially leveraged up on stablecoins while capturing yield on a 6-10x leveraged principle. But, the difference is Alpaca Finance 1) does this in one easy step for you and 2) routes your stablecoins to providing liquidity on AMMs, which is more profitable than borrowing/lending (Aave, Compound). Thus, you can get 20-50% yields (right now it‚Äôs at 30%).

Anyway, let me know what you guys think. Feel free to ask me anything about leveraged farming or DeFi in general. I just want to spread the word that you can still profit by just holding stablecoins, no need to ape everything into volatile crypto assets."

Ideas for a research question!,https://www.reddit.com/r/econometrics/comments/q81myf/ideas_for_a_research_question/,usernameincomplet_,1,2021-10-14 23:08:17,2,/r/econometrics/comments/q81myf/ideas_for_a_research_question/,NaN,"Hey guys, I have just started an introductory course in econometrics and data science. My exam is an assignment that I have to complete in a month. I'm kinda clueless as to where to begin, which classical theory's to use etc . 

The assignment is as below:
1. Choose an economic or financial theory in which to operate
2. Derive a research question underpinned by data
3. Analyse the research question
4. Work with classical econometric modem in R to answer the research question

Examples:
Research question : Why does low unemployment no longer lift inflation? 
The theory used: Philips Curve

Another example: a student collected data from Yahoo finance and POIZON. He then proved that sneaker transactions have a negative influence on the stock market. Then he used rational bubble theory model to build a theoretical model, and also used the right-tailed unit root test and the double recursive  regression test to build an econometrics model for analysing the market risk of sneakers.


Please suggest any models/research question so I can get started! I'm totally clueless and would appreciate any insight on how to get started!"

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.
* I can provide quick notifications and updates of progress made in the student's class via email | text | phone calls.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.

* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.

* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROOF OF MY EXPERTISE IN ACADEMIC WORK:**

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.
* I can provide quick notifications and updates of progress made in the student's class via email | text | phone calls.
* I can also be available to tutor students for Fall 2021 | Spring 2022 | Summer 2022 semesters.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE OF EXPERTISE:**

* I am very knowledgeable and well-versed in a wide range of educational software to tutor students in including but not limited to: Acellus | ALEKS |APEX Learning | Aplia | Blackboard | Brightspace | Canvas | Cengage | CengageNow | Connect | ConnectMath | Connexus | CPM | D2L | Discord | Edmentum | Eviews | Examity | Excel | Hawkes Learning | Honorlock | Khan Academy | Knewton | LimeSpring | Lumen | Maple | MasteringChemistry | MasteringPhysics | MathXL (XL) | MATLAB | McGraw-Hill | Microsoft Word | Minitab | Moodle | MyAccountingLab | MyEconLab | MyITLab | MyLab | My Lab | MyMathLab | My Math Lab | MyOpenMath | MyPsychLab | MySocLab | MyStatLab | My Stat Lab | NCSS | Open Source Software | Pearson | PERT | PlatoWeb | PowerPoint | Prezi | R | Respondus Lockdown Browser with Webcam | Sapling | SPSS | Stata | StraighterLine | Straighter Line | WebAssign | Web Assign |Webex (Cisco) | WebWork | Wiley | WileyPlus | Wonderlic | Zoom

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.

* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.
* I am quite skilled and adept in using multiple modernized educational platforms and software, including but not limited to: Brightspace | MyStatLab | D2L | WebAssign | Canvas | MyMathLab | Blackboard | ALEKS
* Can format term papers and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Harvard | Chicago | Vancouver | OSCOLA | IEEE format.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROOF OF MY EXPERTISE IN ACADEMIC WORK:**

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROOF OF MY EXPERTISE IN ACADEMIC WORK:**

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

* Can format term papers and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Harvard | Chicago | Vancouver | OSCOLA | IEEE format.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROOF OF MY EXPERTISE IN ACADEMIC WORK:**

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.

And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROOF OF MY EXPERTISE IN ACADEMIC WORK:**

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE OF EXPERTISE:**

* I am very knowledgeable and well-versed in a wide range of educational software to tutor students in including but not limited to: Acellus | ALEKS |APEX Learning | Aplia | Blackboard | Brightspace | Canvas | Cengage | CengageNow | Connect | ConnectMath | Connexus | CPM | D2L | Discord | Edmentum | Eviews | Examity | Excel | Hawkes Learning | Honorlock | Khan Academy | Knewton | LimeSpring | Lumen | Maple | MasteringChemistry | MasteringPhysics | MathXL (XL) | MATLAB | McGraw-Hill | Microsoft Word | Minitab | Moodle | MyAccountingLab | MyEconLab | MyITLab | MyLab | My Lab | MyMathLab | My Math Lab | MyOpenMath | MyPsychLab | MySocLab | MyStatLab | My Stat Lab | NCSS | Open Source Software | Pearson | PERT | PlatoWeb | PowerPoint | Prezi | R | Respondus Lockdown Browser with Webcam | Sapling | SPSS | Stata | StraighterLine | Straighter Line | WebAssign | Web Assign |Webex (Cisco) | WebWork | Wiley | WileyPlus | Wonderlic | Zoom

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.
* I am quite skilled and adept in using multiple modernized educational platforms and software, including but not limited to: Brightspace | MyStatLab | D2L | WebAssign | Canvas | MyMathLab | Blackboard | ALEKS
* Can format term papers and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Harvard | Chicago | Vancouver | OSCOLA | IEEE format.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROOF OF MY EXPERTISE IN ACADEMIC WORK:**

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.
* I am quite skilled and adept in using multiple modernized educational platforms and software, including but not limited to: Brightspace | MyStatLab | D2L | WebAssign | Canvas | MyMathLab | Blackboard | ALEKS
* Can format term papers and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Harvard | Chicago | Vancouver | OSCOLA | IEEE format.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROOF OF MY EXPERTISE IN ACADEMIC WORK:**

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

* Can format term papers and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Harvard | Chicago | Vancouver | OSCOLA | IEEE format.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROOF OF MY EXPERTISE IN ACADEMIC WORK:**

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROOF OF MY EXPERTISE IN ACADEMIC WORK:**

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

* I am very knowledgeable and well-versed in a wide range of educational software to tutor students in including but not limited to: Acellus | ALEKS |APEX Learning | Aplia | Blackboard | Brightspace | Canvas | Cengage | CengageNow | Connect | ConnectMath | Connexus | CPM | D2L | Discord | Edmentum | Eviews | Examity | Excel | Hawkes Learning | Honorlock | Khan Academy | Knewton | LimeSpring | Lumen | Maple | MasteringChemistry | MasteringPhysics | MathXL (XL) | MATLAB | McGraw-Hill | Microsoft Word | Minitab | Moodle | MyAccountingLab | MyEconLab | MyITLab | MyLab | My Lab | MyMathLab | My Math Lab | MyOpenMath | MyPsychLab | MySocLab | MyStatLab | My Stat Lab | NCSS | Open Source Software | Pearson | PERT | PlatoWeb | PowerPoint | Prezi | R | Respondus Lockdown Browser with Webcam | Sapling | SPSS | Stata | StraighterLine | Straighter Line | WebAssign | Web Assign |Webex (Cisco) | WebWork | Wiley | WileyPlus | Wonderlic | Zoom

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.

* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.
* I can provide quick notifications and updates of progress made in the student's class via email | text | phone calls.
* I can also be available to tutor students for Fall 2021 | Spring 2022 | Summer 2022 semesters.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.¬†
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.¬†
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.¬†
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.¬†
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.¬†
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person.¬†Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people.¬†Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.¬† This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.¬†
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded.¬†If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.¬† Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

It isn‚Äôt very often that investors get the opportunity to dabble in early-stage investments in neobanks. However, fintech investing has, early with PayPal until the present day with Coinbase and Chime, given the average Joe a peek into multi-bagger investment territory. So who are the Canadian players in this new Fintech future where banking is done through an app and crypto is part of your financial arsenal?

Outside of Silicon Valley, Canada‚Äôs RevoluGROUP has slid under the proverbial radar while accruing essential financial licenses over the past year or so. Almost as if REVO  CEO Steve Marshall could channel Forbes from 2014. 

The array of licenses now granted to REVO appears a carbon copy of the world‚Äôs largest remittance countries. The Company attained the 27 countries European PSD2 license in 2020. In December 2020, the Company acquired the Canadian FINTRAC license, and in October 2021, the all-important U.S. FINCEN License. This textbook global licensing profile leaves just UAE. But, of course, RevoluGROUP has petitioned that license and is awaiting a reply from Dubai's DFSA Financial regulator.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rluksvozumt71.png?width=489&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ba0a8063ea69afdee30bd10f212b464a5f62b2a

Why is RevoluGROUP still only valued at around 50 million CA$? Simple.  The Company recently began flexing its banking licensed muscles; its provenance is impressive. 

BBVA Bank, U.S. banking goliath PNC, Flutterwave, and Thunes have signed up for the Company's financial technology. Last month, Europe's [ProSEGUR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSG.MC/), a CA$2.4 billion publicly listed (Madrid) company, too little fanfare, launched [Sendity](https://sendity.com/) using both RevoluGROUP‚Äôs banking licenses and technology. 

A few months earlier, [Million Bridges](https://millionbridges.com/) backed by the Red Cross and the U.N. Crisis fund also signed with RevoluGROUP to bring humanitarian financial aid into war-torn Lebanon. RevoluGROUP intends to sit in the middle of virtually any vast global economic activity opportunities that might arise.

In an impressive and likely profitable example of what REVO can do in the crypto space, it quietly launched a [crypto](https://www.revoluex.com/) to the fiat exchange platform. As a licensed bank, REVO may be the first to offer a genuine regulatory-backed exchange to some of the world's largest crypto exchanges who as yet haven't been able to gain banking licenses. The Company's recent news alludes to Huobi and Dsdaq, both churning billions a day in volume and both currently courting with RevoluGROUP for a slice of their banking ability as a way to legitimize the crypto to fiat offramps.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4f3lmic2vmt71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be6810a432f78200387bc8ca8474430841846b77

Much impressive water has quietly flowed under the REVO bridge. REVO deepens its offerings constantly. And no wonder; the Global app-based banking market is massive and growing. Mobile-based banking systems delivering speed and efficiency must be the norm and provide state-of-the-art financial/payment services to the 'unbanked.

Among the unique initiatives RevoluGROUP has undertaken are first, the Apple and Android phone-based banking app with Visa Card is 100% proprietary: REVO owns the entire source code. Second, they're self-licensed. Finally, as previously stated, through its RevoluPAY division, REVO has its banking backing this impressive 100% owned technology. 

Uniquely, RevoluGROUP has been bold in the white label licensing of its **technology AND financial licenses**. As a result, the Company has accrued an impressive number of users, and cash flow is counting upon pilfering users from enormous companies like ProSEGUR, Huobi and Dsdaq. 

They need bank licensing for their users but can‚Äôt get a license of their own. Genius?

&amp;#x200B;

Safe to say that RevoluGROUP is a system to facilitate Global financial transactions, from anywhere, to anywhere from anyone to anyone,

* RevoluPAY¬Æ name and design mark registered with Canadian, USA, U.K., European, Chinese and Russian Intellectual Property Offices.
* Corporate focus on Shareholder &amp; Investor exposure to PSD2 open banking and disruptive finance technology backed by Canadian FINTRAC and U.S. FINCEN licenses.

¬∑  ***On May 21, 2020, RevoluGROUP became the first Canadian Company to be granted the prestigious PSD2 banking license*** via the Company's Barcelona-based wholly-owned subsidiary [RevoluPAY S.L.](https://revolugroup.com/subsidiaries/) 

¬∑  A key and significant driver is the Canadian Government's move toward Open Banking.

RevoluPAY is pursuing the rapid penetration of the North and South American Markets, Asia and, subsequently, the rest of the world. The PSD2 directive aims to augment banking competition, engender participation in the payments industry from non-conventional banks, and provide a level playing field by harmonizing consumer protection and rights and obligations for payment providers and users. 

There is great depth and potential to REVO. That potential could be through natural growth and expansion, takeover or merger. Savvy acquisitions and development remittance and FinTech

Banks and firms are investing heavily in technology-based solutions, competing with contemporary fintech companies. As a result, a key growth driver for the global fintech market will pin its worth at approximately USD 305.7 Bn by 2023 and expand at a CAGR of 22.17% during the 2018-2023 period. (Marketwatch: 08/21/2021).

This sector of the market deserves exposure in a growth portfolio. Much like, say, Lithium in the E.V. et al. market, the growth potential is more than a bit compelling.

And REVO management has been growing to this point for more than 25 years. A lot of that tech was well ahead of the need and curve.

And REVO‚Äôs tech development is still ahead of products and needs yet to come in the massive payment and remittance markets.

Besides, there's no denying the established bias of the share price chart."

My Ecosystem Vision,https://www.reddit.com/r/zilliqa/comments/q96fkd/my_ecosystem_vision/,maqstica,1,2021-10-16 14:26:57,0,/r/zilliqa/comments/q96fkd/my_ecosystem_vision/,NaN,"I firmly believe in and envision a world, where:
  
1. **Blockchains will become ubiquitous:** Blockchains will become the backbone of many day-to-day end user applications. These applications will share one common denominator though: **They will enable new incentivised economies for open communities.** The main difference between the various application verticals would be their target communities. For example, a community of money market participants will drive applications around decentralized finance; a community of creators and art consumers will drive a creator economy; and a community of gamers and game developers will drive the adoption of play-to-earn games. Due to the open nature of blockchains and composability of applications, we will also see overlapping communities and applications that will cross over communities. Across all these applications, blockchains as the underlying tech will add value by creating a trustless and censorship-resistant layer for the respective communities.  

2. **DeFi, NFTs (and creator‚Äôs economy), and Social Tokens will be the key drivers:** Over the last couple of years, we have seen noticeable traction and growth in some key verticals namely, decentralized finance, creator economies and social tokens. What we have seen in the Zilliqa ecosystem is representative of that in the broader blockchain space. In the coming years, we will see more developments and funding in the following key application areas:

* **Tokenization:** It has been quite apparent that tokens are undoubtedly a better way to incentivise human activity than shares. They allow more transparent, open, efficient, and fair interactions between market participants, and that too at a low cost. Tokens are constantly transforming the way we imagine money, ownership, utility, incentives, liquidity and much more. We will see more innovative types of tokens getting launched.

* **Democratisation of Finance:** Billions in the world remain unbanked or underbanked. DeFi - built on blockchain‚Äôs permissionless, transparent and censorship resistance architecture has changed this. DeFi welcomes all, regardless of their bank balance, their salary or their credit rating. Autonomous by design, it gives everyone access to financial products and services without needing anything more than a smartphone!
* **Creator‚Äôs economy:** Celebrities and influencers carry as much value as any goods or services. This will give birth to a creator economy which will enable people to monetise themselves - their ‚Äòvirtual‚Äô value becoming tradable on a ‚Äúhumanized stock market‚Äù. Content creators in this economy will get adequately recognised and rewarded for their skills, authenticity and know-how by having direct access to their fans and consumers. 

3. **Divide between DeFi and TradFi will become narrow:** Today, there is a great divide between centralized and decentralized applications. On the one hand, banks are heavily regulated while on the other hand, decentralized finance is hard if not impossible to regulate. We foresee a world where both will adapt. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
For example, many of the traditional institutions are now going digital. Challenger banks today offer retail services to users without needing to set up any physical branches and are offering all of their services via a mobile application. These neo banks also offer crypto-services to their customers presenting themselves as the ideal on and off-ramp providers. 
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, several of the decentralized application builders are now looking to acquire licenses to be able to operate and offer services that require regulatory oversight. We will see applications that will no longer cater only to crypto-native users but also to traditional financial institutions. We will be building products and services that cater to the converging markets.

4. **Blockchains will go to the background:** Many decentralized applications being used today require end users to understand the underlying technology being used, and more often than not have a steep on-boarding/learning curve. We imagine a future, where blockchains will go to the background in the same way the Internet as the enabler for banking and social media applications has. An end-user will not need to know how the underlying tech works before they can start using a decentralized application. **Dapps of the future will not be built for developers but for average users.**

5. **Users will become a first class citizen:** Many of the applications that are being built today are mainly for crypto-native communities. This creates friction points for average end users. There is a lot to learn from traditional centralised applications (from a UX perspective) that we download from an app store. Most of the non-blockchain applications (such as a banking app or a social media app) do not require users to read any tutorial or learn newly invented terms like impermanent loss or collateralized debt positions before they can start using the application. Decentralised applications in the future will take the complexities away and make it as easy as using a non-blockchain application that you would download on your mobile phone.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**The ultimate goal of any token issuer of any dapp or platform should be to convert its token holders into its users.** The more users a platform or a dapp has, the more market share it will attract, thereby creating a sustainable value capture for the underlying token. We will not be able to convert non-crypto users into crypto users, if we are unable to convert our very own token holders (that already have a stake in the system) into actual users of the product that drives that token. Utility tokens will not survive for too long without users extracting utility and governance tokens will not exist in the space for too long if the token holders as stakeholders do not exercise their governance rights. **For most utility tokens, less than 1% of token holders use the tokens for any utility. This has to change!**

6. **Inclusiveness will be a norm and not an exception:** Even though the idea behind blockchains was to provide a platform to bring the unbanked and underbanked, the broader blockchain community has generally failed at that. **Only about 4% of users currently using decentralized applications come from emerging markets. We need to build applications that are more inclusive particularly for those who need them the most.** Blockchains have the potential to change the way a small business owner or a farmer in a remote Indian or Indonesian village gets a micro loan. We envision a world where this should be feasible.

7. **Research-driven development will be the only way:** Blockchain development happens at an extremely fast pace which means that there is a tendency to build fast, break things and introduce fixes along the way. However, given the immutable nature of blockchains, and the fact that these applications run in open and adversarial settings, it is quite apparent that this approach is risky for end users. We have seen financial losses in hundreds of millions of dollars for end users due to this approach. We believe that future projects will require strong academic rigour to guarantee that the protocol remains safe for the applications being built on top.

8. **Formally-verified contracts will outnumber unsafe contracts:** Smart contracts will continue to manage tens of billions of dollars in assets and hence it will become a norm to formally verify contracts. Formally verified contracts will provide mathematical guarantees about the safety and correctness of the business logic. Contracts could carry proofs along with it that any user could verify.

9. **Focus on interoperability:** An average token holder in the crypto-space holds more than a few assets. In many cases, tens of assets if not more. As more blockchain platforms find market fits and establish network effect, a typical user‚Äôs assets will sit on multiple platforms. In that world, platform providers wanting to convert their token holders into users will have a challenging task if the right interoperability tools are not provided to the end user. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A user should not be required to download browser plugins for different chains, select different applications on each chain and then interact with them as if they existed on disconnected islands. Users should be able to use their tokens residing on different chains in a frictionless manner. Interoperability will not only be about moving assets from one chain to another via bridges but also the possibility to have cross-chain wallets, portfolio managers, cross-chain DEXes, cross-chain lending and other dapps and much more.

Onwards and Upwards

Offered an Internship in Construction Project Engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/financestudents/comments/q9hs73/offered_an_internship_in_construction_project/,Mcsmoothie69,1,2021-10-17 02:35:05,0,/r/financestudents/comments/q9hs73/offered_an_internship_in_construction_project/,NaN,"Background Context:

Currently I am a finance major student with an internship in corporate finance. I am enjoying my internship so far, learning a lot of accounting and financial technical skills mainly with Excel and SAP.

However I recently was offered an internship opportunity to be a construction project engineer. I was able find this opportunity speaking to the VP of this construction company. My father is a foreman who sometimes works for their company. I believe this was the driving force to them offering me this opportunity.

Typically construction companies take experienced trades, engineers, or construction management graduates. I am not in that category, I only the basics of construction from listening to my father talk about his career. 

According to the VP, they really liked my personality and they informed me that it would be a learning curve regardless since there isn't necessarily a program that helps you with real world experience.

I'm interested in taking it because this is not a common opportunity for finance majors. I find the job aspects interesting as well. You will be in charge of knowing all aspects of the project from blue prints, contracts, and communicating with all the specific domains on the project.

I think it's a good opportunity to learn management skills and develop more soft skills since most of the job you are the liaison between the owners, contractor, sub-contractors, corporate, and foreman. 

I considering doing for the experience and if I don't like I can try to pivot the experience using the skills mentioned above. I believe this an important quality employers are seeking. Another reason is because who knows I might enjoy it more than corporate finance.

Do you think this will affect my potential career in corporate finance?

Should I wait for the upcoming finance summer internships this summer.


*My current internship ends in April 2022 and is my only finance related internship (6 month internship) 

The construction is willing to start me right after I finish my current one. Based off performance they typically hire their interns after they graduate.

I graduate fall 2022"

Comparable transaction price to Polygon network (thanks to Polygon's 30x increase);

Has its own coin to pay gas fee which is FTM, transaction cost is around same or double the fee on Polygon network. Can go to 10x the fee on Polygon when the network is really busy. 

Has Curve.

Has Yearn finance.

Has Beefy and Autofarm.

FTM total market cap is around half of MATIC market cap.

TLV was huge thanks to shit coin farming Geist finance

And TLV is still a bit more than Polygon network

A lot more projects than AVAX, HECO, ARB, Harmony, though less than Polygon. Polygon is still the king in terms of maturity useability, adoption.

Arbitrum and Optimism does not have their own coin, you still pay gas fee in ETH, so no thanks.

Binance chian is ok but transaction fee is like 70x more than Polygon/FTM. And Binance is evil. Stay away from Binance / BSC / Trust wallet.

**TLDR**:

Recently, the cryptocurrency market has become more and more exciting because of the rapid increase in the number of new participants. In the current situation of extremely low bank interest rates, more and more people with a demand for ""fixed interest rate loans of 10% a year"" will step into this market.

Applications like Outlet, Linus, Dharma, BlockFi, Celsius have developed user interfaces to meet this need, with liquidity coming from centralised liquidity pools or from Compound and Aave. Therefore, users' attention to decentralised fixed-rate products will be even greater.

# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to [Icmagroup](https://www.icmagroup.org/Regulatory-Policy-and-Market-Practice/Secondary-Markets/bond-market-size/), the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.

Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.

These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.

When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds  
This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds  
These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds  
This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds.  
Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

According to [Icmagroup](https://www.icmagroup.org/Regulatory-Policy-and-Market-Practice/Secondary-Markets/bond-market-size/), the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.

Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.

These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.

When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds  
This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds  
These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds  
This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds.  
Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

Recently, the cryptocurrency market has become more and more exciting because of the rapid increase in the number of new participants. In the current situation of extremely low bank interest rates, more and more people with a demand for ""fixed interest rate loans of 10% a year"" will step into this market.

Applications like Outlet, Linus, Dharma, BlockFi, Celsius have developed user interfaces to meet this need, with liquidity coming from centralised liquidity pools or from Compound and Aave. Therefore, users' attention to decentralised fixed-rate products will be even greater.

1. Questions about **inSPIRIT**? See below!
2. Is there an **audit**?  
Yes, we were **audited by MixBytes**, the same firm that audited projects like Aave, Yearn Finance, Curve, 1inch, CREAM, Sushi. Check out the [full audit here](https://github.com/Layer3Org/spiritswap-core/blob/main/SpiritSwap-Core%20Security%20Audit%20Report.pdf).
3. When was SpiritSwap launched?  
Farming on SpiritSwap started on the **26th of April 2021**.
4. What was the **starting price**?  
**$0.001** (yep)
5. Is there a **roadmap**?  
Yes, [here](https://layer3.gitbook.io/spirit-swap/roadmap).
6. Will people providing LP via an auto-compounding vault be eligible for **Spirit of the Month**?  
No.
7. How can I **transfer funds** from BSC or other chains?  
Have a look at [this article](https://spiritswap.medium.com/fantom-opera-an-easy-transition-from-binance-smart-chain-2576d5d50bce).
8. When is the **airdrop**?  
SPIRIT airdrops have already taken place, no new SPIRIT airdrops are currently planned. Have a chat with **Charon** on **üõ∂-river-styx** to be eligible for new airdrops from our partners and for other rewards!
9. Does anybody know a good **LP value tracker** for?  
Check out [vfat.tools](https://vfat.tools/fantom/spirit/)
10. Where can I **buy SPIRIT tokens**?  
[Here](https://swap.spiritswap.finance/#/swap).
11. What is **impermanent loss** (IL)?  
Imagine two teams play tug of war. The goal isn't to win. It's to maintain a balance. If team A overpowers B (the price of token A increases &amp; B decreases), some people from team A move to team B to maintain this balance (the quantity of token A decreases &amp; B increases). Basically, token quantities adjust as token power changes.  
This means that the trader now loses some of token A and has more of token B. When token A's price continues to rise, and token B's price remains the same, token A's quantity decreases, and thus, the trader loses money compared to when they just hold 50% of their money in token A and 50% in token B.  
This is called ""impermanent loss"" because the ratio of the prices of the two tokens A and B constantly changes. If this ratio were to return to the same as when the trader deposited these two tokens into the liquidity pool, they'd have no loss. It's only a permanent loss once the tokens are removed from their LP pair.

**inSPIRIT FAQs**

1. **When will I receive the swap fees** for the first time if I lock now?  
Short answer: the payout is always 2 Thursdays away and happens at 00:00 GMT+0.  
Long answer: the locking mechanism is related to the distribution epoch. You will *start earning fees* when the timer restarts, and will be able to *claim the fees* only a week later.  
Note: you won‚Äôt receive rewards the first time the timer restarts, that‚Äôs when you will start to earn rewards. You‚Äôll receive these rewards the next time the timer restarts.
2. Does the amount of inSPIRIT increase if you **increase the lock period**?  
Yes, you can check this on the inSPIRIT page itself: when you select a longer lock period, you‚Äôll see the amount of inSPIRIT you‚Äôll receive increase.
3. Can I **vote** multiple times?  
Yes, you can vote multiple times and reallocate your votes as you please.
4. If you want to calculate how many inSPIRIT you need for the maximum boost, you can refer to the following equation:  
*inSPIRIT needed = (your liquidity in the farm ($)/total liquidity in the farm ($)) \* inSPIRIT total supply*  
As you can see, the inSPIRIT needed are calculated from the ratio between what you deposited and the total balance of the farm (that is to say, what percentage of the farm you ‚Äúown‚Äù), all multiplied by the total supply of inSPIRIT.  
Example: if there are $5,000,000 in the farm and you have $1,000 deposited there, if the total supply of inSPIRIT is 15,000,000 you‚Äôll need (1,000/5,000,000)\*15,000,000 = 3,000 inSPIRIT.  
Please keep in mind that inSPIRIT is designed to decrease with time, so you‚Äôll have to take this into consideration in order to keep enjoying maximum APR."
[L] Panicking every day about my lack of a career or direction.,https://www.reddit.com/r/KindVoice/comments/q9xk9k/l_panicking_every_day_about_my_lack_of_a_career/,crashboxer1678,1,2021-10-17 20:15:39,5,/r/KindVoice/comments/q9xk9k/l_panicking_every_day_about_my_lack_of_a_career/,Looking,"I did horribly in undergrad as an engineering major, but got into a grad school for a different engineering major anyway. Went from undergrad to grad school directly, after getting 150 rejections for jobs due to my terrible undergrad grades. The grad school didn't have enough teachers to teach certain courses, so I didn't feel like I learned much once I left. I'm in a state of limbo where I feel like the last 6 years of my life were a waste, I'll never find a proper career, I won't be able to support my family (my mom's been out of work on disability for 8 years now) and I'm not sure what to do next. So scared, feeling so useless.

Undergrad was in mechanical engineering. I didn't understand the material in vibrations or material mechanics or electronics or even kinematics. I had to retake a lot of courses in winter and summer. Didn't have any friends, suffered in silence for a lot of semesters, but eventually went to campus counseling. It helped me with my emotional issues but I didn't become a better student. Autodesk/Solidworks/Creo/ANSYS and other AutoCAD programs were really difficult for me. I had a B-C average, was seriously depressed, occasionally skipped classes or outright failed with F's, and graduated with a 2.7. 

Got to grad school for industrial engineering but I wanted to study under the ergonomics track in IE. There weren't enough faculty so a lot of my ergo courses were unavailable and I had to take manufacturing, statistics and finance courses. I was alright in them but my grades were curved to an A all the time, and I haven't retained much - other than shop floor resource flow when simulated (and I'm not an expert at the simulation by any means - my professor had to come help me out during the exam), ANOVA that I've always known, resource leveling calculations between workstations and spine biomechanics. That's a small percentage of the top-down topics I was introduced to, but not in-depth. Left grad school with a 3.8 (due to the curve) and my thesis project was cancelled by the pandemic before I could even really define it. I'm not sure what to label myself as when job searching.

I feel like I don't really know much. Every time I'm asked about my suitability on interviews I break into a cold sweat. An interviewer was so impressed by my ""master's in industrial engineering"" that he simply assumed I know everything about Lean Six Sigma and that I'm ahead of his current workers. I'm only White trained, basic, and that was on my own, not with the help of grad school. This is a position that would have me move states, and I don't want to get there and not have any idea what I'm doing. 

Panicking every day. I'm not sure if I'm even going to be a subject matter expert in anything, or even how to start my career. I don't even know what that career would look like. I'm interested in ergonomics and occupational safety and health. I never got to explore that. Was my entire collegiate career a waste? It feels really bad.

TL,DR: Struggled in undergrad and barely scraped by with a sub-3.0, feel like I didn't learn enough in grad school and got away with ignorance due to a grading curve. Panicking that I have no discernable skills to be hired by anyone, and this will be consistent through the rest of my life."

 WHAT IS [SIL](https://sil.finance)

DeFi projects are taking a huge turn. With the cryptocurrency industry adopting DeFi projects, many of them are becoming extra popular. SIL Finance is indeed one of the most popular DeFi projects in today's time.

This project was established around a year ago, SIL Finance is really taking over the market. However, many people involved in the cryptocurrency industry are still unaware of this trend.

Sil_Finance which is also know as ""Sister In law Finance"" is a single sided yield aggregator (1 click hedging) with adventurous functional #NFT farming card add-ons. Or in formal form it‚Äôs a decentralized automatic investment platform based on smart contracts, focusing on providing users with DeFi Financial Management services. SIL provides dual-token liquidity for variable swaps, automatic LP matching, and automatic compound interests.¬†

According to factors such as annualized rate of return, safety factor, financial management cycle, etc., it automatically selects and configures products that best suit the interests of users, making complex liquidity mining to become simple. | The SIL‚Äôs model is unique on the DeFi market, it‚Äôs single-sided functionality is solely contributed by users, the product gives all the possible choices back to the community and is way more open than yield products.

THE FEATURES OF SIL_FINANCE

The exclusive features of SIL is what has made it so popular among everyone. The total circulation value of SIL is 30,000. As a result, it needs to be regulated within similar manners.

HEDGING

One of the core features of SIL is to bet on long or/and short, which essentially utilize the AMM protocol and SIL‚Äôs LP composition at the same time. It requires users to have some pre-judgements of the market, the best practice is to stake long-term bullish, short-term bearish assets.

At the time being, SIL‚Äôs HEDGING mode has been launched on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. Each chain supports different trading pairs on different swaps, but the mechanism is the same.

The benefit of using SIL‚Äôs hedge instead of controlling positions manually or using contract, is that:

SIL‚Äôs hedging can‚Äôt get you liquidated, it‚Äôs has a mild curve as the UNI v2 curve

Relative price(A/B assets) impact (raterate) will be reduced to¬†\sqrt{rate}rate‚Äã

YIELD

In SIL yield mood, users rangeed from entry-level to advanced all can easily participate. This mode is based on AMM protocol(UNIv2) and SIL‚Äôs LP composition and SIL's auto-compound and and SIL's IL Mitigation all at the same time. It doesn't require users to have pre-judgements of the market or sort, just deposit and earn.

Sil_finance¬†is the world's first decentralized LP composer that purely built on smart contracts technologies, to user's concept, it's a single sided yield aggregator (1 click hedging) with adventurous functional #NFT farming card add-ons. SIL focuses on providing users with unique DeFi Financial Management experiences with creative recreations.

According to factors such as ARR (Annualized Rate of Return), coefficient, financial management cycle, etc., it automatically selects and configures products that are most in line with the interests of users, allowing complex liquidity mining become a joint construction of currency participants, and the management of the platform is entrusted to all SIL holders.

**THE PRODUCT FEATURES OF SIL**

**Dual currency SIL Vault**

Each user only needs to stake currency to join LP pool. Currently dual currency APY is generally higher than single currency mining.

SIL will bring real liquidity to partnered Swaps. Not a simple matryoshka doll mechanism.

There is no need to exchange for another coin for mining, each party of the paired LP bears one coin‚Äôs impermanent loss for free, but obtains high annualized earnings.

**Compound interest model**

Deposit token into SIL and it will be paired into LP, stake LP to mining contract CLAIM earnings

CLAIM earnings are exchanged for 2 coins to form a new LP and re-stake. And the newly added LP will be distributed to the current LP pool users according to the share.

**Token automatic matching LP**

When the user adds the token to SIL, it will be automatically paired to LP for mining. At the same time, the user holds half of the LP‚Äôs equity (that is, the LP gains after the burn, the corresponding token gains), and can choose to withdraw the token from the LP at any time.

The matching mechanism is a three-tier model to ensure that the first entrant has a superior queue position.

**Token pairing earnings: Token paired as LP, there will be two levels of earnings.**

As an LP liquidity provider, receive transaction fee earnings of automatic market making (for example, Uniswap provides 0.03% transaction fee)

LP stakes for mining, swap the mined token (UNI, SUSHI, etc.), re-form LP and distribute to users, enjoying passive compound interest growth

For example: Adding USDT and paired with ETH in the pool as LP, and the user has the ownership of this LP (USDT part), and at the same time has the earnings of LP transaction fees, as well as the compound interest earnings of LP. When the user chooses to exit, the LP releases more USDT depending on the compounded interest and returns it to the user. The corresponding ETH will re-enter the pairing queue to prepare for the next pairing.

[Psychedelica.One Tiles](https://i.redd.it/d3ndl1uy54u71.gif)

&amp;#x200B;

Hello fellow crypto enthusiast - Thank you for stopping by and checking us out. Ive had my entirety consumed by NFTs, and my team has finally launched the Genesis Token at [**Psychedelica.one**](https://Psychedelica.one) on the Harmony One Protocol.

I think what really sets us apart from other projects, is that *nothing is pre-decided or pre uploaded.* The images are created when you press the button, and once you discard it, it will never come back. 

The tokens are priced on a bonding curve, and will able to be resold on our marketplace when it is live in a couple of weeks. I have airdrops planned for all future public projects that we create for Genesis token holders, as well as access to exclusive mints that we are currently designing, the first of both may or may not be launching next week.

We are doing something different. You are able to press the generate button as many times as you‚Äôd like (for free) and choose the NFT you would want to buy. The NFT will serve as your ‚Äúlogin‚Äù token to our exclusive mint page, where we will have limited mints for members only. It will also be your ticket to free NFTs airdropped to your wallet for supporting us. The art in this project is created with math - there are no layers or pre created images involved - strictly code to canvas.

Our core team is two crypto native dads from California, who have managed to find a way out of the rat race and create something immutable. Many sleepless nights and thousands of hours of research and work went into this project. Finally last week - we successfully deployed our token, and got the site functioning. Below is the excerpt from the website:

&gt;The Genesis project is 10000 mathematically generated canvasses with a near infinite amount of possible permutations. This collection is just the beginning and is displayed on 333x333 pixel tiles. It initiates the genesis of our body of work. Each image generated is unique. Once a new images is created, the previous one is gone forever. The collection is not pre-determined in any way. With this model, we refute the idea of rarity for the sake of rarity, and leave beauty to the eye of the beholder. We hope you like what you see.

Future plans include collaborations with other artists, as well as several nationally touring musicians and bands (TBA). If you‚Äôd like to keep up to date with all the stuff we are working on or have any questions, stop by [Stepdad.finance](https://stepdad.finance) \- or give us a shout on twitter @ financestepdad. We‚Äôre just starting to roll things out - but we have some really cool stuff in the works: a couple of arcade style blockchain games, some PFP projects, and some super rad experimental stuff that I won‚Äôt even mention yet.

Currently I am a finance major student with an internship in corporate finance. I am enjoying my internship so far, learning a lot of accounting and financial technical skills mainly with Excel and SAP.

However I recently was offered an internship opportunity to be a construction project engineer. I was able find this opportunity speaking to the VP of this construction company. My father is a foreman who sometimes works for their company. I believe this was the driving force to them offering me this opportunity.

Typically construction companies take experienced trades, engineers, or construction management graduates. I am not in that category, I only the basics of construction from listening to my father talk about his career. 

According to the VP, they really liked my personality and they informed me that it would be a learning curve regardless since there isn't necessarily a program that helps you with real world experience.

I'm interested in taking it because this is not a common opportunity for finance majors. I find the job aspects interesting as well. You will be in charge of knowing all aspects of the project from blue prints, contracts, and communicating with all the specific domains on the project.

I think it's a good opportunity to learn management skills and develop more soft skills since most of the job you are the liaison between the owners, contractor, sub-contractors, corporate, and foreman. 

I considering doing for the experience and if I don't like I can try to pivot the experience using the skills mentioned above. I believe this an important quality employers are seeking. Another reason is because who knows I might enjoy it more than corporate finance.

Do you think this will affect my potential career in corporate finance?

Should I wait for the upcoming finance summer internships this summer?


*My current internship ends in April 2022 and is my only finance related internship (6 month internship) 

The construction is willing to start me right after I finish my current one. Based off performance they typically hire their interns after they graduate.

Before I get into it, Just a quick recap of what SIL finance is all about: 
SIL (Sister In-law) Finance is a decentralized LP composer that is purely built on smart contracts technologies. SIL focuses on providing users with unique DeFi Financial Management experiences.

Why was SIL Finance launched?
It's no longer news the Defi Community is evolving rapidly, and one of the biggest challenges introduced by AMM swapping is the unstable Loss/Gain, an unavoidable
learning curve that most users will face while providing liquidity to any automated market maker (AMM) swaps.

In addition, looking at the situation from the client‚Äôs viewpoint, in most cases, single token yielding profit is quite low, the LP mining‚Äôs profit is relatively higher since trading liquidity is enhanced. Sometimes users only hold one type of token, and those users usually go to lending protocols to borrow the counterparty token, which will increase the risk of liquidation, lower capital utilization (the lending rate commonly marked to 70% or lower).

SIL tries to resolve these issues of Loss and Capital Utilization by Sharing the Volatility(Yield) or Individual Volatility (Hedging). SIL is equivalent to skipping the lending at the same time avoiding the two problems mentioned above. To minimize the volatility bias, SIL introduced a smart contract-based matching engine that provides an additional solution for current LP miners, only a single-side token is required.

SIL Finance Tokenomics
The native governance token of SIL finance is the $SIL token.
The total of $SIL tokens in circulation is 30,000.
Minted in a near-linear fashion, All tokens are minted, no pre-allocation

The Community will share 68% of the total minted tokens from liquidity mining.
The Governance Treasury will share 15% of the total minted tokens from liquidity. Governance Treasury will be protected by Voting Contract, Multi- Sign Contract and TimeLock Contract.
The developing team will share 17% of SIL from liquidity mining when user withdraw funds, and the developing team will share no other profits 
The developing team will use the token to cover:
Payroll
Regular on-chain operations (price feed, SIL repurchase and return to the mining pool)
Future product development and operating expenses."

Yield Farming Aggregator,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ZunamiProtocol/comments/qaqe4g/yield_farming_aggregator/,ZunamiProtocol,1,2021-10-19 00:36:58,0,/r/u_ZunamiProtocol/comments/qaqe4g/yield_farming_aggregator/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r0asmwyzk8u71.jpg?width=1240&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40d0ac95edf625dd50a128adfba800b23af78722

In our [previous article](https://zunamiprotocol.medium.com/the-safest-stablecoin-manager-a19ef90775b1) we have covered why Zunami Protocol works only with stablecoins and what promising future we see for it. As of now, there are several similar yield farming aggregators, but not all of them are reliable. Zunami‚Äôs smart contract automatically checks insurance availability, so we could send funds only to those dApps, which have enough insurance coverage in secure and safe insurance companies (like [armor.fi](https://armor.fi/)).

&gt;*The way how the users‚Äô funds will be invested and balanced is going to be controlled by DAO through the voting of ZUN token holders. The choice of dApp to invest in is based on two criterias ‚Äî maximum profit and insurance coverage.*

Also we‚Äôre developing a sophisticated allocation mechanism, which allows us to allocate the funds to dApps working on different blockchains or layers. But only if they provide enough yield and allocated funds can be 100% insured.

&amp;#x200B;

[How does Zunami Protocol work](https://preview.redd.it/fxzm7324l8u71.jpg?width=1240&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cdf57c31df07078f63d08cc503e9195ef6d332f)

At this time we think the most interesting dApps related to yield farming are these:

**Curve finance** ‚Äî one of the biggest stablecoin exchange platforms was founded in 2020 by a group of blockchain enthusiasts. We‚Äôre connected to Curve as a liquidity provider, including Polygon and Fantom versions.

**Yearn finance** ‚Äî the creation of DeFi guru Andre Cronje. The biggest assets manager. Zunami allocates users‚Äô funds to the most suitable pools at Yearn.

**KeeperDAO** ‚Äî a project which manages liquidations, rebalances and arbitrage on dApps. With Zunami as a user you can easily interact with KeeperDAO, as we automatically sell rewards and reinvest the profit.

**mStable** is a protocol that unites stablecoins, lending and swapping into one robust and easy to use standard. This project created it‚Äôs own stablecoin mUSD, which gives extra yield by staking it. mStable has passed many security audits and has become one of the most reliable platforms in the crypto world.

SIL provides dual-token liquidity for variable swaps, automatic LP matching &amp; compound interests. Based on factors like annual return rate, safety factor, financial management cycle, etc, it automatically selects and configures products that best suit the interests of users, making complex liquidity mining to become less complicated.
Sil finance is the world's first decentralized LP composer that is purely built on smart contracts technologies. To the user's concept, it is a single sided yield aggregator (1 click hedging) with adventurous functional #NFT farming card add-ons. SIL focuses on providing users with unique DeFi Financial Management experiences with creative recreations. Find out more here https://sil.finance/.

The native governance token of SIL Finance is the $SIL Token.

Some of SIL's products include;
- YIELD
One of the core features of SIL is the Yield Mode, where users ranging from entry level to advanced level can all participate easily. This mode is based on AMM protocol(UNIv2), SIL‚Äôs LP composition, SIL's auto-compound and SIL's IL Mitigation all at the same time. It doesn't require users to have pre-judgements of the market or anything of the sort, just deposit and start earning.
The benefit of using SIL‚Äôs Yield Mode instead of controlling positions manually, is that SIL‚Äôs Yield Mode is quite stable, and mitigating IL at the same time.
You only need to deposit single-sided tokens without worrying about counter-party assets.
Presently, SIL‚Äôs Yield Mode has been launched on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and OkexChain. Each chain supports different trading pairs on different swaps.
- HEDGE
Another core feature of SIL is the Hedge mode which allows users to bet on long or/and short. This mode essentially utilizes the AMM protocol and SIL‚Äôs LP composition at the same time. It requires users to have some pre-judgements of the market, the best practice is to stake long-term bullish, short-term bearish assets.
The benefit of using SIL‚Äôs hedge instead of controlling positions manually or using contract, is that SIL‚Äôs hedging can‚Äôt get you liquidated. It has a mild curve as the UNI v2 curve.
Relative price(A/B assets) impact (raterate) will be reduced to \sqrt{rate} rate
‚Äã	
Presently, SIL‚Äôs HEDGING mode has been launched on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. Each chain supports different trading pairs on different swaps, but the mechanism is the same.

- SIL NFT
SIL's NFT is Augmented Functional NFT (SAFN), which will enhance the user's mining experience in many different ways.
Each SAFN has an attribute that contains the effect of acceleration or deceleration. The acceleration card enhances the mining speed of matching LP assets, and each SAFN has a corresponding coin that is in effect (e.g., it is in effect for ETH coins), and its effective length of use varies. Each card has a unique number, which can also be read by the digital wallet that stores the card.

Another core feature of SIL is the Hedge mode which allows users to bet on long or/and short. This mode essentially utilizes the AMM protocol and SIL‚Äôs LP composition at the same time. It requires users to have some pre-judgements of the market, the best practice is to stake long-term bullish, short-term bearish assets.
The benefit of using SIL‚Äôs hedge instead of controlling positions manually or using contract, is that SIL‚Äôs hedging can‚Äôt get you liquidated. It has a mild curve as the UNI v2 curve.
Relative price(A/B assets) impact (raterate) will be reduced to \sqrt{rate} rate
‚Äã	
Presently, SIL‚Äôs HEDGING mode has been launched on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. Each chain supports different trading pairs on different swaps, but the mechanism is the same.

- SIL NFT
SIL's NFT is Augmented Functional NFT (SAFN), which will enhance the user's mining experience in many different ways.
Each SAFN has an attribute that contains the effect of acceleration or deceleration. The acceleration card enhances the mining speed of matching LP assets, and each SAFN has a corresponding coin that is in effect (e.g., it is in effect for ETH coins), and its effective length of use varies. Each card has a unique number, which can also be read by the digital wallet that stores the card.

MORE ABOUT SIL FINANCE AND IT'S TOKENOMICS,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptomoongroup/comments/qar1nk/more_about_sil_finance_and_its_tokenomics/,Chalinerados,1,2021-10-19 01:07:42,1,/r/cryptomoongroup/comments/qar1nk/more_about_sil_finance_and_its_tokenomics/,NaN,"So we've been introduced to SIL finance and now it's time to answer some of the questions you might have(if you missed it you could catch up from the posts on my profile). Before I get into it, Just a quick recap of what SIL finance is all about: 
SIL (Sister In-law) Finance is a decentralized LP composer that is purely built on smart contracts technologies. SIL focuses on providing users with unique DeFi Financial Management experiences.

Why was SIL Finance launched?
It's no longer news the Defi Community is evolving rapidly, and one of the biggest challenges introduced by AMM swapping is the unstable Loss/Gain, an unavoidable
learning curve that most users will face while providing liquidity to any automated market maker (AMM) swaps.

In addition, looking at the situation from the client‚Äôs viewpoint, in most cases, single token yielding profit is quite low, the LP mining‚Äôs profit is relatively higher since trading liquidity is enhanced. Sometimes users only hold one type of token, and those users usually go to lending protocols to borrow the counterparty token, which will increase the risk of liquidation, lower capital utilization (the lending rate commonly marked to 70% or lower).

SIL tries to resolve these issues of Loss and Capital Utilization by Sharing the Volatility(Yield) or Individual Volatility (Hedging). SIL is equivalent to skipping the lending at the same time avoiding the two problems mentioned above. To minimize the volatility bias, SIL introduced a smart contract-based matching engine that provides an additional solution for current LP miners, only a single-side token is required.

SIL Finance Tokenomics
The native governance token of SIL finance is the $SIL token.
The total of $SIL tokens in circulation is 30,000.
Minted in a near-linear fashion, All tokens are minted, no pre-allocation

The Community will share 68% of the total minted tokens from liquidity mining.
The Governance Treasury will share 15% of the total minted tokens from liquidity. Governance Treasury will be protected by Voting Contract, Multi- Sign Contract and TimeLock Contract.
The developing team will share 17% of SIL from liquidity mining when user withdraw funds, and the developing team will share no other profits 
The developing team will use the token to cover:
Payroll
Regular on-chain operations (price feed, SIL repurchase and return to the mining pool)
Future product development and operating expenses."

Sil Finance is an open sourced, single sided yield aggregator (1 click hedging) with fully functional #NFT farming card add-ons, or more explicitly, it's a smart contract-based decentralized automatic investment platform that focuses on providing consumers with DeFi Financial Management services.

Tradeable currently on PancakeSwap. As a result, the SIL Token is our native governance token; all tokens are minted, with no pre-allocation or anything of the sort, and a total supply of 30000 $SIL across all networks. ERC-20 / BEP-20 smart contracts are supported.

Why SIL(or better yet, what does is bring to the DeFi space)? 

The Impermanent Loss/Gain, an inherent learning curve that most users will suffer while supplying liquidity to any automated market maker (AMM) swaps, is one of the most significant risks presented by AMM swapping in recent years.

By Sharing the Volatility(Yield) or Individual Volatility (Hedging) To reduce volatility bias, SIL launched a smart contract-based matching engine, which gives an additional solution for current LP miners, using only a single-side token. That's amazing, because with SIL, you don't have to worry about impermanent losses or capital utilization.

Some services provided by SIL,  
1.Dual-token liquidity for variable swaps, 
2.Automatic LP matching, and
3.Automatic compound interests.

Factors SIL considers to serve the interest of the user
 1. Annualized rate of return, 
2. Safety factor, 
3. Financial management cycle

The criteria listed above are taken into account by SIL to automatically choose and configure solutions that best meet the needs of users, making sophisticated liquidity mining simple.

The SIL's model is unusual in the DeFi industry; its single-sided functionality is entirely given by users, and the product gives the community all of the conceivable options, making it far more open than comparable solutions. SIL also allows mining, and mining earnings are distributed proportionally to all users; there will be no intermediary and no principal commission costs. It‚Äôs fair and just.

2. MatchPair and
3. StakeGatling.

A little dive into each feature
1. SIL Master is the entry management contract, processing transactions and the distribution of SIL Token.

2.  MatchPair is responsible for matching. This also ensures that users with priority recharge are in a relatively safe queue position.
3. StakeGatling is responsible for collateralizing the matched LP to the mining contract, but then, according to the configuration strategy, it will automatically roll out the profit, CLAIM income, and convert CLAIM income into LP through Swap/Mint, as well as re-mortgage to obtain income to ensure the maximum benefit.

By Sharing the Volatility(Yield) or Individual Volatility (Hedging) To reduce volatility bias, SIL launched a smart contract-based matching engine, which gives an additional solution for current LP miners, using only a single-side token. That's amazing, because with SIL, you don't have to worry about impermanent losses or capital utilization.

Some services provided by SIL,  
1.Dual-token liquidity for variable swaps, 
2.Automatic LP matching, and
3.Automatic compound interests.

Factors SIL considers to serve the interest of the user
 1. Annualized rate of return, 
2. Safety factor, 
3. Financial management cycle

The criteria listed above are taken into account by SIL to automatically choose and configure solutions that best meet the needs of users, making sophisticated liquidity mining simple.

The SIL's model is unusual in the DeFi industry; its single-sided functionality is entirely given by users, and the product gives the community all of the conceivable options, making it far more open than comparable solutions. SIL also allows mining, and mining earnings are distributed proportionally to all users; there will be no intermediary and no principal commission costs. It‚Äôs fair and just. A cutting-edge platform constructed by crypto enthusiasts from all around the world, with all SIL holders sharing in the network's management (community)

SIL architecture
1. SIL Master, 
2. MatchPair and
3. StakeGatling.

A little dive into each feature
1. SIL Master is the entry management contract, processing transactions and the distribution of SIL Token.

2.  MatchPair is responsible for matching. This also ensures that users with priority recharge are in a relatively safe queue position.
3. StakeGatling is responsible for collateralizing the matched LP to the mining contract, but then, according to the configuration strategy, it will automatically roll out the profit, CLAIM income, and convert CLAIM income into LP through Swap/Mint, as well as re-mortgage to obtain income to ensure the maximum benefit.

3 Minutes to Understand the Next Generation of Defi ‚Äî the Tokenomics of BEST,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto_newstoday/comments/qbkjeb/3_minutes_to_understand_the_next_generation_of/,Shiba__lnu,1,2021-10-20 04:45:44,0,/r/crypto_newstoday/comments/qbkjeb/3_minutes_to_understand_the_next_generation_of/,defi,"&amp;#x200B;

  
Since Nakamoto pegged PoW to mining, hashrate has become the hard currency in the blockchain world. Users with hashrate have a say and the right to enjoy PoW income, which is the reason why many people flock to it. Bitcoin‚Äôs hashrate exceeded 1T for the first time in May 2011 and reached 197 EH/S by May 2021. Ethereum‚Äôs hashrate also increased from 150T in early 2020 to 595 TH/S in May 2021.

  
The substantial growth of hashrate confirms the progress made by cryptocurrency which once was favored by a small number of people and now is embraced by the majority. This is also a process in which the mining becomes less popualr. With the continuous expansion of hashrate total volume, the income per unit of hashrate is declining. Miners must form a mining pool to make the income curve smooth. With the continuous increase of mining threshold, it is becoming more difficult for ordinary people to enjoy stable mining income.

  
Behind the expansion of bitcoin‚Äôs hashrate is the relentless encirclement and suppression of individual miners.

  


  
One of the important characteristics of cryptocurrency is decentralization. Is there a way to decentralize, so that ordinary users can enjoy the mining income during both the bull and bear market in a simple and stable way?

  
The answer is yes. Even new miners no longer need to choose and purchase mining machines by themselves, neither do they need to bear the high-risk for low-income of cloud hashrate. Through the hashrate token, individual users can avoid all kinds of pitfalls in the participation of mining. Bitcoin and Ethereum Standard Token (‚ÄúBEST‚Äù) is a new generation of hashrate token. It adds Defi to the traditional hashrate token, so that more users can participate in the mining industry.

  
BEST is issued by BESToken Mining. It anchors real Bitcoin mining hashrate and Ethereum mining hashrate. Holding and staking BEST can continuously obtain BTC mining income and ETH mining income. Users can provide liquidity to the market and obtain governance token MUSK through staking BEST. Everyone can easily enjoy the income generated by hashrate + DeFi mining. BEST has not only successfully obtained investments from AU21, Infinity Labs, Hotbit Labs, Oasis Capital, 7 O‚ÄôClock Foundation, Crypto Venture Capital, PolkaFund, 4SV, Bondly Finance, KickPad, Red Block Chain and other investors, but also won the favor of the community. For example, the IDO on DuckDAO was snapped up in 30 seconds. The reason that BEST can attract such heated attention and won the favor of capital and the community lies in its unique tokenomics.

  
Economic Efficiency + Governance Strengthening, BEST‚Äôs ‚ÄúDual-Core‚Äù Tokenomics.

  
BEST adopts the mode ‚ÄúDual-Coin‚Äù, ‚ÄúDual-Core‚Äù and ‚ÄúDual-Thread‚Äùas its underlying tokenomics, to ensure that the overall operation of the BEST system can achieve both high efficiency and stability, and is more user-friendly. The key to the ‚ÄúDual-Core‚Äùmodel is the BEST hashrate token and the MUSK governance token. By holding and staking BEST, users can not only obtain BTC and ETH as mining awards, but also obtain the governance token MUSK. It means users can obtain three different tokens through BEST, which is equivalent to three times the return rate of the same asset.

  
BEST integrates the mining right of high-quality cryptocurrency assets and mining capacity into its token ‚ÄúBEST‚Äù. Holding BEST is equivalent to holding mining capacity. Users don‚Äôt need to consider complex factors such as mine field, platform, cost, operation and maintenance. They only need to stake BEST on the official website DAPP or increase the liquidity of the corresponding trading pairs in the DEXs, then they can continuously obtain the mining incomes.

  
It is the trend of the crypto mining industry to transform hashrate into a more secure and liquid decentralized token through Defi. The mining industry is more technology-intensive and capital-intensive today, therefore the trend mentioned above is more suitable for user participation, because it solved the shortcomings of the traditional cloud hashrate. With the development of BEST ecosystem, holding BEST will get more mining rights of high-quality encrypted assets.

  
Users can obtain multiple benefits through the ‚ÄúBEST +MUSK Dual-Coin‚Äù mechanism

  
The total amount of BEST is 5 million, and the initial circulation is 180,000, accounting for only 3.6% of the total amount. The total amount will rise with the increase of the mining machines managed by the team. Each BEST is equal to 0.01t/s hashrate BTC and 0.03m/s hashrate ETH. BEST‚Äôs mining hashrate is provided by BESToken Mining. BESToken Mining has mine fields in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Sichuan, and has signed cooperation contracts with local power plants. Users do not need to worry about power sources and compliance issues. BEST also cooperates with F2pool. Its machine has entered F2pool for mining. At present, F2pool is a world-famous bitcoin and Ethereum mining pool with huge hashrate, which can provide users with stable and computable expected revenue curve.

  
BEST will deduct 2.5% BTC and 2% ETH as transaction fee according to F2pool‚Äôs standard, and then distribute the remaining income according to the ratio of 7:2:1 at 0:00 (SGT) every day. 70% will be distributed as mining reward to BEST stakers and LP, 20% to repurchase MUSK and burn them, and the remaining 10% as depreciation rate for mining machinery maintenance or renewal.

  
The number of BEST circulating in the market will be counted by day, and the BTC and ETH will be dropped into the mining pool according to hashrate. After deducting the electricity charges and some operation and maintenance costs, the remaining income will be dropped and the smart contract will distribute the income to the beneficiaries, that is, the users who stake BEST on the official website. The whole process is completely open and transparent, and users do not need to conduct cumbersome operation. Staking is mining. Note: users need to bind their own wallet address (BSC) before staking BEST.

  
The total number of MUSK is fixed at 10 million. Its releasing model adopts the deflation tokenomics. The initial output is 30000 / day, which will be reduced by 13% every 30 days until all 10 million MUSKs are produced. The only way to generate MUSK is to continuously provide liquidity for trading pairs as a liquidity provider LP. In the current tokenomics, 75% of the daily output will be allocated to the LP of BEST-BUSD trading pair, and 25% to the LP of MUSK-BUSD trading pair.

  
Users with MUSK have the right to participate in the governance of BEST ecosystem. Besides, the team will also buy back MUSK to support its strong price. 20% of the mining income of BEST will be used to repurchase and burn MUSK. With the continuous growth of the ecosystem, part of the ecosystem income will also be used to repurchase MUSK, to achieve the linear increase of MUSK token value.

  
Users with MUSK can also initiate governance proposals and vote. After the team deploys the smart contract, the token generated will be temporarily stored in the funding pool and gradually distributed to LP through liquidity mining. In addition, the official team will also participate in the LP process and provide MUSK with a value base through repurchase, lending and derivatives. After achieving cooperation with lending platform and other derivative platforms in the future, the team will return the income generated by this way to LP.

  
The ‚ÄúBEST+MUSK Dual-Coin‚Äù tokenomics will meet the needs of majority blockchain users. For new users who want to enjoy mining income, BEST can provide them with stable daily income through a simple ‚Äúholding-staking-benefit‚Äù process, without demanding any experience in traditional mining machine. The stable income can be further improved by staking MUSK. Compared with users who purchase cloud hashrate from a third-party website (such as NiceHash), BEST provides a more convenient, secure and decentralized way of cloud hashrate. To sum up, Defi + Hashrate token provide a broader application scenario for BEST.

  
Summary

  
With the strong bull market atmosphere in the cryptocurrency market in 2021, more and more users participate in the market. The more users are attracted, the more the project can expand its own ecology and form a benign cycle. Through the deep cooperation with F2pool, BEST not only realizing the anchoring with real hashrate, but also introduces other hashrate token through the F2pool in the future, which will expand the BEST application scenario and promote price increase. BEST can not only enjoy the price increase brought by the increase of mining income, but also improve the price increase expectation through liquidity mining, etc. The price of hashrate token BTCST has increased over 125 times. Compared with BTCST, BEST adds the anchoring to ETH hashrate, and is accessible on BSC chain. In the future, more assets will be anchored via F2pool.

  
Looking back on the blockchain market in 2014, Matthew Effect still exists.

  
The jaw-dropping increase of Dogecoin, Shibacoin has shocked people both inside and outside the blockchain industry. One of the features of the bull market in the middle and late period is to speculate on worthless tokens. If investors want to win in both the bull and bear market, those who has experienced a complete market cycle will invest BTC, ETH and other cryptocurrencies with sufficient value recognition. Few people who have experienced the thousands income return of the glorious 2014 and 2017 can survive to 2021. BEST is pegged to BTC and ETH through hashrate. Even in bear market, it can provide motivation for long-term holding and stable income for its holders, let alone the ‚Äú Davis Double Play ‚Äú of price increase and income increase in bull market. It is hoped that BEST, as a concept project of ‚ÄúMining + DeFi + NFT‚Äù, will push hashrate token to a new height. We believe that the BEST hashrate token will ride the wind and waves in the field of DeFi, and forge ahead!"
Help a newbie start into LPing,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/qblih8/help_a_newbie_start_into_lping/,Kormarg,1,2021-10-20 05:31:51,10,/r/defi/comments/qblih8/help_a_newbie_start_into_lping/,NaN,"Hi everyone,  
I am new to defi, but quite accustomed to ""traditional"" investments, with a finance major and a big interest for quant/factor investing.

I want to start LPing because it seems to me like a good way to diversify my other holdings in traditional markets.

Any case, I am considering two options but there is so much contradictory information I cannot settle on either of those:  


1 - LPing on stable coin on Curve Finance: Seems like people get a decent 6-10% yield based on the pool they chose, and exposure to the stable coin.

2 - LPing on Uniswap or similar on say ETH/DAI (I like both ETH and DAI), and get somewhere between 20-30% APY but with the risk of impermanent loss (and exposure to ETH and DAI which I don't mind at all.  


Question is:

a) Should I prefer 1 over 2, and why ?  
b) Are there better ways to implement either 1 or 2, on other platforms/networks/pairs or using other shenanigans.

Thank you !"

Q1

a)

According to the graph, the opportunity cost incurred by the economy  to increase its production of rice from 50 tons to 85 tons would be  25000-10000=15000 cars.

b)

According to the graph, only points on the production probability  curve utilises its existing resources efficiently. They would be point  B,C and D.

c)

Point a is above the production potential current, so using its  current resources cannot achieve combination A unless more resources are  borrowed.

d)

i)

Rainstorm will do harm to rice fields and increase the production  cost of rice, which can also be understood as the reduction of resources  for rice production. At the same time, the rainstorm may inundate the  automobile factory, which will increase the production cost of  automobiles, which can also be understood as the reduction of resources  used to produce automobiles. Therefore, the PPC curve will move to the  left and down as a whole.

ii)

If Japan relocates its car factories to higher ground, future floods  will mainly affect rice fields, increasing the production cost of rice.  It can also be understood as reducing the resources used to produce  rice, but almost without affecting the production of cars. Therefore,  the PPC curve moves to the left on the rice side, while the car side  remains basically unchanged.

Things To Watch Out for While Stepping in Yield Farming,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/qc0zsl/things_to_watch_out_for_while_stepping_in_yield/,PatriciaHarris_,1,2021-10-20 21:33:42,4,/r/defi/comments/qc0zsl/things_to_watch_out_for_while_stepping_in_yield/,NaN,"Although people on the internet make it sound as it is the perfect strategy to earn high interest, is it really safe? This is a question that I have always pondered on.

One of the most up-to-the-minute topics of this year is DeFi. As more and more investors continue to move towards cryptocurrency, the promise of DeFi is also starting to show. There is the option of crypto staking, the already-increasing prices of the currency, and yield farming; it all combines to create the perfect money pool to grab the attention of many investors. But with higher interests also comes higher risks.

Here are some risks that are associated with Yield Farming:

**1. Scam risks:** This can involve a situation where a third party calculatedly introduces risk into another person‚Äôs portfolio. Since the developer has control over your currency, there is a chance that they might end up running away with the liquidity control.

**2. Code risks:** This type of risk can include risks that aren‚Äôt in anyone‚Äôs control; i.e., unintentional bugs in the system. The developer can at times miss out on minor issues which can, later on, prove to be of huge loss.

**3. Ethereum fee risks:** These are risks introduced because of transaction or conversion fees. These risks aren‚Äôt as affecting major investors as they are too minor ones. One small error in the rounding-off can lead to huge losses for them.

The best chance to avoid any such risks is to always use a safe and secure platform. Here are some platforms that are safe and trusted by users:

**1. Yearn Finance**

It offers an exclusive yield farming and aggregation tool with an active development team working on new strategies to earn higher yields all the time. All this highly paid attention by developers makes it a safe-to-use platform.

**2. SmartCoin**

Smartcoin as we all know has always been the first choice of users all over. They KYC the user with RugDoc, liquidity is locked and both Paladin/Rugdoc audits peg them as low risk.

**3. Curve Finance**

It is the largest DEX with the most amount of value locked in. Therefore, the liquidity it offers is better than other platforms, which makes the transactions smooth and secure.

Can you tell some things that an investor should keep in mind while stepping into the world of yield farming?"

"De-Fi Insurance Protocol Solace, Backed by Polygon, NEAR, and Aave is Now Live",https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/qcaa1g/defi_insurance_protocol_solace_backed_by_polygon/,Mars_chego,1,2021-10-21 04:34:04,1,/r/defi/comments/qcaa1g/defi_insurance_protocol_solace_backed_by_polygon/,NaN,"Insurance-alternative protocol allows DeFi liquidity providers to hedge their risk in the event of smart contract exploits. [https://btcmanager.com/de-fi-insurance-protocol-solace-backed-by-polygon-near-and-aave-is-now-live/](https://btcmanager.com/de-fi-insurance-protocol-solace-backed-by-polygon-near-and-aave-is-now-live/)

Solace, a risk management insurance protocol for decentralized finance, has launched after eight months in development and four months on the Ethereum Rinkeby and Kovan testnets.

Entirely community-run, Solace offers coverage policies for DeFi protocols such as Aave, Compound, and Uniswap. Claims are instantly and automatically validated and claimed within the network, and payouts are made in a single transaction. Capital providers contribute to a single underwriting pool that is coming to multiple blockchains.

Solace aims to revolutionize the DeFi industry by providing investors with safety and security while contributing to the ecosystem. The protocol manages risk via intelligent assessment based on quantitative measures and analytics instead of voting, staking or other forms of ‚Äúcrowd wisdom‚Äù.

Supported by financial grants from the Polygon network, the NEAR Protocol, and Aave, Solace coverage policies are now available for the following DeFi protocols:

‚Äì Aave

‚Äì Compound

‚Äì Liquidity

‚Äì Yearn

‚Äì Curve Finance

‚Äì Uniswap V2 and V3

‚Äì Sushiswap

Eventually, Solace will have its own $SOLACE token to further decentralize the protocol‚Äôs governance, but the token will not be available at launch.

Standing out from traditional finance solutions, users can experience Solace while remaining entirely anonymous. The protocol doesn‚Äôt feature a KYC method and is entirely censorship-resistant. Solace is releasing with a launch version of its DAO, which includes members like the founders of Axie Infinity, Zerion, and Alchemy.

&gt;‚ÄúThere are a few points I really wanted to focus on. First is simplicity and usability. With Solace, you don‚Äôt have to understand how the protocol works ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù to use it, not even read the docs, just visit solace.fi and buy coverage, everything should be self explanatory without a knowledge barrier. Second is confidence in the claims assessment process. Claims processed by Solace are validated immediately and payouts happen in a single transaction, all thanks to our parametric automated system. Third is risk assessment. As a user I don‚Äôt trust the current mechanisms like voting, staking or market forces, in other words ‚Äúwisdom of the crowd‚Äù, to accurately evaluate risk exposures and predict losses. Solace is driven by an analytical approach and incentivizes intelligent risk assessment through an architecture where people can offer their risk assessment models and earn fees for managing risk,‚Äù said Solace Founder Nikita Buzov.

**About Solace**

Solace is a decentralized coverage protocol, insurance-alternative, that allows DeFi liquidity providers and market makers to hedge their risk in the event of smart contract exploits. Solace advances risk management of decentralized financial products by efficiently making coverage policies available to liquidity providers and other protocols.

 **TLDR**:

For crypto-entrepreneurs and long-term investors, yield farming works. But it is still a short-term incentive and not a long-term solution. So use this method with precaution.

 

# General Conclusion

Last week, we talked about a possibility of going back to the international gold standard by replacing gold with bitcoin. Today, we are talking about the agrarian society 2.0. I guess history really does repeat itself in new forms!

Today, we are talking about yield farming, the modern day agriculture. Instead of harvesting crops, we are harvesting tokens.

Yield farming is part of token distribution and user acquisition. It's basically mining tokens by using the protocol (i.e. executing trade). It's attractive because it's possible to get a 100% APY. But it comes with risks.

# 1. Projects Using Yield Farming

* **Sythetix**: issuing SNX tokens to liquidity provider. It worked since sETH tokens make up 1/3 of uniswap's liquidity pool
* **Curve Finance**: issue native tokens like SNX, REN, BAL, CRV to liquidity providers
* **Compound**: The total assets under Compound has surpassed Maker, the top DeFi app. It is the primary market for a decentralised money market. Daily COMP tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. It worked since 1 billion new assets entered the Compound market
* **Balancer**: Weekly BAL tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. Before the distribution, volume had generally been under $2 million. Since the distribution, it has generally been around $4 million. But on Sunday, June 28, volume shot up to $14 million.

# 2. Good Bad Ugly

\[**Good**\] **It works.** This native token is an **incentive for liquidity providers**. That is exactly what [exchange platforms](https://economicsdesign.substack.com/p/its-bye-or-buy-nance) are doing with their native tokens too, by incentivising market makers. It works for users because they are rewarded with extra tokens. It works of the platform because they are **onboarding new users**.

\[**Good**\] **Projects** like these are way **beyond** the stage of **just a white paper**. We have a working product that can be used and this is the first step towards getting a user base.

\[**Bad**\] This is **still a short-term incentive that is not sustainable**. What happens when the hype of trading is gone? Or when transaction fees are too expensive and it makes no economic sense to trade? Or when tokens are all given out?

\[**Bad**\] So far, it seems like the **yield is a zero-sum game**. If you don't know how to play, you should not participate. It may change in the future by increasing the size of pie, but for now, it is a beautiful zero sum. It means do not be the last sucker standing because you are going to suffer all the losses. If you don‚Äôt have insider knowledge or strategic advantage, you are not earning yield. You are the yield.

\[**Ugly**\] The real ugly part is the **hidden string attached**. Due to all the trade going on on ethereum, gas fees have shot through the roof. So **beware of gas fees, slippage fee, asset volatility.**

\[**Ugly**\] **Leveraged trading** can be good to secure greater upsides, but the downside can also be quite steep, especially since market is so volatile and you can get squeezed out quickly, if you have all your liquidity tied up in the the defi apps.

\[**Ugly**\] Because there are so many transactions (that may or may not be inflated), the transaction fees have soared. So, Ethereum is looking to i**ncrease the block size.** This is great for validators in the short run to increase their returns, but this is ugly risk in the long run because **ethereum network can be more vulnerable to attacks on the network.**

# 3. Economics of Yield Farming

* Token Design: Self-Reinforcing Mechanism. The token incentives create liquidity which starts a feedback loop.
* Valuation: at the end of the day, this method just encourages network effects without providing any real economic value. for protocols and projects to succeed, it depends on builders and users to stay on the platform for a long time, and not just during this movement. In the short term, we are also seeing an increase in token value.
* Token supply: this is a token supply increase, or supply inflation. It is also distributed to users with the highest volume. Instead of people paying for tokens, it is earned via the platform.
* Return of tokens: These tokens are not exactly free. early investors of the tokens have invested and receive tokens. they are happy for tokens to increase in value to cash out their returns. unless you have a strategic plan for using tokens to gain returns, you are just part of the plan. (Similar to IPO Pop)
* Transaction activities: borrowers are keen to borrow more because with the native token distribution, it is almost like they are subsidised to pay. The increase in trading results in higher transaction fees and attracts better returns as lenders.

# Apply To Your Project

This is a typical method for issuing tokens based on transaction volume, as we see in exchange tokens. Check out the BNB episode for the economics of that.

Yield farming is a growth hacking way to achieve network effects. It uses short-term incentives to drive user growth. At the end of the day, we are looking at the bigger game. In the long-run, how sustainable will the platform be. The real economic value comes from building products that benefits users in a sustainable manner, not with hypes and pumps. That means actual financial activity for DeFi protocols, so that monetary value increase is not just driven by ""sophisticated leveraged speculation"" but real value-add."

 **TLDR**:

For crypto-entrepreneurs and long-term investors, yield farming works. But it is still a short-term incentive and not a long-term solution. So use this method with precaution.

 

# General Conclusion

Last week, we talked about a possibility of going back to the international gold standard by replacing gold with bitcoin. Today, we are talking about the agrarian society 2.0. I guess history really does repeat itself in new forms!

Today, we are talking about yield farming, the modern day agriculture. Instead of harvesting crops, we are harvesting tokens.

Yield farming is part of token distribution and user acquisition. It's basically mining tokens by using the protocol (i.e. executing trade). It's attractive because it's possible to get a 100% APY. But it comes with risks.

# 1. Projects Using Yield Farming

* **Sythetix**: issuing SNX tokens to liquidity provider. It worked since sETH tokens make up 1/3 of uniswap's liquidity pool
* **Curve Finance**: issue native tokens like SNX, REN, BAL, CRV to liquidity providers
* **Compound**: The total assets under Compound has surpassed Maker, the top DeFi app. It is the primary market for a decentralised money market. Daily COMP tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. It worked since 1 billion new assets entered the Compound market
* **Balancer**: Weekly BAL tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. Before the distribution, volume had generally been under $2 million. Since the distribution, it has generally been around $4 million. But on Sunday, June 28, volume shot up to $14 million.

\[**Good**\] **It works.** This native token is an **incentive for liquidity providers**. That is exactly what [exchange platforms](https://economicsdesign.substack.com/p/its-bye-or-buy-nance) are doing with their native tokens too, by incentivising market makers. It works for users because they are rewarded with extra tokens. It works of the platform because they are **onboarding new users**.

\[**Good**\] **Projects** like these are way **beyond** the stage of **just a white paper**. We have a working product that can be used and this is the first step towards getting a user base.

\[**Bad**\] This is **still a short-term incentive that is not sustainable**. What happens when the hype of trading is gone? Or when transaction fees are too expensive and it makes no economic sense to trade? Or when tokens are all given out?

\[**Bad**\] So far, it seems like the **yield is a zero-sum game**. If you don't know how to play, you should not participate. It may change in the future by increasing the size of pie, but for now, it is a beautiful zero sum. It means do not be the last sucker standing because you are going to suffer all the losses. If you don‚Äôt have insider knowledge or strategic advantage, you are not earning yield. You are the yield.

\[**Ugly**\] The real ugly part is the **hidden string attached**. Due to all the trade going on on ethereum, gas fees have shot through the roof. So **beware of gas fees, slippage fee, asset volatility.**

\[**Ugly**\] **Leveraged trading** can be good to secure greater upsides, but the downside can also be quite steep, especially since market is so volatile and you can get squeezed out quickly, if you have all your liquidity tied up in the the defi apps.

\[**Ugly**\] Because there are so many transactions (that may or may not be inflated), the transaction fees have soared. So, Ethereum is looking to i**ncrease the block size.** This is great for validators in the short run to increase their returns, but this is ugly risk in the long run because **ethereum network can be more vulnerable to attacks on the network.**

# 3. Economics of Yield Farming

* Token Design: Self-Reinforcing Mechanism. The token incentives create liquidity which starts a feedback loop.
* Valuation: at the end of the day, this method just encourages network effects without providing any real economic value. for protocols and projects to succeed, it depends on builders and users to stay on the platform for a long time, and not just during this movement. In the short term, we are also seeing an increase in token value.
* Token supply: this is a token supply increase, or supply inflation. It is also distributed to users with the highest volume. Instead of people paying for tokens, it is earned via the platform.
* Return of tokens: These tokens are not exactly free. early investors of the tokens have invested and receive tokens. they are happy for tokens to increase in value to cash out their returns. unless you have a strategic plan for using tokens to gain returns, you are just part of the plan. (Similar to IPO Pop)
* Transaction activities: borrowers are keen to borrow more because with the native token distribution, it is almost like they are subsidised to pay. The increase in trading results in higher transaction fees and attracts better returns as lenders.

# 3. Economics of Yield Farming

* Token Design: Self-Reinforcing Mechanism. The token incentives create liquidity which starts a feedback loop.
* Valuation: at the end of the day, this method just encourages network effects without providing any real economic value. for protocols and projects to succeed, it depends on builders and users to stay on the platform for a long time, and not just during this movement. In the short term, we are also seeing an increase in token value.
* Token supply: this is a token supply increase, or supply inflation. It is also distributed to users with the highest volume. Instead of people paying for tokens, it is earned via the platform.
* Return of tokens: These tokens are not exactly free. early investors of the tokens have invested and receive tokens. they are happy for tokens to increase in value to cash out their returns. unless you have a strategic plan for using tokens to gain returns, you are just part of the plan. (Similar to IPO Pop)
* Transaction activities: borrowers are keen to borrow more because with the native token distribution, it is almost like they are subsidised to pay. The increase in trading results in higher transaction fees and attracts better returns as lenders.

# General Conclusion

Last week, we talked about a possibility of going back to the international gold standard by replacing gold with bitcoin. Today, we are talking about the agrarian society 2.0. I guess history really does repeat itself in new forms!

Today, we are talking about yield farming, the modern day agriculture. Instead of harvesting crops, we are harvesting tokens.

Yield farming is part of token distribution and user acquisition. It's basically mining tokens by using the protocol (i.e. executing trade). It's attractive because it's possible to get a 100% APY. But it comes with risks.

# 1. Projects Using Yield Farming

* **Sythetix**: issuing SNX tokens to liquidity provider. It worked since sETH tokens make up 1/3 of uniswap's liquidity pool
* **Curve Finance**: issue native tokens like SNX, REN, BAL, CRV to liquidity providers
* **Compound**: The total assets under Compound has surpassed Maker, the top DeFi app. It is the primary market for a decentralised money market. Daily COMP tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. It worked since 1 billion new assets entered the Compound market
* **Balancer**: Weekly BAL tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. Before the distribution, volume had generally been under $2 million. Since the distribution, it has generally been around $4 million. But on Sunday, June 28, volume shot up to $14 million.

It just announced creation of $350M grants for furthering DeFi on its chain.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcrn3d/near_protocol_is_about_to_explode_it_just/,CarbonatedInsidious,1,2021-10-21 21:19:09,16,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcrn3d/near_protocol_is_about_to_explode_it_just/,SPECULATION,"Near Protocol is an insanely scalable L1 chain which utilities sharding and is extremely developer friendly. It recently celebrated its one year mainnet launch and in just one year NEAR has full fledged DeFi applications and NFT marketplaces.

It has been backed by several notable names such as **a16z, Coinbase, Pantera Capital** etc.

Proximity Labs, a research and development firm, [announced](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/a16z-backed-blockchain-gets-350-million-grants-vehicle-for-defi)  the creation of a $350 million grants vehicle to help build decentralized-finance applications on the NEAR blockchain.

DeFi projects such as **Curve, Sushi, Dodo and Kyber** have launched or are in the process of doing so on NEAR‚Äôs blockchain.

While it‚Äôs price had been rising for quite some time, this just unlocked new price potential levels for NEAR.

This is exciting stuff!"
NEAR Protocol Announces $350M Grants to Expand dApp Ecosystem,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcrwdx/near_protocol_announces_350m_grants_to_expand/,AggravatingString,1,2021-10-21 21:32:29,3,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcrwdx/near_protocol_announces_350m_grants_to_expand/,ADOPTION,"[There was this announcement today I read on Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/a16z-backed-blockchain-gets-350-million-grants-vehicle-for-defi) about NEAR giving out $350 MILLION of grants and liquidity to applicants who want to create protocols in their ecosystem. It was interesting as it also mentioned a bunch of protocols I hadn‚Äôt come across before so I thought I‚Äôd do some research on them and figured I‚Äôd share what I found:

[REF Finance](https://app.ref.finance/)

REF I already knew and have a small bag. It‚Äôs NEAR‚Äôs premier blue chip DEX and runs on a central AMM just like Uniswap. The fact that transaction fees are between $0.001 and $0.002 NEAR obviously far outstrips Uniswap‚Äôs offering. Another feature is the fact multiple liquidity pools are in one contract which automatically chooses the cheapest route to enact a swap. These are two big upgrades on Uniswap already and means if NEAR continues its upward momentum I expect REF‚Äôs price to chase after it - just like Serum did when Solana crashed through the ceiling a few months back.

[Burrow Cash](https://twitter.com/burrowcash)

I think if you want to run smart contracts on the Cosmos network then Hyperledger Burrow is the answer. It‚Äôs native to NEAR, but as it can run as an EVM to integrate with Ethereum or use WASM to connect to Cosmos, it‚Äôs more flexible. Seems like a simple way for new enterprises to create the smart contracts it needs. 

[Onomy Protocol](https://onomy.io/)

This one I actually found the most interesting. Their medium is really well written, for one thing, which makes a pleasant change from some other projects I‚Äôve seen and shows they‚Äôve got a professional team already and they‚Äôre not messing about. It seems to be an institutional play to get the Forex market on-chain and all the benefits that it offers - fast finality, instant settlement yada yada. That‚Äôs a hell of a lot of money that might be flowing through Onomy Protocol before too long. They‚Äôre not launched yet but they‚Äôre doing a bonding curve offering which personally I‚Äôm in favour of - so this one I think is probably worth keeping an eye on.

[Trisolaris](https://medium.com/trisolaris-labs/trisolaris-is-near-6df2eb7f43ee)

I find this project both interesting and weird, and probably profitable. What Trisolaris has basically done is recreate the Ethereum experience, with fees paid in ETH and using products like Metamask, Wallet connect and Etherscan, but using the underlying NEAR layer 1 to offset all of Ethereum‚Äôs drawbacks. If NEAR keeps pumping, then I think it has the opportunity to hook users of the Ethereum mainnet as knowledge about NEAR grows.

I think all four of these native NEAR projects may blow up if NEAR continues its trend. What do you think? REF and Trisolaris are aiming to capture Ethereum‚Äôs market share - do you think they will? 

Official PR seems to be this:

**September was hot. And October is getting hotter.**

If you thought that summer‚Äôs decline was the kiss of death to the market and the start of another year-long crypto winter ‚Äî you were wrong. As many times before, Autumn is the month when it usually only gets hotter. The world passed the point of no return in the digital assets last year.

September was a rough road for the cryptocurrency industry. Having started with another NFT boom and 101 NFTs from [**Bored Ape Yacht Club being sold for $24.4 million**](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664469/bored-ape-yacht-club-sothebys-auction-amount) at a Sotheby‚Äôs auction, it reached the bottom with another round of FUD from China, which has [**banned Bitcoin**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2021/09/28/china-bitcoin-ban-crypto-massive-blow/?sh=3f9509b36ede). Once again.

Anyway, who really cares anymore? The signs of adoption are looming on the horizon, reassuring us that cryptocurrency is ripe for further record-breaking growth within months. Pretty much like in 2020, institutional adoption opens a gateway to rate growth that was considered unreal some years ago.

First, Twitter [**added Bitcoin (BTC) donation option**](https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2015/apr/17/twitter-donate-charity-hashtag) that allows Bitcoin donations to be sent. Next, Switzerland‚Äôs stock exchange received [**regulatory approval**](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/swiss-bourse-gets-regulatory-approval-for-digital-asset-exchange.html) to launch the digital exchange that might enable it to stay ahead of major exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange as cryptocurrency becomes more popular with heavyweight companies.

In early August, SEC chief Gary Gensler [**stressed**](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/experts-say-sec-approval-for-a-bitcoin-etf-wont-happen-any-time-soon.html) that a compliant ETF could be approved. The official subsequently confirmed that ETFs based on cryptocurrency derivatives have a chance to receive the green light from the Commission. And the crypto community is excited about it.

In the meantime, more households are adopting crypto in leading countries. As indicated in the report by CNBC, the results from a poll conducted by CNBC and the American chemical company Momentive show that more than 10% of people in the USA [**are actively investing**](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/18/new-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-user-global-map.html) in cryptocurrencies. Quite a staggering figure, taking into account that some twenty years ago, even Internet adoption in the U.S. was nearly the same!

We at Zunami encourage you to learn more about cryptocurrencies. Don‚Äôt be afraid to take a step into the digital finance world ‚Äî otherwise, one day, you might find yourself on the outskirts of modern life.

**Zunami‚Äôs Battle Report**

We‚Äôre thrilled to share the first cryptocurrency battle report! In September, the Zunami team did a great job in several directions. We completely remade the website, published a new product concept, launched new socials, and created a brand new video about the Decentralized Revenue Protocol! Not to mention the publications in the press. Our community has grown from a few hundred supporters to thousands!

The project‚Äôs development has entered the final stage on the tech side, and the Alpha version will be available on the website in the coming weeks. Moreover, smart contracts were both written and tested. The development department is engaged in the integration of [**Graph**](https://thegraph.com/en/) and [**Gelato**](https://www.gelato.com/) protocols.

Our team is also actively issuing updates once a week on [**Github**](https://github.com/ZunamiLab/ZunamiProtocol/tree/dev). We kept our community informed throughout September and will continue doing so later on.

We remind you that one‚Äôs path in DeFi is a road of insecurity. We also value our supporters who helped us in the turbulent times **‚Äî** when we have built our up-and-coming protocol from scratch.

Things To Watch Out for While Stepping in Yield Farming,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyTrading/comments/qd0a85/things_to_watch_out_for_while_stepping_in_yield/,LeomaDegnan,1,2021-10-22 04:09:40,1,/r/CryptoCurrencyTrading/comments/qd0a85/things_to_watch_out_for_while_stepping_in_yield/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

Although people on the internet make it sound as it is the perfect strategy to earn high interest, is it really safe? This is a question that I have always pondered on.

One of the most up-to-the-minute topics of this year is DeFi. As more and more investors continue to move towards cryptocurrency, the promise of DeFi is also starting to show. There is the option of crypto staking, the already-increasing prices of the currency, and yield farming; it all combines to create the perfect money pool to grab the attention of many investors. But with higher interests also comes higher risks.

Here are some risks that are associated with Yield Farming:

**1. Scam risks:** This can involve a situation where a third party calculatedly introduces risk into another person‚Äôs portfolio. Since the developer has control over your currency, there is a chance that they might end up running away with the liquidity control.

**2. Code risks:** This type of risk can include risks that aren‚Äôt in anyone‚Äôs control; i.e., unintentional bugs in the system. The developer can at times miss out on minor issues which can, later on, prove to be of huge loss.

**3. Ethereum fee risks:** These are risks introduced because of transaction or conversion fees. These risks aren‚Äôt as affecting major investors as they are too minor ones. One small error in the rounding-off can lead to huge losses for them.

The best chance to avoid any such risks is to always use a safe and secure platform. Here are some platforms that are safe and trusted by users:

**1. Yearn Finance**

It offers an exclusive yield farming and aggregation tool with an active development team working on new strategies to earn higher yields all the time. All this highly paid attention by developers makes it a safe-to-use platform.

**2. SmartCoin**

Smartcoin as we all know has always been the first choice of users all over. They KYC the user with RugDoc, liquidity is locked and both Paladin/Rugdoc audits peg them as low risk.

**3. Curve Finance**

It is the largest DEX with the most amount of value locked in. Therefore, the liquidity it offers is better than other platforms, which makes the transactions smooth and secure.

Can you tell some things that an investor should keep in mind while stepping into the world of yield farming?"

**Plian Labs**

Crypto¬†is currently at the diving line¬†between information attributes¬†and financial attributes. Information attributes refer to the extent to which blockchain as a technology really affects the Internet. Can it change the long-term relationship between merchants, users, and middlemen? The¬†financial attributes are currently in a booming situation, and the transaction volume¬†of DeFi¬†and return value are undoubtedly the right scene¬†of on-chain finance. In the early days, our¬†understanding of crypto finance was coin trading. Financing services were the largest application scenario of financial blockchainÔºö¬†IDO, STO¬†and IEO all brought the first cash flow to various projects.

Layer 2 is gradually succeeding Layer 1. As the transaction volume on the chain increases, the security and speed requirements of the network are becoming more and more stringent. In the past, most of the DApps¬†were highly hypothetical. It was assumed that users embraced the scenes imagined by the platform, that the technology was flawless, that the commercial barriers were extremely high, and that the traditional Internet could not solve the pain points raised by the application. When it really reaches more users, these fragile assumptions are difficult to be considered, and the technical strength is the same.

At present, the crypto world¬†are facing a problem: except for the transfer of Layer 1 assets to Layer 2, how do assets on different chains circulate? What can be used to achieve intercommunication between different ecosystems, and can there be a unified standard?

Developers are used to comparing the importance of cross-chain with the TCP/IP of the Internet, precisely because TCP/IP provides a standard for different networks all over the globe. It has standardized how the data should be packaged, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received at the destination, so that global terminals are connected into one¬†net, while¬†local networks in the original structure can also exchange information and assets.

Are cross-net standards not suitable for cross-chain? Is the necessity of cross-chain urgent?

**Fragmentation** **&amp; Isolation**

With the maturity of 5G ,¬†AI, VR, AR, and IoT, many circuits in the digital industry have shown their own abilities and have moved forward one by one. New technological scenarios of¬†the traditional Internet are still in the early stages. There are still many scenarios between AI and IoT that are not yet connected, and the interaction between many applications with a daily activity of less than one million is almost zero. On-chain applications with AI or Games as the main prospects, their ecosystem¬†is basically in a state of fragmentation. Each of them is like¬†an isolated island.

The eco-fragmentation of the blockchain means that with¬†the rapid development of the blockchain technology, the expansion of business models and transaction volume, and many problems will follow. Different public chains cannot be connected and interoperable due to technology, ecosystem, competition and other reasons. This has brought about the fragmentation of users, assets, applications, and data, forming an ‚ÄúIsland Effect.‚Äù

Cross-chain has always been one of the difficult problems of the blockchain, because it involves multiple factors such as data intercommunication, consensus conversion, and governance coordination. There has been no unified standard for different blockchain systems in terms of communication protocol, identity management, consensus mechanism, etc. It also increases the difficulty of cross-chain intercommunication. In addition to technical standards, the consensus between different communities is also different, and the subject of assets is also different. Compared with cross-net, the problem that cross-chain¬†needs to solve has one more dimension‚Äìasset transfer.

**Quantitative Changes Brought by DeFi**

According to data from DApp Radar, the amount of DeFi locked up in the past year has surged from around $10 billion to the current $112.1 billion, reaching a peak of $116.4 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xwr703qg4vu71.png?width=541&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0008ca61cb88813570ab7069d58f1ae772431c8

A set of data released by nonfungible.com recently shows that the transaction volume of NFT has also made a significant breakthrough in the past 6 months. The transaction volume of OpenSea exceeded $2 billion in September.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iqhxocii4vu71.png?width=537&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a2376db7f2262ec441b8269a334420165ab522c

Motivated by liquidity mining, DeFi exploded on Ethereum. With the increase in transaction volume, the high transaction fee of Ethereum once became an important factor restricting its eco-development, which also objectively promoted the arrival of multi-chain era. Another reason is that different communities have different views on the development of the crypto market, and their beliefs are also different. Most community organizations advocate starting from zero, building a chain to ‚Äúchange the world‚Äù, and managing the crowd with tokens. This is DAO.

Crypto is not just a technology, it is also an Internet native economy, community DAO = DeFi infrastructure + NFT business model + contributors. The DAO is the native company structure of some crypto-economy, and its members gradually fit into the community and become an important element of the community. Members and tokens influence each other and are inseparable from the overall value of the platform. The platform gradually gains huge and long-term value.

**Qualitative Changes Brought by MetaVerse &amp; Web3**

The game ‚ÄúFortnite‚Äù developed by Epic Game is advancing entertainment activities similar to MetaVerse. Ariana Grande concerts are held in the game, attracting tens of millions of people from all over the world. The MeatVerse is the ultimate form of the Internet in the future. It may gradually weaken the role of human beings on the earth as described by \[The Matrix\], and gradually migrate the entire human civilization to the virtual world. Like \[Free Guy\] has imagined, the protagonist of the Internet is still humans, not AI. With the help of VR glasses, MetaVerse can run another set of things that cannot exist in the real world, or something has already gone in the real world. The MetaVerse may be all the forms currently supported by AI, AR, and VR, or it may be presented in other forms.

However, there is a question: can every building, every character, and every identity created in MetaVerse be copied and pasted at will? Is ownership unique? After the emergence of NFT, everything has an answer, and the asset attributes and uniqueness of digital works are marked through non-fungible-tokens. This is also one of the main reasons for the outbreak of the NFT market in 2021. However, the explosion of the MetaVerse finally took the crypto world to another level. The blockchain and the offline economy are now more deeply bound, and a new door is suddenly opened. The future of the crypto market is also expected to be Web 3.0.

First of all, for the Web 1, Web 2 platform, that is, the traditional centralized Internet platform, Chris Dixon, a16z partner, once described it as follows:

‚ÄúCentralized platforms follow a predictable life cycle. At first, they did everything possible to recruit users and third-party supplements, such as creators, developers, and companies.

‚ÄúAs the parameters of the platform move on the adopted S-curve, the parameters of their control over users and third parties are also steadily increasing.

When they reach the top of the S-curve, their relationship with network participants will change from a positive-sum relationship to a zero-sum relationship. In order to continue to grow, they have to extract data from users and compete with (previous) partners. ‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v6wcsf7k4vu71.png?width=496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1543861914fbb878455c71d37686d3c177c3e8b3

This contradiction is becoming more and more obvious. The well-known examples are: Microsoft vs. Netscape, Google vs. Yelp, Facebook vs. Zynga, and Epic Games vs. Apple Inc not long ago.

The obvious trend of the primary Web 3 platform is that users have very strong autonomy and attach great importance to the ownership and interests, which is not felt in the Web 2.0 era. We can see is the Web3 ecosystem led by the DAO organization: members contribute content, there is no fixed management organization, and all decisions are made by members voting. The current performance in the blockchain field is relatively prominent. Perhaps that time was also when MetaVerse deeply touces the audience. At present, many public chains such as Ethereum and Plian can be regarded as a decentralized global computer owned and operated by the community.

Web3.0 implements basic functions such as data storage, privacy protection, and identity authentication through the protocol layer. Web 3.0 is user-autonomous, and the motivation for all this is also because of the decentralized network, so that the maximum of digital assets belongs to creators and rights holders. Web 3.0 attempts to solve the problems of profit distribution and resource circulation accumulated in the period of Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. The breakthrough lies in users. Only when hundreds of millions of users begin to understand how to control their own information and rights, can the Internet truly gain order. Crypto just came out because of the same mission!

**Asset Activity**

Most public chain assets that we are familiar with can be exchanged at real-time prices, and there is not much contact, let alone interaction. This attribute of NFT assets is also very strong. In the initial stage, each NFT can only be regarded as a digital collection, and its value will not be affected due to any changes in the community. After the popularity of Loot, everyone saw the creative passion of DAO, with community building as the main driving force, and left the development direction of the platform and the value growth of individual works to the community members to decide. And every NFT work is connected, and they form a complete system.

This is not just an innovation in a business model, but also a change in the consciousness of the crypto world. That is to say, in addition to each community member‚Äôs initiative to contribute to the community and build a MetaVerse for themselves, there is also a very important point ‚Äî whether it is a NFT or a fungible token, they do not need to be isolated islands, but can interact each other.

This goes back to what was mentioned at the beginning of the article. Is the cross-network standard not suitable for cross-chain? Is the necessity of cross-chain urgent?

**What Will Bridge Bring to Us**

You can see a set of data comparisons from Dune Analytics

* The recent development of cross-chain bridges is sofast, and the TVL¬†amount in the last 30 days has increased by more than 35%;
* The currentTVL¬†amount of 14 cross-chain bridges has reached approximately $18 billion, which is currently about 6.26% of TVL¬†amount of DeFi;
* The total TVLvolume of the Ethereum Bridge has soared in the past 6¬†months, with the TVL of Polygon Bridges being the most prominent;
* When it comes to specific market shares, several top projects account for half of the country.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zykrz7ll4vu71.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54cf58f7e36815b3995ce750442940680fb9300b

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xw2nw2jn4vu71.png?width=572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2d9a9aa46775565bd5e894b36550016536f7dba

This is indeed the TVL¬†amount of the crypto¬†bridge, indicating that users are more inclined to choose the Ethereum bridge when it comes to asset issues. On the one hand, cross-net standards are not suitable for cross-chain,¬†because the bottom layer of the chain is completely distributed, and it is difficult to use centralized standards to standardize decentralized net.

Many Layer 1 blockchains need to use bridges to connect to any other system. Cross-chain bridges occupy an important position in asset extradition and are therefore very valuable. The cross-chain bridge is to provide a channel between 2¬†different chains to host the original assets on this bridge. At the same time, one chain can obtain the asset transaction status on the other through the oracle function, mapping according to the ratio of 1:1 to another chain. The effect of cross-chain bridge formation is to allow 2¬†chains to circulate the same asset. The assets¬†crossing the chains¬†are mapped from the original assets. For example, BETH is the mapping asset of ETH crossing¬†to BSC through Binance Bridge. Usually the Layer2 team will provide official cross-chain bridges, and security is the biggest advantage.

The bridge should meet the following basic conditions to help projects, public chains, wallets, etc. to cross¬†the chains¬†and then¬†achieve decentralized circulation between different ecosystems:

* support the cross-chain and circulation of ecological assets of any heterogeneous chain and homogeneous chain
* compatible with various cross-chain technologies and standards
* realize the interoperability of blockchain applications between different chains

**1.Interaction between** **Chains**

The initial purpose of cross-chain is to solve the problem of eco-islands that has been emphasized in this paper, and to open up the data isolation state between various public chains. Assets can‚Äôt be exchanged on the chain, resources can‚Äôt flow, and even the same person has different identities in different ecosystems. On the one hand, this will increase the bubble in the crypto industry; on the other hand, the asset activity will continue to decline until the end of the economic system collapse, because the assets on the chain will not have continuous resources, ideas, and comprehensive information input.

At present, most of the¬†cross-chain bridges on the market are mostly¬†2-layer extended cross-chain bridges, and they are mainly built on Ethereum. In addition, there are some chain-specific cross-chain bridges, which are mainly aimed at achieving interconnection with Ethereum.

**2.Cross-chain of DeFi** **Assets**

The most important part of cross-chain business is cross-chain of tokens.¬†Especially in the DAO era, not only the structure of the currency system or trading platform is gradually decentralized, but also the group organization is slowly becoming weaker. When centralized management is completely weakened, the demand for DeFi¬†will become higher and higher. The applicable fields include NFT transactions, games and LP swaps. With the increase in transaction volume, the transaction fees of a certain public chain will rise, and the security and speed will be weakened. Regardless of whether it is due to the¬†the share of¬†pressure or cutting the market pie, the trend of multi-chain advancing is inevitable, and the proposition of cross-chain will become bigger and bigger.

At present, many cross-chain bridges use the smart contract model. Due to the security vulnerabilities of smart contracts, hacker attacks frequently occur. Smart contracts may be a good solution for small cross-chain scenarios, but there are many situations where you still need to choose public chain cross-chain. When users need to transfer chain assets between chains, multi-signature is a quite right solution.

Each user‚Äôs address is independent, the transaction and fund details of the Pbridge cross-chain process are completely visible on the chain, and the cross-chain process of any asset is completely transparent to ensure the safety of user‚Äôs assets and nothing centralized process.

At the same time, the NFT project initiated in 2021 tends to create NFT on Layer 2. NFT is only used to mark the right and value of digital creations. If it stays at the auction stage, the problem is not big. But when it comes to the secondary market, L2 NFT can‚Äôt migrate to L1, which leads to the problem of NFT islands, and the importance of cross-chain bridges is conspicuous once again.

**About PBridge**

PBridge is a cross-chain bridge officially launched by Plian Layer2, which are mainly used to solve the problem between Plian L1 chain and L2 chain(internal), as well as between Plian and other chains (external, such as BTC, Ethereum, Binance smart chain, Dfinity, etc.). The circulation of assets between them and cross-chain interoperability¬†are all linked by PBridge.¬†According to the classification of mechanisms for verifying cross-chain transactions, PBridge is a native verification. ¬†The biggest advantage¬†of PBridge¬†is high security. The technical architecture¬†of¬†belongs to the Sidechain/Relayer mechanism. At the same time, it has pioneered the integration of Sidechain and Relayer, while reducing message communication¬†and the loss rate of cross-chain, and improving the overall cross-chain performance.

PBridge is developed based on Cosmos-sdk and inherits cosmos‚Äôs native IBC cross-chain protocol, which can seamlessly connect to the Cosmos network and support lightweight adaptation to various heterogeneous blockchain networks. The PBridge¬†adopts a variety of pluggable cross-chain message signature confirmation mechanisms (supports multi-signature, secure multi-party calculation, etc.), which is fast and safe. It also supports multi-currency protocols (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, etc.)¬†to meet the characteristics of asset information interaction, security and compatibility with the protocols, applications, and transactions on various public chains.

There are 2 DApps on Plian: decentralized exchange Paiswap and NFT trading platform Pizzap. After Paiswap launching, many users have encountered technical problems around assets transfering between L1 and L2. The core reason is that, in addition to the current technology limitation of crypto, cross-chain user education is actually a problem worthy of careful consideration. At the same time, the scale of cross-chain assets is also getting larger and larger, and it has become the favorite target of hackers. In August of this year(2021), a cross-chain application was hacked by a security incident‚Äì O3 Swap was stolen 160 million dollars, which caused panic in the entire industry. In comparison, PBridge‚Äôs technical support will always pay most attention on security.

In the later period of Paiswap, in addition to the PBridge, the aggregation protocol will also be used to realize the liquidity of assets between different chains. Through the cross-chain protocol to create a cross-chain transaction pool, Paiswap Hub, users can realize the transaction of different blockchain assets through it, or they can choose to provide liquidity for the cross-chain pool to obtain PNFT rewards. When users actually ‚Äúcross the chain‚Äù, most cross-chain protocols can only realize the circulation of the same asset between different chains. But Paiswap can realize the circulation of different assets between different chains, that is, token X is transferred out of A network, and token Y is received on B network.

**End**

In 2020, the explosion of the DeFi market has brought new strengths to public chains: user confidence, gameplay, traditional financial market resources, and decentralized players‚Äô brainpower. In 2021, the prosperity of NFT trading and the popularity of MetaVerse have given blockchain practitioners a lot of new ideas: DAO is forming a new economy, and the game‚Äôs economic system is appropriately migrating to the MetaVerse. A unified message is that the capital market has been sparing no effort in the crypto market.

Just like the thinking brought by DeFi, more funds, more transaction volume, and more crypto members joining means a greater test of security and speed, as well as the consequent increase in transaction costs. It is the reason why cross-chain is beginning to get attention. Reversely, when the cross-chain bridge solves the problems of security, speed, and Asset Activity for the public chain, will it be possible to usher in a new round of explosions for the crypto market? Maybe many new stories will happen from the application side.

I apologize to the Sub for the duplicity

Firstly, I‚Äôm not an IT guy and I don‚Äôt even play one on TV, but I‚Äôm no slouch either, when it comes to computers.  Here are my thoughts, for what they‚Äôre worth, take it or leave it - it's totally up to you. 

Now, I usually replace my Mac every two years (I‚Äôm a full time Mixing Engineer) and the macs in the studio get upgraded down the line, with mine replacing the next one down, etc. I don't think I will need to do so in two years, to keep ahead of the curve, as I like to - but that's me.

I‚Äôve been holding off, waiting for the M1‚Äôs successor, for I didn‚Äôt think it wise to get a first generation chip and a 16 Gig RAM limit. M1‚Äôs, it turns out, are absolutely great and have proven themselves handsomely as an Intel slayer, even a Mac Pro slayer, in many instances, with only 16G Integrated RAM, for around a year now, at the time of this writing. Some reviewers have posted some small limits of the 16 G/RAM, nothing serious, but they are there.  

I have to believe there are some things that apple‚Äôs developers learned from the M1, that they would do differently in the next generation, so I waited. But again, that‚Äôs me, and I ordered a 16‚Äù 64G 2TB  M1 Max MBP. 

**Cant Afford One?**

Then this is an awesome time to get an M1 16 Gig Mac Second hand, because all of those whom are early adopters, which I feel are most Logic users, are dying to get rid of their M1's, so they can order an M1 Pro or Max. There will be a flood of M1's for sale, and with so many soon available, wait for the prices to go down a bit, and buy. 

Me? I am not an early adopter, for I've been stung by that bug before, and won't again. I don't need the latest features of Logic to Mix; I don't need the latest Mac OS to Mix, so I'm content with Mojave and Logic 10.4.4 being solid as a rock. Unfortunately 10.4.4 won't work on apple silicon, so I need to make a leap of faith here. A scary leap. 

I'm clearing my schedule for 3 weeks, to allow the IT guy I use  transfer all of the computers but mostly, to learn what bugs are biting, with the latest versions if Logic and OS.  I won't put myself in a position to possibly miss a deadline, and have explained this to my regular clients phone or email and got appreciative replies! It always pays to be honest!  

But for serious workstations, 16 G/RAM is a bit anemic. Tho it will work well for now, you don't buy a Mac for now; you buy it for a decade worth of use. 3+ years ago, 16G/RAM was considered a smoking Mac. It is not anymore. Those with pre-M1's, and some with M1's, feel the pinch of the limited RAM

An M1 with 16 gigs rocks for most right now, but investing in a computer that is spec'd for today, isn't future-proofing yourself. 

**Why the Divide**

PC users,  often look at it an M1 and say, ‚Äú$$$ with only 16 Gig RAM, why that hardly enough for anything‚Äù. Or, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs how much and it‚Äôs just an XYZ cpu‚Äù. The way OSX handles itself makes incredible use of 16G with an M1. A PC can‚Äôt do anything serious with only 16G.

PC users usually look at the components to judge a Mac, solely by the cost and/or specs of components, and don‚Äôt know how to consider the performance aspect that Mac can achieve with those components. Not all PC users, but most of them, I find. Thus the divide. 

Today, 16 Gig is insignificant in the PC world, if you want a serious workstation, you're looking at 256 or more popular, 512 G/RAM. Yet M1‚Äôs, with only 16G RAM, kicks everyone‚Äòs butt, today. Again, it's in the performance. Now, with M1 Pro and M1Max released, Mac just doubled down. 

**Is 16 gig enough for today? Probably so; in 3 years, not so much.** 

Will it be even relevant in five years? I'm guessing probably not and anyone whom buys a new Mac with only 16 G/RAM is not thinking about future-proofing. So let‚Äôs dig deeper into why we would want 32 or 64 Gig of Ram in a Mac workstation. 

In 2015 w/16G RAM was considered a smoking MacBook; in 2018 people were flocking to 32 G/RAM Macs. 

*The single biggest slowdown when using Logic*, and probably any DAW, is the handling of memory.  Handling of the data in RAM. More specifically, *handling of the data that doesn't fit in RAM - the overflow.*

As OSX grew in physical size, with Mac‚Äôs FREE OS UPGRADES, but more importantly, it grew in the amount of RAM it uses, (tho I read a post that claimed Big Sur had a smaller footprint, I can‚Äôt seem to verify it) and as Logic offers more and more features FOR FREE, they naturally take up more and more RAM when you use those features. (Windows grew in size too, with the $130 Windows 11 Home Edition requiring 64 Gig of storage for the software and updates)

We also need to consider all operations going on in the background, such as Time Machine, File Vault and other electives, plus mandatory processes that OS needs to do. 

**Where does it go?**

The overflow - what does not fit into 16G, gets written to the internal drive, in the form of a Swap File (a/k/a virtual memory file). This shuffling of what data is in RAM, moving to the internal hard drive and from the internal hard drive, to RAM, *is the single biggest slowdown in Logic*. 

When you go to Mix, and all of your files are now audio files, it is up to your RAM to play it. If it doesn't fit all of it in RAM, then it will need to supplement with the data on your swap file. 

This is how Mac, (and Windows) deals with RAM overflow. I understand apple‚Äôs M1 series silicon also helps with this, with the RAM integrated onto the chip, along with the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, Encyclopedia Britannica and a kitchen sink! It is evidently a faster way to move data, but I‚Äôm not yet fluent in exactly how it helps utilize the RAM better, beyond speed. There is a significant speed increase, due to the faster On Chip connections, vs having the RAM conventionally sit in another part of the motherboard. I just don't know how it affects the Swapping of Data with your Internal Drive's Swap File. I know what I know, I know some of what I don't know and the more I know, the more I know I don't know.

Windows sets a predetermined amount of space aside on the internal drive, reserved to use for this Virtual Memory File, Mac‚Äôs Swap File is dynamic and will utilize the free space available in the best ways. 

FREE UP FREE SPACE

You need to make sure you have left a considerable amount of open room on your internal drive. 

If you don‚Äôt have a lot of free space on your internal HD, there will be a bunch of shuffling going on, almost all of the time. This can slow you down significantly and bring up Overload Errors. That‚Äôs why Logic, and most, DAWs, rely on large amounts of RAM, to avoid overflow. 

The processing power is what plugins use, as they are apps. Many of them will take its settings, and make a static file, or turns into a static app, that does what it‚Äôs set for, without needing much processing power, freeing up the processor and putting itself, in a static mode, into RAM. There are more than just these examples of Data Swapping while using Logic, it is the number 1 thing that slows Logic down. It is why, if you have an internal HDD (mechanical), you would hear it chatter, even when you haven't done anything in the last several minutes. OS predicts what you will need to feed to RAM and the CPU and does its best job doing so. 

Because so much of Logic is already in the OS (the DAW and OS uniquely written by the same company) RAM goes so much further on a Mac, just like how macs get such great performance out of an i5, as compared to a PC. 

**How Much Room On My Internal Hard Drive Do I Need?**

As I often work on rather large files, I keep 80-120G free.  I would recommend that most Logic users keep about 40-50 gig free, at all times. The more that‚Äôs free, the less shuffling of your data will occur, as OS serves up the data that will likely be needed next.  

I am adding the most RAM I can. I'm counting on the historic processing power of the M1 Max to  manage my plugins just fine, allowing me to keep a good amount of plugins open, along with not having to freeze too many files. 

A poster returned his M1 because he expected that they can keep all of the plugins open. He evidently misunderstood Best Practices. We will always need to use Best Practices. The reality is, there is still a ‚Äòwall‚Äô you can hit, it‚Äôs just a several miles down the road with 64 G/RAM, compared to a 16 G/RAM system, having it 1,000 feet down the road. Best Practice are still going to be advantages, such as freezing files, bouncing in place, etc. if you are dealing with large files.

No matter how much RAM you have; no matter how much processing power you have, there is still an end to it and that is a wall that can be hit. Hard to do today, with M1 Max, I‚Äôm sure, but I‚Äôm still going to keep to Best Practices, freezing all I easily can, bouncing in place what I easily can, and everything else that I can do to keep a project neat and clean, for a neat and clean file will always run smoother. 

As well, tho this isn‚Äôt widely a concern, but I may need to transfer a project somewhere, where they don‚Äôt have an M1 MAX @ 64G - their 16 Gig M1 might not handle a project that isn‚Äôt ‚Äòneatened up‚Äô. You may have a need to share a project with your Mix Engineer, or someone else. Neat files play best.

The M1 is even blowing away many Mac Pro‚Äôs now, so if I need to send a project to someone with a Mac Pro, and it‚Äôs a swollen project, the Mac Pro might not handle it!

So the question isn‚Äôt whether 16 or 32 gigs will suffice for Logic, for it certainly will and will do a stellar job...... today. But will it suffice in four years from now, with Logic 11.5.  How about seven years from now, with Logic 12 and Mac‚Äôs new OS, named Unobtainium, that needs 32 gig minimum. 

Now, I‚Äôm pulling those Logic and OS versions and dates out of my butt to exemplify my point. But it raises the question: at what point will the RAM start to overflow and need to be relieved by the much slower virtual memory file?

So yes, Logic will jet through a M1 Max w/32 gig. But you, like most Mac users, want to get 10 years out of their Mac, and that is a totally achievable goal with Mac. They have a history of releasing OS‚Äôs that help keep older Mac‚Äôs going, including security patches for older OS‚Äôs, while releasing newer OS‚Äôs for newer Macs also. 

So the question is really, will 64 G Ram help your Mac reach reach years 8, 9 &amp;10. Certainly - it's clear to me that it would. If those 2015 Macs were 8 G/RAM instead of 16 Gig, it probably wouldn‚Äôt be usable for Logic today. 

I see 64 gig of RAM on the M1 Max as future-proofing and a wise investment that also gooses your performance all along the way, for its going to be harder to overflow the RAM. If you need to cut back something, cut back the hard drive, for you can supplement that with external Thunderbolt Drives. Apps alone aren't that big. Logic is huge at 2-3 Gigs. You can fill your drive up with all of your apps and take up less than 256 G.

How many cores - well, the most you can get because you can't add them later! If your credit is worthy, financing it through an Apple Card, at zero percent interest, and saving a hundred and something bucks as well with their 3% discount, lets you buy for the same price, spread the payments out and get a discount on your purchase 

So, it makes sense to get what you can afford, and then, perhaps, finance the rest at zero percent interest to get a 10 year, best performance Workstation.  

&amp;#x200B;

So here is my Clear As Mud proclamation, for this post:

\- The more RAM you have,

\- The less overflow you‚Äôll get, 

\- The less data swapping will happen, 

\- The faster Logic will be!

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this helps and best endeavors with your choice of Macs!"

So the question is really, will 64 G Ram help your Mac reach reach years 8, 9 &amp;10. Certainly - it's clear to me that it would. If those 2015 Macs were 8 G/RAM instead of 16 Gig, it probably wouldn‚Äôt be usable for Logic today. 

I see 64 gig of RAM on the M1 Max as future-proofing and a wise investment that also gooses your performance all along the way, for its going to be harder to overflow the RAM. If you need to cut back something, cut back the hard drive, for you can supplement that with external Thunderbolt Drives. Apps alone aren't that big. Logic is huge at 2-3 Gigs. You can fill your drive up with all of your apps and take up less than 256 G.

How many cores - well, the most you can get because you can't add them later! If your credit is worthy, financing it through an Apple Card, at zero percent interest, and saving a hundred and something bucks as well with their 3% discount, lets you buy for the same price, spread the payments out and get a discount on your purchase 

So, it makes sense to get what you can afford, and then, perhaps, finance the rest at zero percent interest to get a 10 year, best performance Workstation.  

&amp;#x200B;

So here is my Clear As Mud proclamation, for this post:

\- The more RAM you have,

\- The less overflow you‚Äôll get, 

\- The less data swapping will happen, 

\- The faster Logic will be!

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this helps and best endeavors with your choice of Macs!"

**RushNet, Inc**  with its subsidiaries heliosDX and Grandeza Healthcare 

* **would like to issue a companywide 'Letter to Shareholders'**.

Over the last 7 months, Rushnet, Inc has made several attempts 

* **to formulate a plan** to restructure the outstanding and authorized share structure. 

In addition, RushNet, Inc has **targeted several key acquisitions** to bring substantial revenues and assets into the business. 

# The Company has been able to close on these key acquisitions. 

The first was heliosDX in July 2021, in exchange for a new Convertible Preferred B and the second in August 2021 for Grandeza Healthcare in exchange for 300,000,000 outstanding shares.

Initially, RushNet, Inc wanted to bring in the acquisition and looked to uplist to a higher exchange or proprietary trading market. 

Restructuring one way or another was a definite need for Rushnet Inc and its shareholders to benefit from any change. 

To that end, it was determined by new management that uplisting Rushnet was not a viable or equitable option. 

In an effort to find a solution that would **maximize shareholder benefits, while providing the funding necessary** to acquire the next laboratory Rushnet, Inc 

* later announced plans to **spin off heliosDX.** 

**The shareholders of Rushnet would be issued** 

* **an aggressive dividend,** 
* **conversion rights** 
* **and an opportunity to participate in a special offering.**

In a fortuitous turn of events, the company was able to find funding for the acquisition through private capital. 

At that point, the landscape completely changed due to changing business needs with the signing of a term sheet with a family office to fund the Company's $20,000,000 Reg A. 

After careful consideration, the Company felt that taking a step away from its plans to ensure the funding to secure its future acquisition(s) was and is the right decision. 

**The acquisition(s) targeted by heliosDX are paramount for the Company's long and short-term goals.** 

Rushnet, Inc also believes these acquisitions for heliosDX are important to the shareholders of Rushnet, as it **makes seeking to uplist to a higher exchange or proprietary trading market post-split next summer (2022) even more realistic.** 

This means, upon execution of the 15-month plan..., 

# heliosDX is now a $15,000,000 to $25,000,000 company 

* and, as such, trading on a different exchange can provide a maximum return to the **shareholders of Rushnet via the split off dividend** (and potentially other special considerations).

In that context, RushNet, Inc post-split will become Grandeza Healthcare. Grandeza Healthcare is a young fast-growing company which spun out of heliosDX in 2020. Much like heliosDX, Grandeza Healthcare has experienced a boom in growth the last few years. Management expects and plans more of the same for Grandeza Healthcare. 

Much of this growth is predicated on future acquisitions contemplated by heliosDX and Grandeza Healthcare. Current plans, if fully executed, should see Grandeza exceed $3,000,000 in annual revenue for 2022.

As of today, the current projections show Rushnet, Inc achieving $7,600,000 in consolidated revenue in 2021, with the combination of heliosdx and Grandeza Healthcare. 

The company believes it has delivered on its promised plan to deliver value to Rushnet, Inc. Similarly, the Company intends to address the share structure soon in a manner we feel is best suited for long term sustainability.

**Investor caution/added risk for investors in companies claiming involvement in COVID-19 initiatives -**

On April 8, 2020, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and William Hinman, the Director of the Division of Corporation Finance, issued a joint public statement on the importance of disclosure during the COVID-19 crisis.

The SEC and Self-Regulatory Organizations are targeting public companies that claim to have products, treatment, or other strategies with regard to COVID-19.

The ultimate impact of the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://pr.report/SYv9KV1X) on the Company's operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the [COVID-19 outbreak](https://pr.report/p24dFnEV). 

Additionally, new information may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption, reduced customer traffic and reduced operations. 

Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

We further caution investors that our primary focus and goal is to battle this pandemic for the good of the world. As such, it is possible that we may find it necessary to make disclosures which are consistent with that goal, but which may be averse to the pecuniary interests of the Company and of its shareholders.

**TLDR**:

Recently, the cryptocurrency market has become more and more exciting because of the rapid increase in the number of new participants. In the current situation of extremely low bank interest rates, more and more people with a demand for ""fixed interest rate loans of 10% a year"" will step into this market.

Applications like Outlet, Linus, Dharma, BlockFi, Celsius have developed user interfaces to meet this need, with liquidity coming from centralised liquidity pools or from Compound and Aave. Therefore, users' attention to decentralised fixed-rate products will be even greater.

# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to [Icmagroup](https://www.icmagroup.org/Regulatory-Policy-and-Market-Practice/Secondary-Markets/bond-market-size/), the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.

Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.

These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.

When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds  
This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds  
These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds  
This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds.  
Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

By definition, it is clear that decentralised bond has the same meaning as traditional bond. Some of the differences include the time to maturity, the yield, and the ability to combine to create many different products and serve different purposes."

Recently, the cryptocurrency market has become more and more exciting because of the rapid increase in the number of new participants. In the current situation of extremely low bank interest rates, more and more people with a demand for ""fixed interest rate loans of 10% a year"" will step into this market.

Applications like Outlet, Linus, Dharma, BlockFi, Celsius have developed user interfaces to meet this need, with liquidity coming from centralised liquidity pools or from Compound and Aave. Therefore, users' attention to decentralised fixed-rate products will be even greater.

# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to [Icmagroup](https://www.icmagroup.org/Regulatory-Policy-and-Market-Practice/Secondary-Markets/bond-market-size/), the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.

Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.

These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.

When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds  
This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds  
These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds  
This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds.  
Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).Traditional BondDefinitionA bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.Types of Bonds

* Government bonds This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds. Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

Decentralised BondDefinitionBy definition, it is clear that decentralised bond has the same meaning as traditional bond. Some of the differences include the time to maturity, the yield, and the ability to combine to create many different products and serve different purposes."
"Ludovic Delion : L AAVE, analys√© comme le catalyseur de la finance d√©centralis√©e, une devise revolutionnaire",https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockchain_6/comments/qdv3u1/ludovic_delion_l_aave_analys√©_comme_le_catalyseur/,ludovic-delion,1,2021-10-23 09:34:51,0,/r/Blockchain_6/comments/qdv3u1/ludovic_delion_l_aave_analys√©_comme_le_catalyseur/,NaN,"Aave (AAVE)cryptomonnaie et le protocole de pr√™t de cryptomonnaies non-custodial  
Ainsi D√©couvrir Aave (AAVE),c est comprendre le protocole open source et non-custodial permettant la cr√©ation de march√©s de la finance d√©centralis√©e (DeFi). Il permet √† ses utilisateurs de percevoir des int√©r√™ts sur le d√©p√¥t de leurs cryptomonnaies et d'emprunter des actifs, le tout de mani√®re d√©centralis√©e.  
Cr√©√©e en 2017 et bas√©e √† Londres, la soci√©t√© Aave est √† l'origine du protocole du m√™me nom. Elle d√©veloppe un protocole d√©centralis√© du march√© financier non privatif de libert√© auquel les utilisateurs peuvent participer en tant que pr√™teurs ou emprunteurs.  
Les pr√™teurs fournissent des liquidit√©s au march√© afin de g√©n√©rer un revenu passif, tandis que les emprunteurs peuvent souscrire des emprunts avec des crypto-actifs mis en garantieLe protocole Aave prend en charge plus de 15 crypto-actifs diff√©rents, avec une large s√©lection de stablecoins. Lors d'un d√©p√¥t dans le protocole Aave, des Aave Tokens (aTokens) sont forg√©s.Ces tokens particuliers suivent la valeur de l'actif sous-jacent et sont br√ªl√©s lors du remboursement du pr√™t. Pendant que l'actif sous-jacent est pr√™t√© aux emprunteurs, les aTokens produisent des int√©r√™ts en temps r√©el. De plus, ils peuvent √™tre librement stock√©s, transf√©r√©s et √©chang√©s.Aave propose √©galement des solutions sous-collat√©ralis√©es. Le protocole rend ainsi possibles les emprunts de mani√®re instantan√©e sans qu'une garantie soit n√©cessaire.Par le pass√©, Aave √©tait connue sous le nom d'ETHLend, que la soci√©t√© a rapidement abandonn√© pour marquer son passage d'une strat√©gie de pr√™t P2P d√©centralis√©e √† une strat√©gie bas√©e sur les pools de liquidit√©.  
Auparavant, le token natif du protocole √©tait le LEND, qui a r√©cemment √©t√© remplac√© par le AAVE suite √† une migration accept√©e par la communaut√©. Le ratio de migration √©tait de 100 LEND pour 1 AAVE.  
¬´ Aave ¬ª est un mot finnois qui se traduit par ¬´ fant√¥me ¬ª en fran√ßais. Pour Aave, cela repr√©sente son objectif de cr√©er une infrastructure transparente et ouverte pour une finance hautement d√©centralis√©e.  
Complexe dans son fonctionnement, penchons-nous sur les nombreuses composantes du protocole Aave. Comment celui-ci fonctionne-t-il et que vous permet-il de faire ?  
La tok√©nisation par les Aave Tokens  
Le protocole Aave impl√©mente une strat√©gie de tokenisation pour les fournisseurs de liquidit√©. Lors d'un d√©p√¥t, l'utilisateur re√ßoit une quantit√© correspondante de tokens de produits d√©riv√©s, baptis√©s Aave Tokens (ou aTokens).  
**Ceux-ci correspondent avec un ratio 1:**1 aux actifs sous-jacents d√©pos√©s et suivent le standard ERC 20 d'Ethereum. Le solde des aTokens de chaque d√©posant augmente au fil du temps, en raison de l'accumulation permanente des int√©r√™ts g√©n√©r√©s par les d√©p√¥ts.  
Les aTokens impl√©mentent nativement le concept de r√©orientation des taux d'int√©r√™t. Ce concept permet de distinguer la valeur accumul√©e au fil du temps par les int√©r√™ts pay√©s par les emprunteurs du solde initial.  
D√®s qu'un portefeuille li√© √† Aave comporte de aTokens, la valeur accumul√©e par ces derniers peut √™tre redirig√©e vers n'importe quelle adresse, ce qui permet de fractionner le solde et les int√©r√™ts g√©n√©r√©s.  
Malgr√© les avantages que ce mod√®le de tokenisation pr√©sente, il s'accompagne d'un inconv√©nient non n√©gligeable. Il est impossible de transf√©rer la totalit√© du solde en une seule transaction.  
En effet, le montant exact d'un transfert ne peut pas √™tre renseign√©, puisque les int√©r√™ts continuent √† fonctionner m√™me pendant la confirmation de l'op√©ration de transfert. Cela signifie qu'un tr√®s petit solde (dust balance) sera toujours laiss√© sur le portefeuille √† l'origine d'un transfert.  
D√©poser des cryptomonnaies et g√©n√©rer des revenus avec Aave  
Aave requiert au pr√©alable une connexion √† un portefeuille externe supportant Ethereum. En raison de son efficacit√© et de sa r√©putation dans l'industrie, je vous conseille vivement d'utiliser MetaMask.  
Ce navigateur Web est relativement simple √† utiliser et √† initialiser.  
**Si vous d√©tenez d√©j√† votre propre portefeuille MetaMask et √™tes un habitu√© de son utilisation, passez ce tutoriel. Dans le cas contraire, d√©couvrez les 3 √©tapes pr√©alables avant de pouvoir utiliser Aave avec MetaMask :**  
L'utilisation de cette fonctionnalit√© est tr√®s simple. Il vous suffit de s√©lectionner l'actif que vous souhaitez d√©poser parmi les cryptomonnaies support√©es par la plateforme, puis de renseigner le montant de votre d√©p√¥t. Une fois votre d√©p√¥t enregistr√©, vous commencez √† percevoir des int√©r√™ts.  
Chaque actif a son propre march√© de l'offre et de la demande avec son propre taux d'int√©r√™t annuel qui √©volue avec le temps. Ainsi, si l'√©cart entre les liquidit√©s disponibles et les fonds emprunt√©s se resserre, le taux d'int√©r√™t annuel en d√©p√¥t augmente (ceci est √©galement fonction d'autres facteurs).  
Comment sont calcul√©s les int√©r√™ts per√ßus ?  
Les d√©positaires de tokens sur Aave re√ßoivent des revenus continus qui √©voluent en fonction des conditions du march√© et se divisent en deux parties.  
Le paiement du taux d'int√©r√™t sur les pr√™ts  
Tous ceux apportant de la liquidit√© √† un actif se partagent les int√©r√™ts pay√©s par les emprunteurs correspondant au taux d'emprunt moyen multipli√© par le taux d'utilisation.  
Plus le taux d'utilisation d'une r√©serve est √©lev√©, plus le rendement pour les d√©posants est √©lev√©. Une feuille de calcul mise √† jour en temps r√©el permet de voir ce mod√®le de taux d'int√©r√™t en action.  
Le paiement du taux d'int√©r√™t sur les flash loans  
Les d√©posants re√ßoivent 0,063 % du volume de tout flash loan (pr√™t √©clair) ex√©cut√© sur Aave.  
Emprunter des cryptomonnaies avec Aave  
Pourquoi emprunter des cryptomonnaies ?  
Seconde possibilit√© avec Aave, l'emprunt de cryptomonnaies. Cela peut vous para√Ætre assez curieux, mais emprunter des cryptos peut s'av√©rer relativement int√©ressant.  
Supposons que vous avez une position ouverte sur un actif, prenons l'exemple de l'ETH, et qu'une opportunit√© d'investissement s'offre √† vous. Il vous sera impossible de r√©cup√©rer vos ETH, sauf si vous cl√¥turez votre position.  
En empruntant des cryptomonnaies avec Aave, vous pouvez donc obtenir des liquidit√©s sans pour autant vendre vos actifs. Cela vous permet ainsi de profiter de nouvelles possibilit√©s d'investissement, ou m√™me de faire face √† des d√©penses impr√©vues.  
Comment emprunter des crypto-monnaies avec Aave ?  
Avant tout chose, vous devez d√©poser sur Aave des fonds qui serviront de garantie, aussi appel√©e ¬´ collat√©ral ¬ª. R√©f√©rez-vous √† la partie pr√©c√©dente pour en savoir plus sur ce point.  
Une fois devant la liste des actifs disponibles, s√©lectionnez celui dont vous avez besoin, plus cliquez sur le bouton ¬´ Emprunter ¬ª en bas √† droite.  
Renseignez ensuite le montant souhait√© en fonction de votre collat√©ral. S√©lectionnez ensuite un taux stable ou variable puis confirmez votre transaction. Aave vous permet de modifier le type de taux s√©lectionn√© √† tout moment par la suite.  
Quelle est la diff√©rence entre taux stable et taux variable ?  
Le taux stable  
Les taux stables agissent comme un taux fixe √† court terme, mais peuvent √™tre r√©√©quilibr√©s √† long terme en fonction de l'√©volution des conditions du march√©. Opter pour un taux stable permet donc de planifier √† l'avance le montant des int√©r√™ts √† payer.  
Un r√©√©quilibrage des taux stables est peu probable, mais se produit si le taux d'emprunt moyen est inf√©rieur √† 25% et que le taux d'utilisation est sup√©rieur √† 95%.  
Le Le taux variable est le taux bas√© sur l'offre et la demande dans Aave. Le taux variable changera au fil du temps et est plus avantageux taux variable  
en fonction de la situation.  
V√©ritable moteur de l'√©cosyst√®me Aave, le AAVE joue le r√¥le d'utility token. Il peut notamment √™tre utilis√© pour r√©duire les frais des diff√©rents services d'Aave et donne √©galement des droits sur la gouvernance du protocole.  
AAVE est utilis√© pour voter et d√©cider du r√©sultat des propositions d'am√©lioration d'Aave (AIP). En outre, le AAVE est √©ligible au staking dans le cadre du module de s√©curit√© du protocole. Cela fournit une s√©curit√© aux d√©posants et permet de g√©n√©rer un revenu passif.  
Les tokens AAVE utilis√©s pour payer les frais d'Aave sont automatiquement br√ªl√©s. Ainsi, cela permet de naturellement r√©duire le nombre de tokens en circulation, ce qui de surcro√Æt augmente sa raret√©.  
Le projet Aave a r√©colt√© un total de 24 millions de dollars au cours de 2 cycles de financement, lorsque le token LEND √©tait encore d'actualit√©.  
En novembre 2017, Aave a fait l'objet d'une ICO publique, laquelle lui a permis de r√©colter 16,5 millions de dollars. Notez que lors de cette lev√©e de fonds, le token LEND √©tait propos√© au prix de seulement 0,017270 dollar (ce qui repr√©sente un token AAVE √† 1,7270 dollars).  
Dans un second temps, en juillet 2020, Aave a re√ßu le soutien de plusieurs fonds d'investissement, lui permettant de collecter 7,5 millions de dollars suppl√©mentaires. Le projet a notamment re√ßu le soutien de DTC Capital, Parafi Capital Three Arrow Capital et Framework Ventures.  
√âquipe et partenaires  
L'√©quipe  
**Selon la liste officielle des membres de l'√©quipe d'Aave,celle-ci se compose de 18 personnes. Penchons-nous sur le parcours et les missions de ses principaux membres :**  
Fondateur et PDG d'Aave, Stani Kulechov est un chef d'entreprise chevronn√© qui poss√®de une vaste exp√©rience dans le d√©veloppement de solutions dans le secteur de la blockchain. Dipl√¥m√© d'un Master de droit √† l'universit√© d‚ÄôHelsinki, Stani Kulechov conseille notamment de nombreux projets blockchains et prend souvent la parole lors de conf√©rences au sujet de la FinTech et des smart contracts d'Ethereum.  
√Ä l'avenir, Aave voit grand, et compte bien conqu√©rir toute l'Europe. En effet, depuis ao√ªt 2020, la Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), le gendarme financier du Royaume-Uni, a accord√© √† Aave une licence d'√©tablissement de monnaie √©lectronique. Cette licence autorise la startup √† fournir des services de paiement au m√™me titre que ceux de Coinbase et Revolut.  
AAVE est la 28e crypto-monnaie du classement  
AAVE (AAVE) est un march√© mon√©taire d√©centralis√© qui fonctionne sur la blockchain Ethereum. AAVE permet aux utilisateurs de pr√™ter et d'emprunter une gamme de crypto-actifs. Le site Web d'AAVE le d√©crit comme un ""protocole de liquidit√© non d√©positaire pour gagner des int√©r√™ts sur les d√©p√¥ts et emprunter des actifs.""  
Au 22 juin, la capitalisation boursi√®re d'AAVE se situait au niveau de 2,674 milliards de dollars, la crypto se n√©gociant autour de 214 dollars par jeton.

Au 22 juin, la capitalisation boursi√®re d'AAVE se situait au niveau de 2,674 milliards de dollars, la crypto se n√©gociant autour de 214 dollars par jeton.  
Comme le souligne le graphique, AAVE a atteint un bas d'environ 26,20 $ en novembre 2020 et un haut de 643,07 $ √† la mi-mai 2021, lorsque l'Ethereum a atteint son sommet. La crypto a progress√© plus de vingt-quatre fois et demie entre fin 2020 et le sommet de mai 2021. Au niveau de 214 $ le 22 juin, AAVE √©tait un tiers du prix des sommets, car la crypto a sous-perform√© le Bitcoin et l'Ethereum pendant la correction des prix.  
Amp est num√©ro 29, avec une capitalisation boursi√®re l√©g√®rement sup√©rieure √† celle d'AAVE  
Amp (AMP) est une plateforme permettant de garantir les transferts d'actifs. Le site Web d'Amp indique qu'elle fournit aux actifs en crypto-monnaies ""une assurance instantan√©e et v√©rifiable pour toute application dans le monde r√©el"". AMP dispose de fonctionnalit√©s de contrats intelligents pour les garanties.  
Au 22 juin, AMP √©tait la 29e crypto-monnaie en importance juste derri√®re AAVE, avec une capitalisation boursi√®re de 2,633 milliards de dollars √† 0,06343 $ par jeton. Amp et AAVE ont chang√© de place dans le classement au cours des derniers jours  
Element centrale et Poids lourd de la finance d√©centralis√©e, Aave est un protocole de pr√™t open source de crypto-monnaies g√©r√© √† 100% par ses utilisateurs. Les pr√™teurs per√ßoivent un int√©r√™t sur leur d√©p√¥t, tandis que les emprunteurs ont la possibilit√© d‚Äôacc√©der √† des liquidit√©s en mettant en gage leur crypto-monnaies.  
Cet √©cosyst√®me est sous-tendu par le jeton du m√™me nom, l‚ÄôAAVE. D√©tenir de l‚ÄôAAVE donne la possibilit√© de participer √† la gouvernance du protocole et permet √©galement de r√©duire les frais induits par ce dernier.  
Aave a une offre encore plus limit√©e que le Bitcoin . Aave a migr√© vers Polygon √† partir de la blockchain Ethereum car Polygon r√©sout mieux les probl√®mes de confirmations de lenteur et de frais de gaz √©lev√©s.  
Aave a connu une croissance consid√©rable de son activit√© d‚Äôutilisateurs cette ann√©e et est devenu un √©l√©ment important du mouvement de la finance d√©centralis√©e (DeFi).  
Aave, Sushi, Curve et PoolTogether ont r√©cemment annonc√© une initiative d‚Äôadoption de DeFi de 100 millions de dollars avec une plate-forme mobile pour les applications financi√®res du nom de Celo.  
Ce partenariat vise √† rendre les services DeFi accessibles √† 6 milliards de personnes sur la plan√®te qui poss√®dent un smartphone avec une connexion Internet. Une autre nouvelle positive est que SEBA Bank, une banque suisse agr√©√©e par la FINMA, a annonc√© le mois dernier qu‚Äôelle √©tendait son offre de produits √† DeFi avec un support suppl√©mentaire pour Aave (AAVE) et Chainlink (LINK).  
L‚Äôint√©r√™t des investisseurs pour les actifs num√©riques augmente rapidement et beaucoup veulent aller au-del√† du bitcoin. SEBA Bank offre aux investisseurs un acc√®s personnalis√© aux moteurs de rendement et aux avantages de diversification de cette nouvelle classe d‚Äôactifs ¬ª, a d√©clar√© Alistair Heggie, COO de SEBA Bank.  
Cela ressemble √† premi√®re vue √† l‚Äôannonce d‚Äôune √©ni√®me plateforme d√©centralis√©e concurrente au g√©ant Twitter. Une sorte de fantasme r√©current dans l‚Äôunivers des cryptomonnaies face √† la mise en place de r√©seaux sociaux pr√©sent√©s comme natifs √† ce secteur. Et dont l‚Äôinnovation consiste le plus souvent √† reprendre le contr√¥le de ses donn√©es. Mais √©galement √† les mon√©tiser, parfois selon des principes plus malsains que novateurs. Cependant, √† y regarder de plus pr√®s, cette annonce du protocole Aave cache peut-√™tre une motivation plus‚Ä¶ revancharde.  
Il est difficile de d√©nombrer la quantit√© de projets de l‚Äôunivers des cryptomonnaies qui n‚Äôont pas tent√© leur chance dans la cr√©ation de r√©seaux sociaux. Le tout selon un mod√®le th√©orique associ√© au web3 et √† la d√©centralisation sur une blockchain. Mais √©galement avec une volont√© de reprendre le contr√¥le de ce contenu que les g√©ants actuels du secteur mon√©tisent √† leur avantage. Un mod√®le √©conomique qui a du mal √† s‚Äôimposer et dont les r√©sultats sont aussi d√©cevants que l‚Äôabsence d‚Äôadoption qu‚Äôils provoquent au sein de la communaut√©.  
**Cela en premier lieu car il est toujours difficile de concurrencer les primitives d‚Äôun secteur. Et tout comme le Bitcoin ne sera jamais remplac√© par le Dogecoin, Twitter trouvera difficilement un concurrent √† sa taille. Mais dans une logique d‚Äô√©volution de l‚ÄôInternet actuel vers sa version web3 d√©centralis√©e et communautaire, cette perspective reste n√©anmoins d‚Äôactualit√©. Et les projets qui tentent de surfer sur cette tendance se succ√®dent avec un mod√®le cependant (presque) toujours identique :** mon√©tiser ses donn√©es personnelles pour son propre compte.  
Aave veut d√©velopper un Twitter sur Ethereum  
Et dans cette longue liste de projets concurrents √† Twitter, c‚Äôest aujourd‚Äôhui le fondateur du protocole Aave qui entre dans la course. Cela suite √† une r√©cente d√©claration qui expose sa volont√© de d√©velopper une plateforme de ce type avant la fin de cette ann√©e. Une bien √©trange d√©cision pour un protocole dont l‚Äôactivit√© est principalement centr√©e sur l‚Äôoffre de pr√™ts dans l‚Äôunivers de la DeFi. Et qui fait de ce dernier le plus important de ce secteur avec une valorisation actuelle toute proche des 11 milliards de dollars sur le site DefiPulse. Ce qui le place en t√™te de cet √©cosyst√®me avec une dominance de 17% de parts de ce march√©.  
¬´ Nous pensons que les cr√©ateurs de contenu devraient poss√©der leur public sans autorisation. Un espace o√π tout le monde peut cr√©er de nouvelles exp√©riences utilisateur en utilisant le m√™me graphique social et les m√™mes donn√©es en cha√Æne. ¬ª ‚Äì Stani Kulechov  
Mais ce n‚Äôest pas la premi√®re fois que le projet Aave s‚Äô√©carte quelque peu de son domaine d‚Äôactivit√© principal. Ce qui avait donn√© naissance aux √©tranges NFTs du nom d‚ÄôAavegotchi √† la fin de l‚Äôann√©e derni√®re. Le tout reposant sur un jeton GHST au succ√®s plut√¥t mitig√©  
le protocole DeFi AAVE prend en charge AVAX, Aave est un syst√®me de pools de pr√™ts d√©centralis√©s qui collecte les fonds des utilisateurs et prend en charge les pr√™ts/emprunts via des contrats intelligents.  
Aave Protocol a int√©gr√© Avalanche comme troisi√®me blockchain publique apr√®s Ethereum et Polygon. Cela permet aux traders d arbitrer plus facilement leurs actifs vers Aave pour le pr√™t ou le jalonnement.  
le protocole Aave s'impose comme le catalyseur de la finance d√©centralis√©e . Ce secteur √©mergent est une sous-cat√©gorie de l'industrie crypto et d√©signe des services gr√¢ce auxquels quiconque peut jouer le r√¥le d'une banque. 21 Millions revient sur l'histoire d'Aave, d√©taille simplement ce qu'il propose, son mod√®le √©conomique, sa s√©curit√© et vous explique pourquoi il est il est √† l'avant-garde du futur de la finance

I've been working for a healthcare management company in Texas that has gone through exponential growth since I joined. 

I started as an HR Generalist supporting one medical practice, our corporate company, and about 30 employees.  After about 3 months, we added two large practices and I was promoted to HR Manager.  Fast forward to August 2020 and we have 16 practices in Texas, two practices in Arizona and a home health agency, one practice in Nevada, and more corporate entities, plus two offshore businesses in Pakistan.  I also manage payroll - 35 payrolls per month.  So...a lot.  I'm cross-functional and flex into operations, licensing, credentialing, marketing, etc.

Compared to others in roles at the same level and similar experience (but not comparable workloads), I'm underpaid - by $30-50k  My salary is barely on the bell curve.

So - why am I writing about this?  I was contacted by a recruiter for what is essentially the same position minus payroll with 2 generalists and 2 coordinators.  I told my boss, who I work very closely with about the contact and instead of immediately talking about realigning my compensation with my responsibilities - she told me to do the interview.  So, I had a call with the recruiter.  It was fine - didn't think anything of it.  Then he wants to talk again and walk through my resume - an hour-long phone interview.  I tell my boss - hey, they seem to be interested - can we talk?  We talk about what I want to do, what's the next step in my career, all of those things.  

She asks me to work with her on a plan to formalize my responsibilities that fall outside of my current job.   I'm working on that yesterday evening, and I get an email ""hey could you write a job description for a VP of Finance and let us (COO and CEO) know what the compensation is.""  This is after I have already asked for a raise, more help (I have one coordinator for all of the businesses I support).  The Finance department is overstaffed, overpaid, and ineffective.  Rather than coach or try to manage anyone with deficiencies, they just...do nothing.  So, we have a Controller, Sr. Financial Analyst, Sr. Accountant and Financial Analyst, Staff Accountant, and an AP Coordinator.

To hear that we are adding another role after I've been told we're stretched too thin was devastating.  Especially after I was directed to give raises to other people threatening to walk.

I love my boss, we work well together but right now, it feels like she is not my advocate or that I'm expected to be more patient or accept less because I'm passionate and fulfilled by what I do."

I‚Äôm 44, married, 2 kids 12 and 9.  Live in NJ, both the wife and I work full time.  Combined annual around 265k.

We took on some additional debt to finance the repairs and upgrades, and while we were stretching a bit, on our salaries at the time we calculated it wouldn‚Äôt take long to recover.  Unfortunately, not long after, my job situation changed and what followed were years of uncertainty, salary cuts, no bonuses, essentially a real mess financially.  We ended up in about 130k of debt between credit cards and a construction loan.  

Thankfully, things have normalized job-wise and at the same time a long term investment has finally panned out.  As of today I am debt free, aside from my mortgage which is a low 3% 30 year fixed. 

I have about 300k equity in the house, another 200k in retirement accounts, and a few thousand in two new 529 plans.  

After paying off debt and reinvesting into another opportunity, I have about $100k left in cash, and I‚Äôm honestly stumped on what to do with it.  I‚Äôve been lurking here for awhile and reading all that I can, but now that the time has actually come, I guess I‚Äôm a bit cautious.  I‚Äôm considering DCA a chunk into SPY, another into the kids 529 plans which I started this year.  I do want some cash on hand for emergencies, maybe 15k in a high yield savings.  

I‚Äôm well behind the curve, but happy to be on the right path finally.  If things go to plan, my reinvestment should pay out again in a few years at a much higher multiple, but of course there is no guarantee there.  

Anyway, i just wanted to put myself on the board and introduce myself.  I appreciate everyone here, all opinions welcome.  Thanks."

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

* Can format term papers and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Harvard | Chicago | Vancouver | OSCOLA | IEEE format.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROOF OF MY EXPERTISE IN ACADEMIC WORK:**

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROOF OF MY EXPERTISE IN ACADEMIC WORK:**

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.

* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROOF OF MY EXPERTISE IN ACADEMIC WORK:**

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

* I am very knowledgeable and well-versed in a wide range of educational software to tutor students in including but not limited to: Acellus | ALEKS |APEX Learning | Aplia | Blackboard | Brightspace | Canvas | Cengage | CengageNow | Connect | ConnectMath | Connexus | CPM | D2L | Discord | Edmentum | Eviews | Examity | Excel | Hawkes Learning | Honorlock | Khan Academy | Knewton | LimeSpring | Lumen | Maple | MasteringChemistry | MasteringPhysics | MathXL (XL) | MATLAB | McGraw-Hill | Microsoft Word | Minitab | Moodle | MyAccountingLab | MyEconLab | MyITLab | MyLab | My Lab | MyMathLab | My Math Lab | MyOpenMath | MyPsychLab | MySocLab | MyStatLab | My Stat Lab | NCSS | Open Source Software | Pearson | PERT | PlatoWeb | PowerPoint | Prezi | R | Respondus Lockdown Browser with Webcam | Sapling | SPSS | Stata | StraighterLine | Straighter Line | WebAssign | Web Assign |Webex (Cisco) | WebWork | Wiley | WileyPlus | Wonderlic | Zoom

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.

* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.

* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.

* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

**CONCLUSION:**

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROOF OF MY EXPERTISE IN ACADEMIC WORK:**

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

My availability for the Autumn 2021 / Fall 2021 semester will likely become limited very quickly as I receive more and more academic requests.

* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

* Can format term papers and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Harvard | Chicago | Vancouver | OSCOLA | IEEE format.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROOF OF MY EXPERTISE IN ACADEMIC WORK:**

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

* I am very knowledgeable and well-versed in a wide range of educational software to tutor students in including but not limited to: Acellus | ALEKS |APEX Learning | Aplia | Blackboard | Brightspace | Canvas | Cengage | CengageNow | Connect | ConnectMath | Connexus | CPM | D2L | Discord | Edmentum | Eviews | Examity | Excel | Hawkes Learning | Honorlock | Khan Academy | Knewton | LimeSpring | Lumen | Maple | MasteringChemistry | MasteringPhysics | MathXL (XL) | MATLAB | McGraw-Hill | Microsoft Word | Minitab | Moodle | MyAccountingLab | MyEconLab | MyITLab | MyLab | My Lab | MyMathLab | My Math Lab | MyOpenMath | MyPsychLab | MySocLab | MyStatLab | My Stat Lab | NCSS | Open Source Software | Pearson | PERT | PlatoWeb | PowerPoint | Prezi | R | Respondus Lockdown Browser with Webcam | Sapling | SPSS | Stata | StraighterLine | Straighter Line | WebAssign | Web Assign |Webex (Cisco) | WebWork | Wiley | WileyPlus | Wonderlic | Zoom

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called ‚Äútutors‚Äù who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict ‚Äútext / email only‚Äù policy.
* These ‚Äútext-only‚Äù / ‚Äúemail-only‚Äù tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged ‚ÄúU.S.-based tutors,‚Äù I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you‚Äôre checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I‚ÄôM POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it‚Äôs understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I‚Äôm willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I‚Äôm a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a ‚Äúprofessor style‚Äù voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY ‚ÄúIS THIS A SCAM?‚Äù QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose high school &amp; college students as my ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn‚Äôt choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don‚Äôt deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven‚Äôt had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

* I take my work as a tutor very seriously, and I always aim to do my best to help my students excel in school. I have a solid and sincere passion for academic achievement, and with my help, I am positive that I can help students obtain very high grades with minimal stress and effort.
* Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my services and would like to learn more. I'm available 24/7 via phone call, email, and text. Again, thank you for taking the time to read my Reddit tutoring ad, and I hope to hear from you soon!

The study of statistics is hard, like tracking to the peak of Everest. Yes, no one can deny this fact. Yet, even about 60% of data science aspirant skip their plan to head into the AI and ML from basic data analytics role due to the panic of advanced mathematical complexity. This article will tell you five secluded tips that will ease your learning path for statistics for data science. 

## 1. Realize the contribution of statistical concept in data science

We are living in the womb of statistical development. Every moment of our daily lives is subject to the consequences of statistical estimation. For example, tomorrow, you have a job interview. Will you get the job? The evaluation of the answer to this question is based on complex probability calculations, which itself is a part of statistics. Even whatever we search on the internet, the ultimate results come from statistical evaluation. It may be the top 5 restaurants around you for simple reports like the GDP growth of India.

Now the field of data science is aimed to solve all of our real-life obstacles. Therefore, data science and statistics becomes two integral entity. 

Whatever development in data science has been evaluated, all are standing based on statistical strengths. 

Being overstuffed with mathematical nations, signs, and numbers, most aspirants find statistics a boring and stressful subject. But once you become successful in realizing its daily life application, you are bound to find additional interest in statistics. This is very crucial to making your statistical learning easier. 

## 2. Get familiar with the Randomly used statistical terms

Before you dive into your complex online course session, introduce yourself with the key terms of statistics. Below is a small list of the most widely used statistical terms in the data science discipline. 

‚óè Probability

‚óè Mean, median, and mode

‚óè Normal and Gaussian distributions

‚óè Regression

‚óè Standard deviation

‚óè Bell curve

These are the terms that you will hear for lakhs of time throughout your data science course. So, before you head up to the core **data science course syllabus** of statistics, clear any kind of doubts about the above terms. Doing so will ease your learning path to a\[\[recoable extend. 

## 3. Start streaming interesting online videos on statistics.

You may find it a bit crazy. But you heard right. I am telling you to watch several statistical video courses. I know it's not like learning Python, HTML, or Tableau. Still, to gather self-interest and learn about the practical applications of statistical concepts, video course holds a substantial volume of significance. This will certainly make your learning trajectory simpler. 

At this stage, the best option is that you choose learning videos on 

‚óè Business analytics

‚óè [Simple programming based on linear regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2DPc9BtyFU)

‚óè A comparative video like choosing the best-fit statistical test. 

## 4. Start reading or listening to a few of top rated books on statistics

While it comes to statistics, nothing can be the best reference for books. I know most people are now allergic to reading books, and if you belong to the same group, why not try e-books with a read-a-loud option?

To study the step-by-step derivation of statistical formula, earning in-depth knowledge about conventional statistical concepts like

‚óè Linear algebra

‚óè Coordinate geometry of graphs

‚óè Foundational level formula and concepts of integral and differential calculus 

‚óè Fundamental of matrix and probability, etc.

Nothing can be the best option other than the books. 

\[Read the blog [Top 7 Books Every Data Science Aspirants Should Read in 2021](https://medium.com/learnbay-blogs/top-7-books-every-data-science-aspirants-should-read-in-2021-learnbay-8d9e4f5afd74?source=collection_detail----1e5db2039d61-----0-----------------------) to know about the best books on statistics for data science.\] 

## 5. Self-access your statistical knowledge advancement against your daily life experience

These are the most promising tips for making your statistics learning path interesting and easier. Once you start applying your statistical knowledge to solve your daily-life problem, this harsh subject will become fun for you. For example, you can try to apply statistics to the following.

‚óè Managing a profitable ratio of your earnings and expenditure

‚óè Practice analyzing the statistical aspects of several hot and happening incidents roaming around the internet and newspaper related to sports, finance, etc.

‚óè Raise queries to every remarkable incident to face and try to explore and analyze every possible, probable solution to your queries. 

‚óè Download some necessary statistical tools like [SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/products/spss-statistics), tableau, etc. and use them for analyzing for daily collected data.

Here's my experience so far:

* Searched for staked ETH coins on the supply lists of AAVE, Curve, Compound, and Maker. Did not find anything available.
* Found [this article](https://blog.lido.fi/how-to-a-guide-to-collateralizing-steth-with-arcx/) explaining that I could use stETH from Lido as my collateral to borrow on ArcX. That was a fail because apparently you need a passport that currently has an insane waitlist to use ArcX?
* Tried using C.R.E.A.M Finance and ended up with $300 in wasted gas fees. I staked my ETH --&gt; crETH2 ($100 gas). Turned on the collateral button ($100 gas). The app ([https://app.cream.finance/](https://app.cream.finance/)) showed that while I have supplied my crETH2 as collateral, my borrow allowance is $0? So I hesitantly went to the classic version ([classic.cream.finance](https://classic.cream.finance)) and attempted to borrow stablecoins there. My borrow allowance *was* indeed showing on the classic version, great. I submitted the transaction to borrow 99% of my borrow limit and the transaction was confirmed on the blockchain (another $100 in gas), BUT the stablecoins I borrowed are not in my wallet. And on the app, it shows that my borrow limit never decreased. CREAM's FAQ is bullshit and the community is dead. CREAM sucks. Don't use CREAM. 

If anyone knows of a way to leverage staked eth coins to borrow stablecoins against, please pass on this alpha. I use Terra/Anchor Protocol mostly, which right now seems like an infinitely faster, cheaper, easier option."
Evolutions in Liquidity Sourcing,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/qfynbp/evolutions_in_liquidity_sourcing/,LogrisTheBard,1,2021-10-26 12:32:49,26,/r/ethfinance/comments/qfynbp/evolutions_in_liquidity_sourcing/,Strategy,"Let‚Äôs start with this: why do so many platforms nowadays have Liquidity Mining programs? It wasn‚Äôt always done this way; most of the older tokens such as MKR and LINK have never done this. So why did this catch on? Let‚Äôs consider this from the perspective of a DAO. The basic answer is so many modern Defi applications need liquidity at a certain depth for their platform to function. Manipulating interest rates with emissions attracts liquidity locusts and those locusts serve some purpose. There is something they need liquidity for. Stablecoin protocols such as Alchemix, Synthetix, Liquity, and Abracadabra use liquidity to protect their peg. Expiring derivative platforms such as UMA, and [rate speculation platforms](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/rate-speculation-platforms/) need liquidity for price discovery prior to asset expiry. XToken has CLR pools to grant exit liquidity on staked assets with lock times. The list is endless and growing all the time. Acquiring liquidity at the necessary depth is costly. To add insult to injury, when a DAO incentivizes liquidity they do so with their governance token. This in turn necessitates sourcing even more liquidity in the form of a ‚ÄúPool 2‚Äù farm (e.g. ALCX-ETH). Without this the price would just plummet, the emissions would be worthless, and the system would cease to function. This can more then double the required emissions. It‚Äôs a bit of an uncomfortable Ouroboros situation where emissions of a token are used to incentivize buying and holding the token. In the end, hodlers are paying a heavy inflation tax for the privilege of the liquidity.

A further uncomfortable truth is emissions only draw liquidity as long as they last. You have to keep emitting to retain the liquidity. The locusts are extraordinarily mercenary. I call traditional liquidity mining renting liquidity. This is effective in the short term and expensive in the long term. Usually, when structured as I outlined above the base emissions gradually overwhelm the demand for the governance token and drive down the price of the governance token on a long enough time frame. You have to eventually answer how the protocol is going to pay for the emissions and run a balanced budget. To show price growth under heavy emissions the protocol has to also be aggressively growing at the same time (e.g. SPELL). Case in point compare the price of [DPI](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/defipulse-index) (Defi Pulse Index) against the TVL shown in [Defi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/). TVL goes up and to the right, DPI price‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt. Why is the success of protocols not reflected in their token price? The answer is often liquidity mining.

I measure the effectiveness rented liquidity by how many $‚Äôs of liquidity you draw for $1 of emissions. The effectiveness certainly varies by asset class. Renting stablecoins like for the alUSD generally requires 10-20% APR. That means it takes $1 of emissions to rent $5-$10 of liquidity for a stablecoin pool for a year . Renting ETH has a ratio of about 10-20:1 in its pure form. Renting liquidity for your Pool-2 is usually the most expensive type of liquidity. Many protocols aren‚Äôt even getting 1:1. By the end of one year, they could have just bought the liquidity they rented.

**Protocol Owned Assets**

Recently some DAO‚Äôs such as Alchemix have started doing exactly this using Olympus Pro. You can see Scoopy‚Äôs reasoning in this [tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/scupytrooples/status/1447398430574141445). Olympus DAO [writes](https://olympusdao.medium.com/introducing-olympus-pro-d8db3052fca5):

&gt; Liquidity mining, unsurprisingly, faces the same drawback as PoW mining: it is a perpetual expense with no lasting benefit. Liquidity mining can be equated to renting ‚Äî it may be cheaper than buying at first, but stop paying rent and you no longer have it. As DeFi matures, it is becoming increasingly clear that incentives are not a viable long-term strategy for networks. The goal should always be to bootstrap and accrue long-term defensible value, rather than perpetually pay high interest on mercenary capital.

Basically they are saying Proof of Work is to Proof of Stake as Liquidity Mining is to Bonds. I agree with that much. Where I disagree with them is that it‚Äôs more economical to buy LP‚Äôs via bonds than to buy LP‚Äôs directly. At a basic level, as a bond buyer you shove $1 into the bond contract and you get $1+X dollars worth of governance tokens after some delay. What is the advantage to the protocol of buying $1 of LP for $1+X instead of just buying $1 of LP? They are buying the LPs; they are just adding some conditions on the sale via this bond program. But why pay Olympus DAO a 3.3% fee for the privilege of buying an LP? Clearly this isn‚Äôt more capital efficient than just buying the LP.

What the bonds actually do is add a useful delay which adds risk to buyers. Imagine you are a DAO treasury with a bunch of tokens. Your pool-2 is highly illiquid because you don‚Äôt want to do liquidity mining. So, you set the bond to like a 1 year time and offer a steep discount of something like 50%. For reference, a 50% discount would be equivalent to the 100% APR XTK is having to offer LP‚Äôs for their XTK/ETH pool right now. The difference is that when the bond matures the protocol owns the liquidity as opposed to having rented it. At a minimum, the treasury didn‚Äôt market sell their governance token into a highly illiquid pool when they sold the bond unlike if they had to buy the LP using their governance tokens. In the short term it actually goes the other way; people with ETH had to buy the governance token to mint the LP to buy the bond. In other words it bootstraps more efficiently. Further, the bonds can be streamed out at a variable market rate unlike standard emissions which tend to be a constant rate over time. As a result, the token can maintain its value in the short term while the protocol becomes established and by the time the bill is due there is hopefully a deeper liquidity pool to absorb the bond maturing and hopefully there is revenue to create base demand on the token somehow. Furthermore it changes some game theory dynamics in important ways when hodlers are sure there is price support. This is a win for the DAO if investors are willing to pay for the bonds and risk their capital being locked for the delay.

**Liquidity Direction Rights**

The last option available is a bit more abstract: Liquidity Direction Rights (LDRs). Basically it is the right to decide where liquidity is deployed. As a simplistic example, imagine I was giving away $10k. It‚Äôs a foregone conclusion that I‚Äôm going to donate it somewhere. However, you can bribe me to influence my decision on where it goes. How much is the power to influence that decision worth? If one of the places I am willing to donate it to is also a place you were independently going to donate to then securing my donation is worth up to $10k. Any amount you bribe me for less than that is basically a leveraged donation by you. If you can secure $10k to your cause by bribing me $1 then bribing me is 10,000x more effective than donating yourself.

This might sound insane but this is literally what is going on with Curve. Their DAO has decided on an emission schedule for CRV for LP‚Äôs who stake in a gauge. What they didn‚Äôt do however is lock in the rates per pool. Instead CRV voters vote on which pools get what share of the emissions. Then the DAO explicitly enabled a bribe system to pay CRV voters who vote for a pool you incentivize. In so far as directing CRV emissions attracts liquidity locusts having control over CRV emissions indirectly grants you liquidity direction rights for all assets on the Curve exchange. Locking CRV and voting with it is owning LDRs. Bribing CRV voters is renting LDRs.

Sitting upon this system is Convex. Locking CRV provides multiple benefits which increase the longer your lock is. First, your voting weight is increased. Second, crvLP‚Äôs you lock in gauges receive amplified CRV emissions if your address has more CRV backing it. Convex has engineered a way to decouple these benefits and secure a monotonically growing share of Curve voting power. The Convex platform provides a market-based liquidity to CRV pairing system that gives both CRV holders without assets and asset holders without CRV extra income but the real magic is that they tokenized locked CRV. You see, on the Curve platform no token is returned when you lock CRV. Convex created cvxCRV to change this. cvxCRV decouples the asset value of the underlying CRV from the governance rights it otherwise provides. All the voting power of the cvxCRV goes to CVX voters while cvxCRV retains the asset value of the underlying CRV. This makes CVX a pure LDR token whose value should approach the value of the CRV emissions for the same reason that the 10k donation example above should approach 10k in value in bribes. Yunt capital wrote an excellent [CVX explainer](https://words.yunt.capital/the-cvx-arms-race-340bef514713) if you want to dive deeper.

From a DAO perspective this must sound promising. If they need to incentivize Curve LP‚Äôs anyway and CRV or CVX is undervalued compared to the value of CRV emissions then how much of a multiplier do they get for investing in LDR‚Äôs compared to Liquidity Mining or Bonds? How much CRV issuance do you control with $1 of CVX? What is the multiplier of using your emissions to bribe/rent LRDs compared to paying LPs?

At a baseline 1 CVX currently has the voting power of about 7.5 locked CRV. Over the next year the CRV emissions subject to Convex voting is about 225M CRV. Now about 35% of the voting weight of Curve is owned by Convex. That gives Convex control over about 80M CRV emissions. At current prices the CVX market cap is $840M while those Curve emissions would currently be worth about $400M. That means buying CVX should be about as effective at renting liquidity over a year as half that amount of capital in liquidity mining. Over 2 years, it pays for itself and then you own the LRD forever.

Regarding CRV bribes we have a more direct empirical measure. Here‚Äôs a quote from a recent experiment of Alchemix. From the [Alchemix Discord](https://discord.com/channels/738480789464940634/826152864837140492/898911248593330186) (they recently started Curve bribes).

&gt; for the record, we went from 95m TVL on Saddle to now 48m on Saddle and 265m on Curve, so 300m TVL total

This was for an ETH pool. That 95M on Saddle was sourced using an alETH staking pool that was paying ~10% APR at the time. So Liquidity Mining was allowing them to rent ETH at a 10:1 efficiency. Now they added a 400 ALCX bribe. Bribes are every 2 weeks. So let‚Äôs call that 200M in rented liquidity for a cost of about $150k every 2 weeks ($4M a year). That‚Äôs a 50:1 efficiency. That‚Äôs 5x more liquidity per dollar spent by the DAO compared to Liquidity Mining. It‚Äôs an incredible force multiplier which just means that bribes are currently underpriced by the market. [Here‚Äôs](https://twitter.com/VotiumProtocol/status/1447550501109829633) another example. 9k invested for 22M liquidity. That‚Äôs closer to 100:1. Just **incredible**.

**Tokemak**

The most significant drawback of Convex is just that it only applies to the Curve exchange. Now maybe all Pool 2‚Äôs are destined to migrate to Curve following their TriCrypto model but I have no evidence to speculate that yet. How might DAO‚Äôs get the same efficiency boost that Convex provides for Curve for their Sushiswap and Uniswap Pool 2‚Äôs? Enter Tokemak. I think Tokemak is the least documented/understood of these projects mostly because it‚Äôs newest and literally still undefined in places. Here‚Äôs how they [describe themselves](https://medium.com/tokemak/introducing-tokemak-the-utility-for-sustainable-liquidity-8b99a4757301):

&gt;Tokemak creates sustainable DeFi liquidity and capital efficient markets through a convenient decentralized market making protocol.

&gt; TOKE can be thought of as tokenized liquidity.

Sounds promising. If I was to recast this is a more familiar light Tokemak has invented the ‚ÄòModular DEX‚Äô. This is akin to the recent meme of a modular blockchain. Here are the modules:

* Exchange
* [Market Makers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp)
* [Impermanent Loss Insurance](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/protecting-against-impermanent-loss/)
* Liquidity Incentives

In a traditional exchange capital is mostly owned by market makers and if IL insurance exists at all it is provided as a secondary product through tranching systems. We see attempts at such systems through Saffron finance for example. Just like modular blockchains did to L1‚Äôs, Tokemak challenges many assumptions we take for granted about dex‚Äôs today. Tokemak is agnostic of any particular trading technology. It decouples asset ownership from asset management by explicitly creating a role for market makers and granting them liquidity direction rights (but not ownership) over decentralized liquidity. Unlike traditional tranching systems the first line of defense against IL isn‚Äôt a single concentrated actor but socialized market-wide risk. Lastly, it adds extra liquidity incentives just like Convex has managed to without being exchange specific like CRV or SUSHI.

I learned several useful things from their Gitbook:

1) The system goes to [extreme lengths](https://tokemak.gitbook.io/tokemak/mechanics-and-functionality/guardrails-and-impermanent-loss-mitigation) to cover LP‚Äôs IL. They take from the profit on a particular token first, then socialize the loss from the profit of other coins, then they drain the emission rewards for that reactor, then the staked TOKE of the liquidity directors is sacrificed, and lastly they draw from protocol controlled assets such as the DAO treasury. It‚Äôs extremely robust. They are serious on this point. The result is safer assets which means less incentivization is required. Most one-sided staking pools offer less than half the APR of a pool 2. This implies DAO‚Äôs can spend half as much incentivizing liquidity to join a Tokemak reactor as they would a Pool-2.

2) $1 of TOKE can deploy up to [$1.5 of tokens](https://tokemak.gitbook.io/tokemak/mechanics-and-functionality/deployment-logic) from the reactor, which is paired with another $1.5 from the genesis pool, leading to up to $3 of liquidity per $1 invested. This makes TOKE a LDR token like CVX. It is literally a liquidity amplifier. Just like with CVX, the LDR isn‚Äôt lost but reused in perpetuity. If the system is in profit from trading fees after accounting for IL the liquidity directors (DAO‚Äôs in this case) even get paid. Optimistically the DAO won't need to front *all* the TOKE, this is only a worst case.

3) Deposited assets return a 1:1 tToken. This is useful because it‚Äôs a Defi lego that allows DAO‚Äôs to convert their existing Pool 2 staking pools into one-sided tAsset pools. Combined with point 2, they can directly incentivize assets to deposit to the reactor. Furthermore, TOKE emissions go to tAsset holders and a staking pool is the tAsset holder. This gives LP‚Äôs the choice between farming TOKE and farming the DAO emissions. In the latter case this turns the staking pool into a bond-like system where DAO emissions go to LP‚Äôs but the DAO is building a reserve of TOKE in exchange.

So what does creating a Pool-2 look like from the DAO perspective? Since they already have their governance token they can deposit that directly to the reactor for one half of the eventual LP. They can back this with $1 of TOKE for deployments sake as their stake against IL. Next they can deploy another $1 of TOKE to the ETH genesis pool and vote to send the ETH to their Pool-2. Now with $2 of TOKE, they have deployed $3 of liquidity. Where do they get the TOKE for all of this? Bonds. As long as the bond overhead is not 50% this is more capital efficient than bonds that purchase LP‚Äôs directly.

My conclusion is that Tokemak is a more capital efficient mechanism to source liquidity for DAO‚Äôs, especially for pool 2‚Äôs. If you believe that protocols will source their liquidity in the most capital efficient way they can and you believe my conclusion that Tokemak is more capital efficient for Pool 2‚Äôsthan you can conclude that the future of liquidity sourcing is using LRD‚Äôs. Further, if you believe that the aggregate liquidity depth is going to continue to grow exponentially then these LRD tokens are going to need to grow proportionally to the demand for liquidity.

**Unsolicited Advice**

Lastly, here is my well-intentioned and unsolicited advice to DAO‚Äôs as Defi undergoes this inevitable transformation to sustainably sourcing liquidity.

First. Stop overpaying for liquidity. Stop emitting a flat rate to staking pools. Have an explicit numeric target for your liquidity depth. Actively measure the elasticity of liquidity to incentive and pay only what you need. Adjust your emissions frequently. More emissions draw more liquidity certainly but they also suppress your token price which makes future emissions less effective. A well-reasoned emission structure therefore rents only as much as it needs to for its goals and uses the remaining emissions to grow the protocol in a more sustainable way.

Bribes are currently very underpriced but the market for them is rapidly heating up. In the short term you can join the arms race and get a massive multiplier to direct Liquidity Mining by renting LDRs. In the 2+ year term you will be better off buying CVX. Use that short term liquidity boost to free up emissions to buy LDRs and PCAs. Bonds are an effective way to do this without absolutely tanking your token price in the short term. You can use bonds to buy CVX as easily as Pool 2 LPs.

It won‚Äôt be long until someone adds a bribe layer on top of Tokemak. I‚Äôll call this protocol Concave Finance until it actually arrives. It‚Äôs inevitable though.

The net result of this advice is meeting your liquidity needs in the short term while building sustainable long term value for the protocol. This is good for everyone in the ecosystem.

Oct, 2021, bella@footprint.network

The crypto market industry saw its first cold winter of the year in May, as mainstream cryptocurrency prices plummeted and the industry's Total Value Locked (TVL) fell below $90 billion due to the impact of national policies in several countries. 

Just over three months later, the crypto market once again saw an even tougher policy challenge in September, with several countries stepping in to introduce various regulations. 

To see the month‚Äôs most important data visualized, [see this Footprint dashboard.](https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/9e13bf17-627a-4636-b984-4a701effcf94?this_month=2021-09-30&amp;last_month=2021-08-31&amp;date_range=past6months~&amp;daterange=2021-09-01~2021-09-30#name=September%202021%20%20Report&amp;secret=8B4F8A1F25E15FCB7713A7C35E4D762D)

**BTC and ETH prices remain stable as policies introduced**

The price of BTC and ETH has a strong effect on all tokens except stablecoins.  

From the data in the chart, it can be seen that the introduction of the relevant policies in September did not have the same impact on the prices of BTC and ETH as it did in May (BTC fell from $58,000 to $35,000 and ETH fell from $4,200 to $2,000), with BTC holding above $40,000 and ETH maintained a level above $3,000. The price of the coins did not fluctuate and the overall cryptocurrency market tended to be stable.

**DeFi had a TVL of $182.2 billion at the end of September, up 7.2% from the previous month**

Compared to August, TVL in September was buoyant, topping $190 billion at the beginning of the month, a record high for the year. Although TVL declined slightly in mid and late September to varying degrees, even falling below $170 billion, the extent of the decline and the duration of the effect was far less than the impact of the policy change in May.

The crypto market stayed resilient, with investors avoiding panicking.

**Older blockchains are slow to develop, but new ones are bursting on the scene**

According to data provided by Footprint, the TVL and market share of TVL for Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain in September gradually were reduced by emerging blockchains.

On the other hand, emerging blockchains are gaining momentum. Solana is the main example and ranked 5th in blockchains in August with $3.33 billion TVL and was already 3rd in September with $9.79 billion (this chain had surpassed $12 billion in mid-September). 

Avalanche, which has grown as a result of liquidity mining, is also doing well, ranking 6th on the public chain with $3.68 billion. (Footprint has already analysed a number of emerging blockchains: [What‚Äôs so special about Solana?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SIzJz_NTZIhmXDoaMI0hJ6UUcea0orSSfb7t0tLHztg/edit?userstoinvite#) , [Footprint: The blockchains battle breaking outÔºåAvalanche gaining momentum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zy754XYJOQnXHaNZOiGE2hCSU1mYcUUX4aRmdeiSsY0/edit#heading=h.er52wdbsvto5))

With the introduction of Korea's policy to shut down two-thirds of cryptocurrency exchanges, the development of Terra, which is based in Korea, suffered somewhat in September, dropping it from third to fourth place overall in the blockchain rankings, with its TVL growing by just 14.1%. For comparison, Solana grew by 193.9% and Avalanche by 74.41%.

&amp;#x200B;

**New blockchains show promise as they see rapid growth**

The highest TVL growth rate was recorded by Arbitrum, which is part of Layer2. With lower transaction fees and faster transaction speeds compared to Ethereum, Arbitrum has attracted an influx of funds and project owners (Curve and SushiSwap are now online). With a growth rate of 856,323.64% (TVL from a little over $100,000 to $1.3 billion), it not only came out on top of the growth rate of many blockchains, but also stood out among the many Layer2 projects.

It was followed by OKExChain, which seized the opportunity to develop an infrastructure conducive to the development of GameFi and launched the GameFi Hackathon, attracting many projects to go live on the chain and achieving a growth rate of 3,470.16% in September.

Moonriver came in third with a growth rate of 2,195.26% with $220 million in the same month. It has both the cross-chain advantages of the Polkadot ecosystem and strong compatibility with Layer1, which provides a better experience for developers and users.

**DEX, Lending, Yield continue to dominate DeFi's headlines**

As in August, DEX, lending and yield were the top three DeFi market share categories. DEX occupies the first place with 30.55%, although there was a 0.34% decrease in the share compared to last month. However, with large centralized exchanges like Binance and Huobi affected by restrictive policies in certain countries, more trading volume and funds have flowed into DEXs, thereby increasing the TVL of this category by $3.61 billion.

The lending category, on the other hand, has been affected by the decline in token prices. It  not only reduced the amount of funds involved in the lending business, but also increased the risk of liquidation of the original borrowed funds, so the TVL of the lending category is down compared to August, and although it continues to maintain the second position, its percentage of market share has dropped by 2.63%.

Yield came in third with TVL of $30.34 billion representing 16.65% of the market share and the highest TVL growth of any category with an 18.74% increase compared to the previous month. The most prominent contributors were Convex Finance ($7.93 billion) and Yearn Finance ($4.69 billion).

### Summary

The impact of the government regulations in September on the crypto market was not significant. After significant volatility in May, the crypto market had a certain immunity to the changes in policies and it continued to develop with good resilience and tension. 

Emerging blockchains are gaining momentum, and those that have already stood out are expected to reach new heights next month, while those that have yet to emerge will also sprout one after another. For the old blockchains that are slow in development, as their carrying capacity increases, congestion will become more and more serious and their position will gradually be overtaken by the emerging blockchains.

Setting the Record Straight: Misinformation on the Half-Day Collapse,https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOCPress/comments/qg2fag/setting_the_record_straight_misinformation_on_the/,KalvinLokan,1,2021-10-26 17:12:40,5,/r/MHOCPress/comments/qg2fag/setting_the_record_straight_misinformation_on_the/,Devolved,"In a recent piece discussing the Combined Unionist Alliance, the Viscount Felixstowe repeated the usual nationalist claim surrounding the Half-Day collapse, specifically that the UWP had not been cut out of the budget on account of messaging in the all parties chat not having been much from the UWP. Of course, the Viscount is only discussing this chat, not either the fact that their are internal Executive negotiations, or that this chat was created **after** the Half-Day collapse, citing it as proof that the UWP 'caused' the Half-Day collapse for no reason. Now aside from the fact that we never collapsed the Executive, and the fact that the member was not actually privy to the conversations in the Executive when actual budget discussions came up, and the fact that the member is completely unaware at the Finance Minister's own admission that they had done so, admittedly though with the Finance Minister citing an accident rather than any malignant intent, it is clear therefore that the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, following in the footsteps of both the Social Democratic and Labour Party and Coalition! NI, have decided to engage in yet another campaign of smear and lies against the Ulster Workers' Party.

The member openly admits that they were not privy to Executive chats, and indeed admits they were not and are not an MLA, meaning that in quite literally no way, were they to have any idea of anything that went on in discussions inside of the Executive. That of course doesn't exonerate them of guilt for not mentioning that the all parties chat was created **after** the collapse as that was of course down to either gross incompetence on the part of the Viscount, owing to a complete lack of research or effort in their piece with regards to information on the Half-Day collapse, or down to a political intent to shift the storyline they have, from one where Unionists, with their leader of the largest party having just had a hospital visit and recovering, were completely side-lined as the LPNI made changes without their knowledge and against the PfG, into one where the big-mean Unionists collapsed the Executive because they felt like it.

It's a rather sickening rewrite of history, considering that the Executive as a whole moved on, the Finance Minister herself apologising in private for the fact above as the parties inside reformed the Executive and got about delivering for Northern Ireland. The other parties however, aside for the Ulster Unionist Party, seem hellbent on fighting a battle that never particularly involved them, taking up the sword to try and rewrite a battle which was already long concluded and truthfully reflecting just how deeply far behind these parties are compared to the current curve of Stormont events. With no idea of what has gone on, they have made grandiose attempts to change the narrative, pushing back against reality with all their might in the hopes that something sticks to the Ulster Workers' Party long enough for it to have a measurable polling affect. It is of course therefore ironic that the Alliance Party member would claim that it was the CUA attempting to trick people, citing our referring to ourselves as ""the Alliance"" during our press releases. I can assure the member personally, we will not be referred to as the Alliance come any kind of ballot, and indeed we will ensure to differentiate ourselves from them and their rather poor record of surrendering Executive control to nationalists, we are the Unionist Alliance, two parties who have thrown themselves into Stormont to combat secessionist politics and the political lies of parties. Working the UUP has been an enlightening time, and allowed us to open up the political field to include working with our fellow Unionists at a time where other parties in Stormont, or not as the case may be, are increasingly turning to manipulation of events in order to see themselves gain in polling.

The Viscount is perhaps right in one way however. We have perhaps targeted the SDLP too hard as over the recent days it has become increasingly clear that the records of changing facts to suit the political narrative is not just a tool used by certain SDLP members, but also by those in Alliance and C!NI, reflective of parties, worn out and unable to come up with new ideas, struggling against a party which brought itself up on a message of working across the entirety of Northern Ireland. It's a dying breed which have become increasingly desperate for relevance in a political environment which is getting away from them, and a dying breed which voters have long grown tired of seeing labour over the same old tired points in an effort to regain relevance. Unionists have returned to prominence in the Assembly, and we are here to stay. Unionists will no longer tolerate Other and Nationalists politicians collaborating together to cut them out of the processes of the Assembly. Unionists will no longer be happy to see them throw the Executive into chaos, only to weakly point their fingers elsewhere, blaming anything but their own destructive desire to see Unionists cut from the politics of their own homes.

Politics has moved on, and its time that these parties did that as well."

**Economic news:**

US: State and local governments distributed nearly $2.8 billion in Emergency Rental Assistance program funds in September, up from about $2.6 billion in August and bringing the year-to-date total to $10.3 billion, the U.S. Treasury said on Monday.

The Treasury said about 510,000 American households were helped by the aid to pay rent, utilities and arrears, compared to 459,000 in August

The figures show some acceleration of disbursements as programs administered by states and municipalities gain traction, with over 2 million payments made so far, but the pace is still behind the curve, Biden administration officials said.

Gene Sperling, the White House coordinator for coronavirus aid programs, said the program is on track for 3.5 million rental aid payments for all of 2021, ‚Äúmaking a meaningful difference in preventing the feared surge in evictions, but it is still not good enough.‚Äù

Eurozone: Britain will announce a rise in its minimum wage for those aged 23 and over to 9.50 pounds ($13.06) per hour from 8.91 pounds in the government‚Äôs budget statement on Wednesday, the finance ministry said on Monday.

‚ÄúThis wage boost ensures we‚Äôre making work pay and keeps us on track to meet our target to end low pay by the end of this Parliament,‚Äù finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement ahead of his annual budget presentation on Wednesday.

The increase in the minimum wage is due to take effect in April 2022. Rates for people aged under 23, who are paid a lower minimum wage, are also¬†due to rise, the finance ministry said.

"The cryptocurrency AVAX could rise more than 300% and surpass BNB, Cardano, Solana and Shib to become the third cryptocurrency on the market",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qgyogt/the_cryptocurrency_avax_could_rise_more_than_300/,KainAlvaine666,1,2021-10-27 23:01:11,16,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qgyogt/the_cryptocurrency_avax_could_rise_more_than_300/,üî¥ UNRELIABLE SOURCE,"[original](https://es.cointelegraph.com/news/avax-cryptocurrency-could-rise-more-than-300-and-surpass-bnb-cardano-solana-shib-and-become-the-third-cryptocurrency/am)

 However, while analysts indicate exposures in Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA) and even Shiba Inu (SHIB), to the co-founder of TraderJoe, the anonymous user ""cryptofishx"", the cryptocurrency that has the potential to rise more than 300 % and exceed Cryptoassets like BNB, Solana (SOL), XRP, Polkadot (DOT) and even Tether (USDT) is Avalanche (AVAX).

 According to the trader, the rise in AVAX should bring the cryptocurrency to the top 3 of Coinmarketcap, only behind Bitcoin and Ethereum.

 He notes that the rally will be driven by the latest developments in the AVAX ecosystem.  Currently, he says, the Avalanche network has much greater scalability than Ethereum, and the TVL of the AVAX network has skyrocketed in the last two months and its blockchain currently processes 4,500 transactions per second (TPS) against Ethereum, which offers 13 TPS.

 In addition, the Avalanche network launched its incentive program in mid-August 2021. Since then, the total value locked (equivalent to the market capitalization for DeFi protocols and applications) has increased more than 24 times.

 The analyst also points to Crypto.com's support for the Avalanche contract chain.  Therefore, it offers low fees and almost instant transfers on AVAX, USDC, and ETH.

""Curve Finance and AAVE entered the AVAX ecosystem and brought massive liquidity earlier this year. Of the USD 180 million incentives, 10% was spent on attracting new users to the ecosystem. Phase 1 of the AVAX ecosystem was on attracting new projects and liquidity for the ecosystem. Phase 2 tries to cultivate an ecosystem of developers and projects in the network. The new projects built in the AVAX network are preparing to be launched next year, ""he justified.

Price

 Cointelegraph analyst Rakesh Uopadhyay is also bullish on AVAX and has ranked the cryptoasset one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch this week.

 According to him, AVAX broke and closed above the descending channel on October 21, suggesting that the correction may have ended.  The bulls will now attempt to resume the uptrend.

""A strong bounce off the support will suggest that traders continue to buy lower. The bulls will make one more attempt to resume the bullish move, pushing the price above $ 69.18. If successful, the pair could rally to $ 73.41 and then retesting the all-time high of $ 79.80, ""he said.

However, according to the analyst, if the price breaks below the moving averages, the pair could fall to strong support at $ 51.04. If this level also fails, the next stop could be the channel's support line.

It also points out that the pair could now fall to the 50-day SMA. If this support is violated, the bears will try to push the price back into the triangle. If that happens, it will suggest that the breakout above the triangle was a bullish trap.

""Conversely, if the price rises from the current level or bounces from the downtrend line, this would indicate that the bulls are building toward the downtrend. Buyers will try to push the price above $ 69.18. A breakout and closing above that resistance signals that the bulls are in advantage. The pair could then begin its journey towards the highest point, ""he concludes."

# Editorial ‚Äî Olympus DAO

We watched a twitter drama play out this Monday last. What made this particular drama noteworthy was that it highlighted the importance of having a decentralized protocol.

Decentralization means that when emotions get the better of people ‚Äî the collective interest will prevail.

We have mentioned it before, but building a DAO operation is very, very difficult and our operations team (coordinated by [Dudemyguy](https://twitter.com/dudemyguymanbro)) has, and continues to, put in the work to see it built.

Our DAO is now a well-oiled machine primed to deliver consistently over the coming months and years.

OHM will continue to command a premium because of the potential &amp; results of our DAO.

And our DAO is backed by every Ohmie.

# Olympus Pro ‚Äî Cohort 2 launch

Olympus Pro is expanding at a fast pace. It launched humbly with seven partners at first, and collectively, they have now generated more than $300K in revenue for Olympus. Apparently, the [benefits of POL](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/pro#benefits-of-olympus-pro-for-protocols) have caught on with other protocols ‚Äî the partners for Cohort 2 [were announced](https://olympusdao.medium.com/olympus-pro-introducing-cohort-2-launch-partners-6b64dbe2b18c) on 27 October, including:

* [Synapse Protocol](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/synapse)
* [Thorstarter](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/thorstarter)
* [PoolTogether](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pooltogether)
* [Inverse Finance](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/inverse-finance)
* [BarnBridge](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/barnbridge)

With more than 30K members in the Community Discord, the Olympus team is aware of the pressing need for better communication with the community. An AMA session will be organized in the Discord **on 30 October, 5 PM UTC** to field any questions you may have about Olympus Pro. Be sure to mark your calendar and get ready to learn all about the benefits of Olympus Pro.

# More information on V2 migration

Updates for each stakeholder in the Olympus community who will be affected by the upcoming V2 migration (don‚Äôt panic, there are still several weeks before anyone has to do anything):

**i. Stakers**

For now, you don‚Äôt have to do anything. When the migration is live, the Olympus front-end UI will be updated to allow OHM to migrate to v2 OHM, sOHM to v2 sOHM, and wsOHM to gOHM. As usual, there will be two transactions involved: ‚ÄúApprove‚Äù and ‚ÄúExecute‚Äù.

**ii. Bonders**

For now, you don‚Äôt have to do anything. During the migration, existing bonders will continue to earn bond rewards. However, when liquidity pools are migrated, new LP bonds will only accept V2 OHM. So, if you have existing OHM that you want to bond with, you should consider migrating.

**iii. Treasury**

Funds from the protocol‚Äôs V1 treasury contract will be migrated to the V2 treasury contract.

**iv. Borrowing platforms**

For now, you don‚Äôt have to do anything. In a few weeks when migration goes live ‚Äî borrowing platforms such as [Rari Fuse Pools](https://app.rari.capital/fuse) &amp; [Abracadabra](https://abracadabra.money/) will start to accept gOHM. Existing deposits that use V1 OHM will not be affected ‚Äî we understand there is some work being conducted on a loan migration tool.

**v. LP (liquidity provider) pools**

Existing liquidity will be removed from the LP pools that use V1 OHM to new LP pools using v2 OHM.

# Lower LTV for sOHM on Rari Fuse pools

This information is only relevant for holders who are borrowing against their sOHM in the Rari Fuse Pools ‚Äî [Fraximalist Money Market](https://app.rari.capital/fuse/pool/36) or [Tetranode‚Äôs Locker](https://v2.rari.capital/fuse/pool/6).

**Please consider rebalancing your debt as the LTV (loan-to-value) ratio for sOHM in these pools are expected to be lowered to 50% and 66% respectively by 28 October 2021:**

https://preview.redd.it/za2nqluyd0w71.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45e667f136e9a175ad0975dbdf39f74c5a7b220c

[https://twitter.com/fraxfinance/status/1452478728315957250](https://twitter.com/fraxfinance/status/1452478728315957250)

Why is this important? With a lower LTV, you get a higher liquidation threshold. Consider the following scenario:

**LTV: 76%**

**Borrowed amount: $1000**

**Deposited sOHM: 3**

To calculate the liquidation threshold, simply divide the borrowed amount by the LTV ratio:

Liq. threshold = $1000 / 0.76

= $1315.79

For you to get liquidated, the price of OHM will need to drop below the liquidation price, calculated as follows:Liq. price = Liq. threshold / deposited sOHM

= $1315.79 / 3

= $438.60

Now, consider a second scenario with a lower LTV, say 66%, while keeping the rest of the variables constant:

Liq. threshold = $1000 / 0.66

= $1515.15

Liq. price = $1515.15 / 3

= $505.05

As you can see, **a lower LTV translates to a higher liquidation price**, which means you can get liquidated more easily.

So please, keep your loan amount low ‚Äî you don‚Äôt want to be anywhere close to the LTV ratio ‚Äî and repay your debt if necessary.

# OHM-WETH SLP bond goes live

You may have spotted some new bond offerings in the form of OHM-WETH SLP which rolled out on 27 October. Users can start adding [OHM-WETH liquidity](https://app.sushi.com/add/0x383518188c0c6d7730d91b2c03a03c837814a899/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2) on Sushiswap and trade the LP tokens for discounted OHM on the [Olympus website](https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/bonds/ohm_weth_lp).

In spectacular fashion ‚Äî within 9 hours of launch, the treasury has already amassed about $5M in liquidity. As Olympus starts building up its OHM-WETH liquidity, it is expected that users will incur less slippage when they are trading OHM tokens ‚Äî WETH is the primary pair base token in many DEXes, so it enables more route options for trading between OHM and other tokens.

In the meantime, Zeus muses about the impact of this on Olympus and the whole Ethereum ecosystem:

https://preview.redd.it/0dxvb95rd0w71.png?width=591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a7042aa3c7495ea3027b6ed3b6a053c324b263c

 [https://twitter.com/ohmzeus/status/1453102272725069829](https://twitter.com/ohmzeus/status/1453102272725069829) 

 

We guess only time will tell.

# Scammers are out in full force again

With over 45K Ohmies ‚Äî Olympus seems to be attracting more and more attention from scammers seeking to dupe unsuspecting Ohmies out of their hard earned OHM.

The most recent scam appears to be a fake website that tricks users into giving away their private keys:

https://preview.redd.it/25zlin8pd0w71.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3f7c93c7f374ff507839deb1197e27726a88b99

 Agora would like to remind Ohmies that you should **NEVER share your wallet seed phrases or private keys with anyone.** Always practice good opsec (operational security) when it comes to securing your wallet assets. You can learn more about the topic in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sydh7R0ky3M) posted by our friends over at Alchemist DAO. 

# Klima Updates ‚Äî Bonds launch and negative discount

KlimaDAO launched its first bonds, [BCT/KLIMA](https://analytics-polygon.sushi.com/pairs/0x9803c7ae526049210a1725f7487af26fe2c24614) and [BCT/USDC](https://analytics-polygon.sushi.com/pairs/0x1e67124681b402064cd0abe8ed1b5c79d2e02f64) LP bonds on 20 October and has secured more than 6000 tonne of carbon in its treasury since:

https://preview.redd.it/q789lp5nd0w71.png?width=516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb150d1bd306d73487407a93f6b5e2738770e605

 [https://dapp.klimadao.finance/#/bonds](https://dapp.klimadao.finance/#/bonds) 

Due to the unusually high demand, the first day of the launch saw the bond discount turn negative quickly, meaning users would have to pay more to bond. As many users were unfamiliar with the bonds mechanism, people continued to buy up bonds, causing the discount rate to drop even further.

Please **DO NOT purchase bonds when the bond discount is negative.** Instead, you should purchase KLIMA tokens directly from the market (i.e. Sushiswap on Polygon) or wait for the bond discount to turn positive when the demand cools off.

As an aside, here are some of the useful resources created by the Klimates:

# Proposals ‚Äî Funding of Tokemak Reactor &amp; Liquity whitelisting

We saw a few updates to proposals this week:

**OIP-39**

Following a successful C.o.R.E voting event, Olympus seeks to fund the tOHM Tokemak Reactor with OHM tokens from the DAO.

Rather than incentivizing Ohmies to provide OHM liquidity, the author proposes to use the DAO holding ‚Äî it is anticipated that most Ohmies wouldn‚Äôt want to miss out on the high staking rewards offered by Olympus.

Due to a typo in the proposal, the current Snapshot will be annulled. You don‚Äôt need to vote for this proposal until the amended version is uploaded again.

You can read the full details of OIP-39 on the [Olympus forum](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/216-oip-39-fund-tokemak-tohm-reactor-with-dao-treasury-ohm).

**TAP-5**

The proposal to whitelist Liquity‚Äôs Stability Pool and allow Olympus to stake the LQTY tokens has been approved with more than 99% votes.

As a result, the LUSD stablecoins in the treasury will become a productive asset in the Liquity Stability Pool to farm LQTY tokens and earn any liquidation fees.

# Range Protocol ‚Äî A new surprise from Zeus

Zeus descended from his mountain to unveil an experiment he has been working on.

If you have used Curve or Uniswap to swap between stablecoins, you should be familiar with the underlying mechanism ‚Äî the pool automatically rebalances to ensure the value of both tokens in the pool remain in proportion. The LPs (liquidity providers) charge a fee for each trade to offset any IL (impermanent loss) risk ‚Äî though the risk is minimal as the price of stablecoin experiences less fluctuation.

Zeus asked the question: Is the pricing curve model of these pools redundant? What if we could substitute it with a range model such that irrespective of the token price, users can always trade between stablecoins at a 1:1 ratio, as long as a proportion of each token stays within a certain range?

We are excited about how this might play out in practice. Note that the protocol is still unaudited and experimental, but if you are an advanced user you can start interacting with the contract via [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x66e901b750b6ffdbe2262569089bb61a27a19928#writeContract).

# From the Frontlines ‚Äî with Sherpa DC (3,3)

Each week we check in with DC (3,3) to see what were the most asked questions on Discord. This week‚Äôs questions were:

**1. Why has the APY been going up?**

APY rises a bit when the number of stakers decreases; and it lowers slightly when that number increases. The recent launch of the LUSD-OHM crucible rewards and the Tokemak Reactor means there is less sOHM receiving rewards, and hence a higher APY.

**2. When will Olympus Pro add more partners to its Bonds Marketplace ?**

Well friends, the wait is over. Synapse Protocol, Thorstarter, PoolTogether, Inverse Finance,

and Barnbridge are included in Olympus Pro Cohort 2. Their bonds should be available throughout the week, so keep an eye on the [Bonds Marketplace](https://pro.olympusdao.finance/) if you plan to grab some of their tokens at a discount.

**3. I bought wsOHM on Avalanche or Arbitrum. Where can I stake it to earn rebase rewards ?**

It is earning rewards already ‚Äî while although wsOHM does not rebase ‚Äî it does accrue rebase rewards in the form of an increased sOHM balance when you unwrap it at a later time.

**4. What is the difference between Risk-Free Value (RFV) vs Market Value (MV) ?**

RFV vs MV are different metrics for pricing the backing of OHM.

MV backing uses the market value of LP tokens while in RFV backing, these LP tokens are marked down to a very conservative value, or RFV. You can learn more about the rationale behind this in this [Olympus Medium post](https://olympusdao.medium.com/dai-bonds-a-more-effective-sales-mechanism-c9a57586f1f7).

**5. What is Olympus Playgrounds ?**

[Olympus Playgrounds](https://share.streamlit.io/tachikoma000/olympus_playground/main/Playgrounds_Application/Simulators/app.py) is a place to learn and experiment with numbers regarding your OHM investment. For example, you can compare various bonding strategies to see if they beat the simple hold-and-stake strategy of (3, 3).

Note that this tool is strictly intended for educational purposes only. The simulation results and other information displayed on the website **should not be construed as financial advice**.

# Twitter thread ‚Äî Unbanksy on growth

This week [Unbanksy](https://twitter.com/unbanksyETH) digs into his thesis on growing from something small to something great. What is the secret?

 [https://twitter.com/unbanksyETH/status/1453166228961333254](https://twitter.com/unbanksyETH/status/1453166228961333254) 

https://preview.redd.it/d1i6gy4kd0w71.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58d63be706339c5eb71d91cdf34c78ee3ec7a075

The thread argues that to get past a $500 million market cap a project needs the following:

* Brilliant founders and idea
* Good community culture
* Hard work from the DAO

If you have a brilliant idea, you need the support from the community who can provide solidarity and help you iron out issues on all fronts (e.g. marketing, partner relations). Acting alone is like rolling a boulder up a hill ‚Äî a Sisyphean task. At a certain point, a project might reach a plateau where new innovations are needed to attract more capital.

For us that‚Äôs the DAO- they continue to buidl and innovate through Olympus‚Äô highs and lows ‚Äî think 3,3 Together, Olympus Pro partner expansion, and a host of other new initiatives brewing in the DAO.

More to come!

# Ohmie of the Week ‚Äî Zap

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/trcetw7id0w71.png?width=246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=869f25fa538edc80acc1d14e8aaa79e402a9b283

This week‚Äôs Ohmie of the Week is Zap ‚Äî he is a big brain Ohmie that has a deep understanding of the ins and outs of all the Olympus mechanics ‚Äî the Ohmie the Sherpas go to when stumped in #questions. He is also an active contributor over in the DAO ‚Äî cooking up the goods in data and metrics.

A long time member of the Olympus community and unfailingly kind to his fellow Ohmie ‚Äî we are proud to call him Ohmie of the Week!!

# Numbers at a glance ‚Äî $600 million Treasury, $10 million in LP Fees

As we do each week, we returned to [Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia) to gather up the latest breakdown of the treasury numbers and protocol statistics (you can access it yourself [here](https://dune.xyz/shadow/Olympus-(OHM)) if you crave). Please read on for this week‚Äôs numbers at a glance:

**1. Number of Ohmies: 44,780(+7,852)**

* October 12: 29,707
* October 19: 36,928
* **October 26: 44,780**

Welcome to all the new Ohmies! Keep a lookout for them in the Discord and show them the hospitality of Olympus!

**2. Market Value of Treasury Assets: $619,413,551 429,497,796**

* 7-day change: **+$189,915,755** (+44.2%)
* 30-day change: **+$413,294,236 (**\+200.5%**)**

The Market Value of Treasury Assets shows the current market rate of all of the assets held within the Treasury.

**3. Risk Free Value of Treasury Assets: $123,488,422**

* 7-day change: **+$25,138,243** (+20.4%)
* 30-day change: **+$90,101,533 (**\+154.0%**)**
* RFV Per OHM: **$46.14**
* Based on current circulating supply of 3,245,001

As a reminder, when the supply growth of OHM outpaces the revenue inflow, RFV per OHM will drop ‚Äî this is part of the motivation **behind OIP-18** as covered in the [August 18th edition](https://agoradispatch.medium.com/the-agora-dispatch-olympus-community-weekly-newsletter-wednesday-18-august-2021-e9ade7c6c681) of the newsletter.

**4. Olympus Pro Treasury Holdings: $306,694**

* 7-day change (**$**): **+$134,889**
* 7-day change (**%**): **+78.5%**
* The Olympus Pro Treasury holds the tokens of partner protocols who are utilizing the Olympus Pro platform. The tokens are generated via a 3.3% fee charged for use of the platform.
* While relatively small currently, the mutual benefit received by both Olympus and the partner protocols far exceeds the amount of fees received.

**5. Protocol Revenue:**

* Protocol Revenue (past week): **$113,994,755**
* Week-over-week growth of **+55.2%**
* Month-over-month growth of **+187.5%**
* **Annualized rate (using 7-day MA): $5,944,012,225**

**6. Liquidity Provider Fees**

* Total LP Fees Generated: **$10,939,812**
* **$1,559,471** in fees generated in **one week!**
* Week-over-week growth of **+16.6%**

Via: [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/shadow/Olympus-(OHM))

**Olympus has taken in over $10.93M in LP fees to date**. It is worth noting that these LP fees are collected in both OHM and the stable asset (either DAI or FRAX) at 0.25% per trade on Sushiswap and 0.30% on Uniswap.

**7. Current Runway: 404 days**

At the current reward rate of [0.297%](https://dune.xyz/shadow/Olympus-Policy), Olympus can continue to distribute OHM rewards for **404 days** even if it stops bringing in revenue. That‚Äôs **over a year of runway** and a **+5 day increase** over the past week!

If you need a recap on what runway is, check out [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/xh3b4sd/status/1411704921452318727) from u/xh3b4sd.

**8. Current Index: 26.725 OHM**

Current Index measures your current OHM balance if you had one OHM staked since the first epoch.

The following table compares the difference in your current OHM balance based on your staking date:

https://preview.redd.it/dmyqlk8fd0w71.png?width=617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b257e5d8c058c70cdcda0b85183d9496ebf6683

 

The price of OHM on 15 June was [about $204.28](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/olympus). If you staked one OHM since then, you would have more than quintupled your stack now to 5.809 OHM! OHM‚Äôs price today is around $1,131.57. Let‚Äôs find out what is your ROI:

* Principal: $204.28
* Return on 26 October: 5.809 \* $1131.57 = $6573.29
* Principal gain = $6573.29 ‚Äî $204.28 = $6369.01
* ROI = ($6369.01 / $204.28)\*100% = 3117.784%

Investing in OHM back in the middle of June would give you about 31x return today. Don‚Äôt underestimate the [power of compounding](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/basics/basics#what-is-apy).

**9. Macro numbers from around the cryptoverse:**

# State of the DAO ‚Äî Weekly update

We highlight some of the updates that happened in the DAO over the past week:

**Community and Content**

Do you know we have a YouTube channel called [Olympus Agora](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr34Uxn8LwJUEJVBYBGzmog)? We upload recordings for some of our products such as Agora Podcast and Agora TV regularly to target YouTube audiences. Recently, one of our new contributors took the initiative to produce an audio visualizer for our [Podcast episode with Girth Brooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIbz8Whjf2g). We think it is cool and want to give a shout-out to donmijoo for his effort.

Also, the glOHMal team has created a new [Medium publication](https://olympus-cohmmunity-fr.medium.com/) dedicated to French Ohmies. We heard another Medium publication is in the works too, this time offering French translation for just the Agora Dispatch newsletter. As Olympus extends its reach to other countries, expect more of these translation efforts in the future.

**Marketing and Design**

As we anticipate the launch of more Cohort 2 partners this week, the Marketing team has all hands on desk as they need to confirm all the launch details and ensure the accuracy of tweet copy.

**Operations**

tip.cc has always been the go-to choice for OlympusDAO to distribute payout to contributors. The gasless tipping feature is cool, but it has its fair share of problems too: delay in fund deposit and inability to locate certain Discord members are some of them. The Operations team has been setting up [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) as a new way to allocate payout to team members. Barring a few contributors who have yet to sign up for the tool, the team is ready to test out Coordinape some time soon.

**Engineering**

Though all the deployed contracts in Olympus have gone through audits, it doesn‚Äôt mean the protocol is exploit-proof. The Solidity engineers are well aware of the hidden danger present in the blockchain space, and no amount of safety is safe. Consequently, they have been writing unit tests to make sure the contracts are behaving as intended, such as [this test which covers the staking contract](https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/pull/43).

**Policy**

During the market downturn last week, the Policy team adjusted the bond capacities to take in more OHM-DAI and OHM-LUSD bonds. This allowed the pools to support larger trade sizes with little price impact.

The members also drafted two proposals to introduce new bond types: WBTC bonds and OHM-WETH bonds. Both proposals were posted on Snapshot subsequently with the majority voting in favor for both.

**Partnership**

In anticipation of Cohort 2 launch, the Partnership team has been getting in touch with the partners involved to schedule launch time and get all the necessary information (e.g. multisig address, emission rate). Not only that, they had to manage the internal logistics within the DAO so that each team is aware of their responsibilities and be able to coordinate with each other.

# Agora‚Äôs Learning ancient-Greek mythology series ‚Äî Hercules pt. 4: The Twelve Labours (Labours 10‚Äì12) &amp; Later Life

***Preface:*** *This is a continuation of the story of Hercules following last week‚Äôs coverage of Labours 5‚Äì9. If you missed it, you can find it in the* ***October 19th edition*** *of the Agora Dispatch*[ ***HERE***](https://agoradispatch.medium.com/the-agora-dispatch-olympus-community-weekly-newsletter-wednesday-20-october-2021-f6fcbbf5d310) *(near the bottom of the document).*

***Tenth Labour: Steal the cattle of the monster Geryon***

*Hercules‚Äô tenth labour was to take the cattle of the 3-headed giant Geryon and return them to Eurystheus. To reach Erytheia (where Geryon resided), Hercules had to cross the large, sprawling Libyan desert. Frustrated and impatient, Hercules got so angry at the heat of the desert that he shot an arrow towards the sun. Helios, the Sun God, was surprisingly impressed with Hercules and gave him a golden cup with which he was able to sail across the sea and reach his destination.*

*Hercules then arrived in Erytheia, where his first opponent was Orthus, Geryon‚Äôs two-headed dog. A single blow with his deadly club was enough to kill the dog. When Geryon heard what happened, he swiftly took his three shields, three spears and three helmets and went after Hercules. However, Hercules, having smeared the blood of the Lernaean Hydra on the tips of his arrows, shot an arrow against the giant and killed him by piercing through his skull. Hercules secured the cattle and returned to Eurystheus.*

***Eleventh Labour: Steal the Hesperidean Apples***

*The eleventh Labour was one that Eurystheus believed was truly impossible to complete, even for Hercules: steal 3 Golden Apples from the garden of the Hesperides. The Hesperides were nymphs who protected the garden and were disciples of Hera, giving the garden a divine protection. When Hercules arrived at the garden, he encountered Atlas holding up the heavens on his shoulders. Hercules persuaded Atlas to get the three golden Apples for him by offering to hold up the heavens in his place for a little while. Atlas was able to retrieve the apples successfully as he was a relative of the Hesperides.*

*When Atlas returned, he decided that he did not want to take the heavens back, and instead offered to deliver the apples to Eurystheus himself, but Hercules tricked him by agreeing to remain in place of Atlas on the condition that Atlas relieve him temporarily while Hercules adjusted his cloak. Atlas agreed, but Hercules reneged and walked away with the apples.*

***Twelfth Labour: Capture Cerberus, Guardian of the Underworld***

*The last ‚Äî and, thus, most difficult ‚Äî of the Twelve Labours of Hercules was bringing Cerberus up from the Underworld. Cerberus was the massive, three-headed dog guardian of the underworld owned by Hades. Hercules was granted access to the underworld by the gods and was able to convince Hades to let him battle Cerberus. Hades allowed it, but only on the condition that Hercules managed to do it without using any weapon.*

*Even though he was bitten by Cerberus‚Äô serpent-tail, Hercules managed to put the dog in a stranglehold and persevere long enough until Cerberus finally passed out. After this, Hercules chained and dragged the hound to Eurystheus, who was so horrified by the sight of the beast that he instantly hid in his great jar (as he did with the Cretan Bull). From the safety of his jar, Eurystheus begged Hercules to take Cerberus back to the underworld and promised that he would not have to complete any additional labours.*

***Other Exploits***

*Even after completing the twelve labours (which granted him immortality), Hercules did not rest and continued to purge the world of evil. Although it is nearly impossible to list all of Hercules‚Äô exploits in a short summation of his story, we can highlight several of the most notable:*

***Killing Prometheus‚Äô Eagle***

*On his journey to steal the Hesperidean Apples, Hercules stumbled upon the chained Prometheus (whose story we covered in a previous edition of the Dispatch). Having a common love for mortals, Hercules killed the Eagle that tortured Prometheus and freed him from his prison.*

***Freeing Theseus from Hades***

*During his twelfth labour in the Underworld, Hercules came across Theseus and Pirithous, who had both been eternally trapped in the Underworld while trying to rescue Persephone (also covered in a previous edition of the Dispatch). While Hercules managed to save Theseus, Pirithous was left behind as Hades would not allow him to return to the mortal plane.*

***Fighting Apollo***

*Finally, after killing his former Archery teacher Iphitus for not letting him marry his daughter, Hercules was afflicted with a terrible disease and sought out the Oracle of Delphi once again to get some advice on what to do. When he received no answer, he grabbed the tripod of the Oracle and would have broken it if Apollo hadn‚Äôt intervened; a fight broke out between the two and Zeus had to throw a thunderbolt from the top of Mount Olympus to break them up.*"

Defi Lending Protocol on BSC

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, World!

We would like to introduce you to Ploutoz Finance (PTZ), a newly developed Defi Lending Protocol that operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). We currently have $1.47M Total Value Locked and $340,000 marketcap as of 18 Oct 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

Who are we?

We are a professional Defi Team comprised of individuals from various backgrounds, such as an IT Entrepreneur, a Software Engineer, a Management Consultant, and so on.

Despite the fact that the majority of our project members live in Bangkok, Thailand, we all have extensive experience working with multinational corporations, both locally and internationally.

We've accepted our team leader's invitation to join PTZ in this exciting adventure!

&amp;#x200B;

What is PTZ?

Ploutoz Finance is an automated money market platform that provides 100% decentralized finance-based lending services in Binance Smart Chain. Ploutoz enables users to utilize their cryptocurrencies as a lender, supplying collateral to the network by pledging over-collateralized assets to support the borrower. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Lender may receive the following benefits.

1) Interest Amount

2) Rewarded governance token (Ploutoz Token: PTZ)

Here is the contract address of PTZ

0x437dbc6ade5c2aed52bf5ccb54bf1b87a53cc436

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, the borrower needs to pay interest on the debt. The interest rates are set by the protocol in a curve yield, automatically based on the demand of a specific market.

&amp;#x200B;

The Ploutoz Protocol is governed by the Ploutoz Token (PTZ), which is designed to be a ‚Äúfair launch‚Äù cryptocurrency. The PTZ can be earned by providing liquidity to the protocol. 

&amp;#x200B;

The details of PTZ‚Äôs distribution will be as follows.

&amp;#x200B;

¬∑ 30% to Developer Fund

An initial 30% of the total supply of 100,000,000 (30,000,000 PTZ) is reserved as Developer Fund which shall be locked for 2 Years.

&amp;#x200B;

¬∑ 6% to Warchest

An initial 6% of the total supply of 100,000,000 (6,000,000 PTZ) is reserved as Warchest Fund which may be used to manage the project such as building the team, creating a marketing campaign, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

 ¬∑ 64% to Fair Launch Distribution

64% of the total supply of 100,000,000 (64,000,000 PTZ) will be distributed as rewarded from  Ploutoz Protocol to participating users.

&amp;#x200B;

Why PTZ?

BSC has many lending platforms, but we want to create a new and unique lending platform that includes the following key features:

\-Response quickly to new potential tokens

\-Include real-world benefits and profit sharing for governance token holders.

\-Develop a real-world use case for the governance token.

\-Involve other premium functions/features that are only available to governance token holders.

&amp;#x200B;

What are we doing now?

According to our roadmap, we intend to add the aforementioned functions as well as a plethora of use cases to our protocol. The details of our roadmap 2021-2022 will be revealed in stages beginning this October.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the beginning of our company, the value of our protocol has been increasing steadily and stabilizing. Now we have a strong Thailand-based community with over 1,600 active users, so we are confident in our potential and community support. Nonetheless, it has come to our attention that we have not yet created a sufficient reach to global users. As a result, we'd like to introduce our project to you at this early stage, when there are plenty of opportunities to be had.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some of our marketing roadshow events scheduled for October 2021.

We will engage our community and broaden our service offerings in order to reach global users.

Defi Lending Protocol on BSC

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, World!

We would like to introduce you to Ploutoz Finance (PTZ), a newly developed Defi Lending Protocol that operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). We currently have $1.47M Total Value Locked and $340,000 marketcap as of 18 Oct 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

Who are we?

We are a professional Defi Team comprised of individuals from various backgrounds, such as an IT Entrepreneur, a Software Engineer, a Management Consultant, and so on.

Despite the fact that the majority of our project members live in Bangkok, Thailand, we all have extensive experience working with multinational corporations, both locally and internationally.

We've accepted our team leader's invitation to join PTZ in this exciting adventure!

&amp;#x200B;

What is PTZ?

Ploutoz Finance is an automated money market platform that provides 100% decentralized finance-based lending services in Binance Smart Chain. Ploutoz enables users to utilize their cryptocurrencies as a lender, supplying collateral to the network by pledging over-collateralized assets to support the borrower. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Lender may receive the following benefits.

1) Interest Amount

2) Rewarded governance token (Ploutoz Token: PTZ)

Here is the contract address of PTZ

0x437dbc6ade5c2aed52bf5ccb54bf1b87a53cc436

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, the borrower needs to pay interest on the debt. The interest rates are set by the protocol in a curve yield, automatically based on the demand of a specific market.

&amp;#x200B;

The Ploutoz Protocol is governed by the Ploutoz Token (PTZ), which is designed to be a ‚Äúfair launch‚Äù cryptocurrency. The PTZ can be earned by providing liquidity to the protocol. 

&amp;#x200B;

The details of PTZ‚Äôs distribution will be as follows.

&amp;#x200B;

¬∑ 30% to Developer Fund

An initial 30% of the total supply of 100,000,000 (30,000,000 PTZ) is reserved as Developer Fund which shall be locked for 2 Years.

&amp;#x200B;

¬∑ 6% to Warchest

An initial 6% of the total supply of 100,000,000 (6,000,000 PTZ) is reserved as Warchest Fund which may be used to manage the project such as building the team, creating a marketing campaign, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

 ¬∑ 64% to Fair Launch Distribution

64% of the total supply of 100,000,000 (64,000,000 PTZ) will be distributed as rewarded from  Ploutoz Protocol to participating users.

&amp;#x200B;

Why PTZ?

BSC has many lending platforms, but we want to create a new and unique lending platform that includes the following key features:

\-Response quickly to new potential tokens

\-Include real-world benefits and profit sharing for governance token holders.

\-Develop a real-world use case for the governance token.

\-Involve other premium functions/features that are only available to governance token holders.

&amp;#x200B;

What are we doing now?

According to our roadmap, we intend to add the aforementioned functions as well as a plethora of use cases to our protocol. The details of our roadmap 2021-2022 will be revealed in stages beginning this October.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the beginning of our company, the value of our protocol has been increasing steadily and stabilizing. Now we have a strong Thailand-based community with over 1,600 active users, so we are confident in our potential and community support. Nonetheless, it has come to our attention that we have not yet created a sufficient reach to global users. As a result, we'd like to introduce our project to you at this early stage, when there are plenty of opportunities to be had.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some of our marketing roadshow events scheduled for October 2021.

We will engage our community and broaden our service offerings in order to reach global users.

18 months into GE FMP and I'm questioning this career path...,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/qhsidr/18_months_into_ge_fmp_and_im_questioning_this/,Grail_Police,1,2021-10-29 01:50:26,0,/r/FinancialCareers/comments/qhsidr/18_months_into_ge_fmp_and_im_questioning_this/,NaN,"Based outside the US. My salary relative to alternative FLDP's in my region is quite generous.

When we learned about different career paths in high school, finance seemed to be a nice blend of working with numbers and people (two things I thought I enjoy) - so I pursued the path ever since. I ensured my studies, college, degree etc. moulded me into a suitable applicant for finance positions and ended up in the FMP.

I hit the 18 month mark (meaning I've worked 3 different jobs and am currently in my 4th and final one) and I'm second guessing things.

I really enjoy meeting new people, learning from them and building relationships/networks. I also enjoy process/project work that has a focus on operations.

I really don't think I enjoy staring at excel all day. I have to constantly remind myself of the ""why"" behind the work because X amount in cell C97 could represent 3 million or 3 dildo's for all I care. I'm so distanced from the front office, the customer, the manufacturing plant, the actual operations that I don't see the impact of the work I do. It'd be a lot easier to see the impact of your work when you're building or maintaining a turbine vs performing variance analysis.

In the FMP, we're basically overworked too. None of the teams across my different rotations had sufficient manpower. The amount of hoops my managers have to run through to try to hire someone is incredible. As FMP's we have several different commitments and obligations above our day to day job that throw work life balance into disarray, but it's all pooled under the FMP ""experience"" and it's the norm. I‚Äôm close friends with a girl in the US and our experiences are consistent across our FMP colleagues.

I don't think I'm a good performer and I don't think I care much anymore either. I can't tell if it's because the FMP is so demanding and the learning curve/ramp-up is accelerated vs a ""normal"" job, or if my skillset/personality just isn't suited for the finance field. If anything, the experience has shown me I'm not the girl with a chip on her shoulder to climb the corporate ladder as fast as possible.

The trouble is, I'm quite lost now. Finance pays well but what's the point if it does indeed destroy my soul? On the other hand, I've brainwashed myself into thinking Finance is the only path for me, so I have zero idea what I could be good at outside of it. My aim was to get relevant qualifications and try to develop through low stress jobs, but my experience of finance has been the opposite so far."

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to think. You just have to do what I ask for‚Äù.. a Sparkies Tale,https://www.reddit.com/r/OlderSparky/comments/qidxkm/you_dont_have_to_think_you_just_have_to_do_what_i/,OlderSparky,1,2021-10-29 22:21:49,38,/r/OlderSparky/comments/qidxkm/you_dont_have_to_think_you_just_have_to_do_what_i/,NaN,"Hiyas,
I‚Äôve been thinking about why I‚Äôm in a generally better mood, despite my body, and skeleton in particular, being a dickhead.    
I have two new apprentices, 20 and 21, who are amazing. Sponges! They are sponges for information and training, and put concepts together, and come up with ideas!    
I‚Äôm very happy with them. I tell them how well they‚Äôre doing, and I wanted to tell you too.    
It occurs to me that the key to happiness is a good apprentice. You really should look into getting a few. Amazing.

I do hope that everyone here, and the ones you care about are doing OK. It‚Äôs such a time of extra turmoil and discordance around the globe.    
So I bring you a tale and hope you get a smile out of it. Even if you‚Äôre a bot.

Cheers.

This is another tale from the Hospital in a rural Australian town I used to live in. Same Hospital as ‚Äòthe Cupcake Thief‚Äô.    
I have quite a few stories from this town, and this Hospital in particular. 

As an electrician who had a few decades of experience in different fields, I came to this town able to pretty much do anything required. Technical skills and a high quality of work, while being cheeky and personable, pretty much let me get away with a lot of shenanigans. I also fixed the General Managers home treadmill early on, so there‚Äôs also an element of knowing who to keep happy.

The electrical contractor I came to work with was the largest in the region, did good work for fair prices, and had the big Govt contracts for a lot of infrastructure. I added experience in the more technical and specialist side of the business, so the owner didn‚Äôt get too cranky when the times came to slap my wrist.

I relish any opportunities the Universe provides to help people get their Comeuppance Tickets stamped, and am keen as mustard^* for scadenfreude.    
With that, let me tell you about a bloke who voluntarily brought me much joy.

‚Äî-

**‚ÄùMatt‚Äù**    
A standard issue Govt efficiency drive brought Matt to the Hospital in the role of Safety, Security and Compliance Manager. It was a smallish regional Hospital, ~120beds, in a smallish rural Australian town. Until Matt came, these jobs were done by other Managers or Executives as part of other duties. Being a newly created role, it was an absolutely perfect one for someone to come in and be a star.

Most people I‚Äôve seen go into new roles/jobs over the decades, they take some time to get the lay of the land. Get a feel for the politics. The interpersonal relationships. Become familiar with what their job is. Kinda like a sane, professional, reasonable approach.    
Matt‚Äôs approach was like some guy going into a restaurant with an industrial fan and a bucket of shit. Then getting all huffy when everyone is angry and covered in shit.

Now, to be fair, Matt wasn‚Äôt a wanker. He was a proper tool though. And he wasn‚Äôt an idiot, but his ego could make him seem like one.

He came from the Dept of Education in a similar but supervisory role. This was his first Manager gig. Maybe he thought you dealt with Hospitals, Doctors and Nurses the same as you did School Districts and Teachers? It didn‚Äôt take long before Matt was politely told that his unsolicited attempts to change clinical (medical) protocols wouldn‚Äôt be required. *(Without consulting anyone, he tried to change the way nursing staff handled Scheduled Drugs^*. I was told that the 13yr veteran Director of Nursing didn‚Äôt phrase the message this way. But I can‚Äôt write down what she said.)*

‚Äî-

**Matt and I**    
From the get-go, I don‚Äôt think Matt liked me very much. Every time he tried to make changes that involved anything technical, he was told to check with me to see if it could be done or how much it‚Äôd cost. Changes/additions/repurposing to Door access, CCTV, Nurse Call, Security/Duress systems, Matt was directed to me quite a bit. He used to get so annoyed when I told him ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, or ‚ÄúYes, but you better check with Finance to see if there‚Äôs money for it.‚Äù I‚Äôm sure he saw me as a stop sign on his road to glory.

Hand on heart, I tried. In the early days, I tried to get along. Even gave him my direct email and mobile number so he could ask questions, because I knew it was a steep learning curve. I tried, right until he purposefully took some information I gave him out of context, presented it at a planning meeting, and tried throwing me under a bus. 

The little switch inside my head labelled ‚ÄòMatt‚Äô flicked from ‚ÄòOff‚Äô to ‚ÄòFair Game‚Äô.

‚Äî-

**Fair Game**    
About 12 weeks later I received an email from the Hospitals Maintenance Manager asking me to see Matt. He wanted access to all the Hospital systems.    
*(All the systems I managed were stand-alone. Meaning they weren‚Äôt on any Govt IT network, they were completely separate, and I was the administrator. I kept everything running and the Hospital Executives were happy to let me just do my thing. With very little oversight. There was only one department I didn‚Äôt have unfettered access to. Where all the cool stuff was locked in a safe.)*

Speaking with Matt, he wanted to ‚ÄúKnow everything that went on in the property.‚Äù It was a nice 20 minute conversation that I remember well, but will paraphrase..    
**Matt** - ‚ÄúI need to know everything that goes on here.‚Äù    
**Me** - ‚ÄúWell, *everything* is pretty big and a bit vague. Are there..‚Äù    
**Matt* - (annoyed) ‚ÄúI want to know, in detail, what goes on across the campus. It‚Äôs not hard to understand.‚Äù    
**Me** - (not showing that I‚Äôm happy Matt is annoyed) ‚ÄúI think maybe going through a list of systems and figuring out which..‚Äù    
**Matt** - (smug) ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the good thing about this relationship. You don‚Äôt have to think. You just have to do what I ask for.‚Äù    
**Me** - (outwardly stoic, but inside I was a Happy Little Vegemite^* ) ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll get on it then.‚Äù

There‚Äôs nothing quite like sitting on a veranda at dusk after work, sipping Jacks with Nic Cave softly playing in the background, mindlessly watching the wallabies. Just sitting and most definitely not thinking. About Matt, all the communications gear I had access to, and all the systems and plant in a Hospital campus. And his phone.. that, being a salaried Manager, he couldn‚Äôt turn off.

‚Äî-

At some point the following day, while brainlessly programming some electronical gear, my ‚Äúfuckery filter‚Äù kicked in. I went and saw my mate, the regional Govt IT Manager. We had an excellent relationship, so when I asked ‚Äúhypothetically‚Äù *(Btw, you have to double-hand finger the word when you ask questions hypothetically.)* just how many emails a Govt staff could receive in a day, they wanted to know what I was up to. After a brief chat, a nod and a wink, I left with some upper limits.

Unrelatedly, Matt‚Äôs inbox somehow turned out to be a smidgen larger than other people‚Äôs for a while.

‚Äî-

**‚ÄùSorry to bother you Matt. I‚Äôm still unsure what exactly you‚Äôre after. If you‚Äôd like to know everything that happens, for clarity and transparency in moving forward, we have options to facilitate the merging of communications to effectively bring positive outcomes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù**    
*(What was I thinking! Putting as many buzzword bingo phrases as I could in the pre-amble.)*

It‚Äôs very rare that I engage in shenanigans without written CYA. *(Cover Your Ass. A verbal CYA is nice, but a written CYA is golden. A written CYA, worded to give you the protection of a Spartan Phalanx, is to me, a double-dog-dare.)*

The email I sent Matt, asking clarification of ‚Äúeverything‚Äù, was 7 pages long. It went into some detail regarding all the different things he could be made aware of, and how. It had bolded categories, italicised sub-headings, bullet points, and very many words. All I asked was for him to choose what he wanted.

For example. He could know when any of the 500+ doors were opened. Or when any of the damper motors in the air conditioning system opened/closed. Or when any of the 150+ CCTV cameras picked up motion. Or constantly know what temperature the boilers were at. Or when any patient pressed a nurse call button. Or the condition status of the medical gas supply. Etc, etc..    
It was a lovely email. Took a whole evening on the veranda just unthinkingly hitting the keyboard.

I don‚Äôt think he got past the pre-amble, because his reply was just, ‚ÄúYes. ASAP.‚Äù

‚Äî-

**‚ÄùCan‚Äôt stop the signal, Mal. Everything goes somewhere, and I go everywhere.‚Äù**
It was a Tuesday that I was at his office to install his very own 13 character IP Nurse Call Display, with chime speaker. And the CCTV Client PC/monitor, which also had a security/door access client on it. He was very chuffed. He mentioned out loud to himself that no other Manager had these in *their* office. *They* only had the pagers and phones. Like a braindead zombie, I showed him how to use his new toys. *(He did get a bit sad when I wouldn‚Äôt give him admin rights. To be honest, looking back, I wouldn‚Äôt have given myself full admin rights. Because, shenanigans.)*

An IP Nurse Call System, and a Building Management System, when interfaced with an enterprise level security/door access system has a lot of functionality. If you wanted to, you could single out one Nurse Call display and send it *everything*. Same with mobile phone text messages. And email. The possibilities are joyous.

At 6pm that Tuesday, sitting on my veranda, I vacantly looked at my laptop and hit ‚ÄúApply changes and Save‚Äù.    
15 minutes later, like a simpleton, I ignored Matt‚Äôs first phone call. He ended up leaving 12 voicemails. Each one shorter than the last, and each one increasing in vitriol. He really shouldn‚Äôt have sworn so much though, in recorded voicemails.

The Maintenance Manager called at about 7pm, saying he‚Äôd had an angry Matt call him, demanding cessation. After a friendly chat, he was okay with me looking into the ‚Äúweird and unexpected‚Äù behaviour of the reporting systems in the morning. He was also sick of Matt‚Äôs shit.

‚Äî-

So, as much as I delighted in his phones‚Äô text messages and email blowing up with *everything*, I left his response pager alone.    
That was ok, because I was consoled by what I‚Äôd find the next morning at his office.

He wasn‚Äôt in his office when I got there, and he‚Äôd unplugged the client PC! Shame that. I was looking forward to the rapid beeping announcing camera motion and door activity.    
However, he couldn‚Äôt unplug the ceiling mounted nurse call display. Which was going off it‚Äôs tits^* and displaying its heart out.    
*(Boring technical fact, you can set custom tones and durations for the chime speaker for different calls. And if you wanted to, you could make really annoying combinations.)*

Before I called Matt, I powered up my laptop, had his email reply ready, and then connected to the beepy systems.    
After he arrived with a steadily buzzing phone in hand, and got the whole ‚ÄúWhat the fuck did you do‚Äù and threats out of his system, I let him clearly see me stopping all the ‚Äúeverything‚Äù. His phone stopped buzzing and the display went quiet.

I showed him the email and told him he had double-dog-dared me to do this to him, and things could have been different if he‚Äôd only given me direction for what his ‚Äúeverything‚Äù meant. Well, this had the opposite effect of mollifying someone. I tried reason and logic, but he wasn‚Äôt having a bar of it. He wanted blood. I was half expecting him to throw out a ‚ÄúRespect my authoritah!‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt want to, but in the end, I agreed that yes, we should bring this to the General Manager. Where I could show my beautifully written attempt to clarify what he meant, listing every system in the Hospital, and play her the voicemails from last night.

‚Äî-

My firm grip on his balls extinguished the fire in his belly and we actually ended up sitting down and going through ‚Äúeverything‚Äù. The final list was small and pretty much what I would have logically given him, if he wasn‚Äôt a dick about it. He learned a lot about how a Hospital campus functioned that morning.

Because I still had to work with him, before I left, I gave him the ‚ÄúI hope we can work together better in the future‚Äù and shook his hand.    
He continued to be a tool for the remainder of his time there, but he was less of a tool to me.

Thank you for reading.

TL;DR; at the bottom.

Up until this point my journey through the exciting world of crypto currency has been, well, not that exciting.  I'm by default very risk adverse, and stood on the sidelines watching bitcoin multiply in value for years.  I almost got into Bitcoin mining several times in the 2010's but could never justify the initial hardware + electricity cost.  Obviously I'm kicking myself now, but oh well.

Fast forward to the  meme stock craze and GMEs initial run up, and I FOMO'd into DOGE on Robinhood like so many others.  Along the way I learned some technical analysis and did pretty good trading DOGE all the way from $0.05 to the top.  Obviously I had had enough of Robinhood, and started looking at some other exchanges.  I ended creating accounts on a few centralized exchanges (since the coins I was interested in weren't always on one platform or the other. This is enough to probably turn a few people off already).  I diversified into lots of other coins in the top 50 by market cap.  So far so good.  The learning curve wasn't to bad, I was familiar with stock brokers, and all the different order types from the meme stock craze.  It all felt pretty natural.  I just left all my coins on exchange. 

Fast forward a little more, and I started reading about DeFi.  I put some of my emergency fund into a stable coins to start earning \~8% APY.   I couldn't justify putting my entire nest egg in since it's not FIDC insured.  I applied for a couple crypto cards to start earning rewards back.  Still feeling pretty comfortable, and at home.   I'll grant that at this point I've probably done a whole lot more research and learning than most people are willing to commit to, but over all I feel like this level of exposure is achievable for most people.

Fast forward again to the last week or two, and watching micro cap coins pump like crazy.  Now I'm not trying to chase coins that have already run up like crazy, but I decide it's not a bad idea to gamble a small amount of money on some micro cap coins.  The problem, though, is non of these coins are on centralized exchanges, and by the time they do hit centralized exchanges you miss the crazy gains that make the risk worth it in the first place.  So I started reading about decentralized exchanges, and token swapping.  

This is where I think most people wont make the jump.  I started with a YouTube video explaining how to swap tokens on UniSwap. Which, being the largest and leading decentralized crypto trading protocol, fits more comfortability into my risk adverse nature.  This lead me down the rabbit hole.  After learning about UniSwap, I found my self learning about Metamask, liquidity pools, gas fees, why smart contracts are so much more expensive than simple transfers, etc...  As a software engineer I'm pretty good at understanding complex systems, but there is no way in hell I would expect anyone from my social circle to bother with learning all of this.... After spending the better part of a day watching YouTube videos and reading articles, I finally decide to give it a go.  I transfer some ETH from an exchange account to my newly created wallet, I headed over to [CoinMarketCap.com](https://CoinMarketCap.com) to make sure to copy the address of the correct coin (since it's not in the verified list in UniSwap), I did all the math to convert the token amounts to USD so I could rationalize the amount of money, I punch in all the info into the swap interface, I'm about to confirm the swap, and then the ETH gas fee is nearly equal to the amount I'm trying to gamble away on some shit coin. Which means in order to break even the coin would have to pump almost 100%, and then if I want to swap it back to ETH, transfer to an exchange, and cash out, I'm still out money.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR;  I think most people will be able to navigate centralized exchanges, and invest in coins that are listed.  Once you start diving into actual decentralized finance, however, 95% of the population is going to be totally at a loss, and unable to comprehend what they are even doing.  Until some of these hurdles are overcome, I think mass adoption is a pipe dream."

Wondering why everybody's talking about Shiba Inu? It gained 940% this month.

Key points

Shiba Inu tops the list with a nearly quadruple digit gain.

Cryptocurrencies can be volatile and unpredictable investments, which is why it's important to only invest money you can afford to lose and focus on long-term investing opportunities.

For David and Tom Gardner's latest thinking, and your Stock Advisor team's recent analysis,¬†click here¬†to visit your Stock Advisor premium membership site.

For some investors, the potential to make huge returns is a major attraction of cryptocurrency investing. And with monthly gains of 120% or more, it's easy to see the temptation. But chasing those high returns can be a risky way to invest. With over 13,000 cryptocurrencies to choose from, it has never been more important to focus on a coin's fundamentals and long-term prospects.

Often, the¬†cryptocurrencies¬†that see the really huge monthly gains are meme coins or highly speculative investments. That's why we've restricted our top gainers list to those that are in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, using CoinMarketCap data. Even then, there's a mix of speculative tokens and those that might perform well in the long term. And some are not available from¬†top U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges.

Let's take a look at which coins gained the most in October and why.

1. Shiba Inu (SHIB) -- up 940%

Shiba Inu¬†is one of the many pet coins that followed in the wake of Dogecoin's (DOGE) success. This month, it shot into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap following a tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk with a picture of his¬†Shiba Inu puppy. Even though Musk says he doesn't own any SHIB and has never promoted it, the cute pic lit a fire under the token.

Since then, a campaign on Change.org to get Shiba Inu listed with popular crypto broker¬†Robinhood¬†has gained almost 400,000 signatures. Speculation on a SHIB listing has pushed its price through the roof.

2. Secret (SCRT) -- up 389%

Secret is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that also has smart contract capabilities. Its price rose in anticipation of its Supernova protocol update, which will connect its network to¬†Cosmos (ATOM). Cosmos is an interoperability cryptocurrency that helps blockchains talk to each other, so this integration will allow the Secret Network to position itself as a crypto-wide privacy hub.

3. Fantom (FTM) -- up 159%

Fantom¬†is one of several Ethereum (ETH) alternatives that has posted huge gains in recent months. It held its developer conference in Abu Dhabi at the end of October and also announced a couple of interesting partnerships. Decentralized finance (DeFi) yield aggregator Yearn Finance went live on Fantom at the start of the month. And crypto-trading platform Open Ocean also announced a Fantom integration.

4. Harmony (ONE) -- up 136%

Harmony was one of our¬†altcoins to watch for October¬†after it announced a $300 million fund to attract developers. Like Fantom, this month it also hosted a big conference and announced key integrations with other platforms.

Harmony aims to solve some of the scalability and interoperability issues faced by the Ethereum network. It is faster, boasts lower fees, and can bridge to other crypto networks.

5. Curve DAO Token (CRV) -- up 123%

Curve is a popular decentralized exchange (DEX) that specializes in¬†stablecoins. Unlike centralized exchanges that need a platform to facilitate trades, DEXs allow users to swap coins directly. Stablecoins are cryptos whose price is pegged to a commodity like the U.S. dollar or gold.

Curve reached an all-time high this month in spite of¬†upcoming stablecoin regulation. This is because, according to Crypto Briefing, over 89% of CRV tokens have already been tied up or committed to various DeFi projects, leaving a limited supply. CRV tokens are a popular way for investors to earn interest through DeFi initiatives.

Be cautious about chasing the highs

Cryptocurrencies can be volatile and unpredictable investments, which is why it's important to only invest money you can afford to lose. There are so many factors we can't control -- as demonstrated by the fact that our top performer's success this month is down to a tweet from Elon Musk and an¬†online petition.

That's why it's less risky to look for coins you think might gain the most over the coming five or 10 years instead of trying to predict what might happen next month. It isn't easy because there's a lot of misinformation out there and very little regulation to help you trust what you read. Unfortunately, there's a good chance that many of the coins we see today won't survive. But by focusing on the fundamentals -- such as a project's management team, strategic direction, competition, the problem it plans to solve, and how it plans to solve it -- you can minimize your risks.

These five coins may have seen huge returns this month, and watching the top gainers is often a good way to understand crypto market trends. But big rewards this month don't necessarily mean big rewards in the future -- don't let those high numbers stop you from doing your own due diligence."
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to think. You just have to do what I ask for‚Äù.. a Sparkies Tale,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/qiq61h/you_dont_have_to_think_you_just_have_to_do_what_i/,OlderSparky,1,2021-10-30 08:33:20,0,/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/qiq61h/you_dont_have_to_think_you_just_have_to_do_what_i/,NaN,"This is another tale from the Hospital in a rural Australian town I used to live in. I have a few stories from this town, and this Hospital in particular. 

As an electrician who had a few decades of experience in different fields, I came to this town able to pretty much do anything required. Technical skills and a high quality of work, while being cheeky and personable, pretty much let me get away with a lot of shenanigans. I also fixed the General Managers home treadmill early on, so there‚Äôs also an element of knowing who to keep happy.

The electrical contractor I came to work with was the largest in the region, did good work for fair prices, and had the big Govt contracts for a lot of infrastructure. I added experience in the more technical and specialist side of the business, so the owner didn‚Äôt get too cranky when the times came to slap my wrist.

I relish any opportunities the Universe provides to help people get their Comeuppance Tickets stamped, and am keen as mustard^ for schadenfreude.    
With that, let me tell you about a bloke who voluntarily brought me much joy.


**‚ÄùMatt‚Äù**    
A standard issue Govt efficiency drive brought Matt to the Hospital in the role of Safety, Security and Compliance Manager. It was a smallish regional Hospital, ~120beds, in a smallish rural Australian town. Until Matt came, these jobs were done by other Managers or Executives as part of other duties. Being a newly created role, it was an absolutely perfect one for someone to come in and be a star.

Most people I‚Äôve seen go into new roles/jobs over the decades, they take some time to get the lay of the land. Get a feel for the politics. The interpersonal relationships. Become familiar with what their job is. Kinda like a sane, professional, reasonable approach.    
Matt‚Äôs approach was like some guy going into a restaurant with an industrial fan and a bucket of shit. Then getting all huffy when everyone is angry and covered in shit.

Now, to be fair, Matt wasn‚Äôt a wanker. He was a proper tool though. And he wasn‚Äôt an idiot, but his ego could make him seem like one.

He came from the Dept of Education in a similar but supervisory role. This was his first Manager gig. Maybe he thought you dealt with Hospitals, Doctors and Nurses the same as you did School Districts and Teachers? It didn‚Äôt take long before Matt was politely told that his unsolicited attempts to change clinical (medical) protocols wouldn‚Äôt be required. *(Without consulting anyone, he tried to change the way nursing staff handled Scheduled Drugs. I was told that the 13yr veteran Director of Nursing didn‚Äôt phrase the message this way. But I can‚Äôt write down what she said.)*


**Matt and I**    
From the get-go, I don‚Äôt think Matt liked me very much. Every time he tried to make changes that involved anything technical, he was told to check with me to see if it could be done or how much it‚Äôd cost. Changes/additions/repurposing to Door access, CCTV, Nurse Call, Security/Duress systems, Matt was directed to me quite a bit. He used to get so annoyed when I told him ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, or ‚ÄúYes, but you better check with Finance to see if there‚Äôs money for it.‚Äù I‚Äôm sure he saw me as a stop sign on his road to glory.

Hand on heart, I tried. In the early days, I tried to get along. Even gave him my direct email and mobile number so he could ask questions, because I knew it was a steep learning curve. I tried, right until he purposefully took some information I gave him out of context, presented it at a planning meeting, and tried throwing me under a bus. 

The little switch inside my head labelled ‚ÄòMatt‚Äô flicked from ‚ÄòOff‚Äô to ‚ÄòFair Game‚Äô.


**Fair Game**    
About 12 weeks later I received an email from the Hospitals Maintenance Manager asking me to see Matt. He wanted access to all the Hospital systems.    
*(All the systems I managed were stand-alone. Meaning they weren‚Äôt on any Govt IT network, they were completely separate, and I was the administrator. I kept everything running and the Hospital Executives were happy to let me just do my thing. With very little oversight.)*

Speaking with Matt, he wanted to ‚ÄúKnow everything that went on in the property.‚Äù It was a nice 20 minute conversation that I remember well, but will paraphrase..    
**Matt** - ‚ÄúI need to know everything that goes on here.‚Äù    
**Me** - ‚ÄúWell, *everything* is pretty big and a bit vague. Are there..‚Äù    
**Matt* - (annoyed) ‚ÄúI want to know, in detail, what goes on across the campus. It‚Äôs not hard to understand.‚Äù    
**Me** - (not showing that I‚Äôm happy Matt is annoyed) ‚ÄúI think maybe going through a list of systems and figuring out which..‚Äù    
**Matt** - (smug) ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the good thing about this relationship. You don‚Äôt have to think. You just have to do what I ask for.‚Äù    
**Me** - (outwardly stoic, but inside I was a Happy Little Vegemite^ ) ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll get on it then.‚Äù

There‚Äôs nothing quite like sitting on a veranda at dusk after work, sipping Jacks with Nic Cave softly playing in the background, mindlessly watching the wallabies. Just sitting and most definitely not thinking. About Matt, all the communications gear I had access to, and all the systems and plant in a Hospital campus. And his phone.. that, being a salaried Manager, he couldn‚Äôt turn off.

At some point the following day, while brainlessly programming some electronical gear, my ‚Äúfuckery filter‚Äù kicked in. I went and saw my mate, the regional Govt IT Manager. We had an excellent relationship, so when I asked ‚Äúhypothetically‚Äù just how many emails a Govt staff could receive in a day, they wanted to know what I was up to. After a brief chat, a nod and a wink, I left with some upper limits.

Unrelatedly, Matt‚Äôs inbox somehow turned out to be a smidgen larger than other people‚Äôs for a while.


**‚ÄùSorry to bother you Matt. I‚Äôm still unsure what exactly you‚Äôre after. If you‚Äôd like to know everything that happens, for clarity and transparency in moving forward, we have options to facilitate the merging of communications to effectively bring positive outcomes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù**    
*(What was I thinking! Putting as many buzzword bingo phrases as I could in the pre-amble.)*

It‚Äôs very rare that I engage in shenanigans without written CYA. *(Cover Your Ass. A verbal CYA is nice, but a written CYA is golden. A written CYA, worded to give you the protection of a Spartan Phalanx, is to me, a double-dog-dare.)*

The email I sent Matt, asking clarification of ‚Äúeverything‚Äù, was 7 pages long. It went into some detail regarding all the different things he could be made aware of, and how. It had bolded categories, italicised sub-headings, bullet points, and very many words. All I asked was for him to choose what he wanted.

For example. He could know when any of the 500+ doors were opened. Or when any of the damper motors in the air conditioning system opened/closed. Or when any of the 150+ CCTV cameras picked up motion. Or constantly know what temperature the boilers were at. Or when any patient pressed a nurse call button. Or the condition status of the medical gas supply. Etc, etc..    
It was a lovely email. Took a whole evening on the veranda just unthinkingly hitting the keyboard.

I don‚Äôt think he got past the pre-amble, because his reply was just, ‚ÄúYes. ASAP.‚Äù



**‚ÄùCan‚Äôt stop the signal, Mal. Everything goes somewhere, and I go everywhere.‚Äù**    
It was a Tuesday that I had everything ready and was at his office to install his very own 13 character IP Nurse Call Display, with chime speaker. And the CCTV Client PC/monitor, which also had a security/door access client on it. He was very chuffed. He mentioned out loud to himself that no other Manager had these in *their* office. *They* only had the pagers and phones. Like a braindead zombie, I showed him how to use his new toys. *(He did get a bit sad when I wouldn‚Äôt give him admin rights. To be honest, looking back, I wouldn‚Äôt have given myself full admin rights. Because, shenanigans.)*

An IP Nurse Call System, and a Building Management System, when interfaced with an enterprise level security/door access system has a lot of functionality. If you wanted to, you could single out one Nurse Call display and send it *everything*. Same with mobile phone text messages. And email. The possibilities are joyous.

At 6pm that Tuesday, sitting on my veranda, I vacantly looked at my laptop and hit ‚ÄúApply changes and Save‚Äù.    
15 minutes later, like a simpleton, I ignored Matt‚Äôs first phone call. He ended up leaving 12 voicemails. Each one shorter than the last, and each one increasing in vitriol. He really shouldn‚Äôt have sworn so much though, in recorded voicemails.

The Maintenance Manager called at about 7pm, saying he‚Äôd had an angry Matt call him, demanding cessation. After a friendly chat, he was okay with me looking into the ‚Äúweird and unexpected‚Äù behaviour of the reporting systems in the morning. He was also sick of Matt‚Äôs shit.


So, as much as I delighted in his phones‚Äô text messages and email blowing up with *everything*, I left his response pager alone.    
That was ok, because I was consoled by what I‚Äôd find the next morning at his office.

He wasn‚Äôt in his office when I got there, and he‚Äôd unplugged the client PC! Shame that. I was looking forward to the rapid beeping announcing camera motion and door activity.    
However, he couldn‚Äôt unplug the ceiling mounted nurse call display. Which was going off it‚Äôs tits^ and displaying its heart out.    
*(Boring technical fact, you can set custom tones and durations for the chime speaker for different calls. And if you wanted to, you could make really annoying combinations.)*

Before I called Matt, I powered up my laptop, had his email reply ready, and then connected to the beepy systems.    
After he arrived with a steadily buzzing phone in hand, and got the whole ‚ÄúWhat the fuck did you do‚Äù and threats out of his system, I let him clearly see me stopping all the ‚Äúeverything‚Äù. His phone stopped buzzing and the display went quiet.

I showed him the email and told him he had double-dog-dared me to do this to him, and things could have been different if he‚Äôd only given me direction for what his ‚Äúeverything‚Äù meant. Well, this had the opposite effect of mollifying someone. I tried reason and logic, but he wasn‚Äôt having a bar of it. He wanted blood. I was half expecting him to throw out a ‚ÄúRespect my authoritah!‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt want to, but in the end, I agreed that yes, we should bring this to the General Manager. Where I could show my beautifully written attempt to clarify what he meant, listing every system in the Hospital, and play her the voicemails from the night before.

My firm grip on his balls extinguished the fire in his belly and we actually ended up sitting down and going through ‚Äúeverything‚Äù. The final list was small and pretty much what I would have logically given him, if he wasn‚Äôt a dick about it. He learned a lot about how a Hospital campus functioned that morning.

Because I still had to work with him, before I left, I gave him the ‚ÄúI hope we can work together better in the future‚Äù and shook his hand.    
He continued to be a tool for the remainder of his time there, but he was less of a tool to me.

Who am I?
Im old.
I‚Äôve been a gamer since before 99.9% of people on this planet even knew what that meant.
I‚Äôve been playing games since before there were color monitors, before there were hard drives.
You have created a truly amazing game. There‚Äôs no way I would have put up with all its faults for so long if that wasn‚Äôt a fact. There‚Äôs no other game like it, it impresses me every single time I play it. The environment within each map impresses me most, but also, I often think about the calculations per second that must be occurring under the hood, and it just blows my mind. 
I unequivocally appreciate the effort and sacrifice the devs have put into this game, the experience that is Ark. I can see that effort in the game environment everywhere, and for that I am grateful for what you have given. Yes, I paid money for the game but still I appreciate and recognise the experience that has been provided by the teams of real people.
The first game I ever played was Pong, followed closely by Space War, wow! What a journey from there to my untimely end this amazing game!

So, what was my story in this game that I have now been globally banned from?

I started on legacy PVE from release day on PS4, (See my YT channel) then I moved to Official PVE, then to Official PVP. After 9 months solo there, I finally joined a 3-person tribe I felt I could trust, and I could trust them.
We played together on a Rag server for 6 months, slowly, oh so slowly making progress with small hidden bases. Then a tribe called DD moved onto the server. Don‚Äôt know if that stood for Death dealers or DDOS‚Äôers, regardless they DDOS‚Äôed the shit out of that server for the 6 months I remained there. They would dos it when they were offline, effectively creating their own offline raid protection. 
(See the video on my YT Channel called ‚ÄúDealing with Death Dealers)
I put in several tickets over the weeks and months and did not receive one single reply, NOT ONE!
It took us 3 months to move our tames and items off that server at 255 ping, we lost over half of our stuff trying to get it out at obs and drops.
That was the end of my first official experience, I couldn‚Äôt go on, the DDOS‚Äôers and your lack of reply got to me, and I thought; what is the point? 
But, my tribe continued on, they had plenty of leisure time to play and wanted to continue with what was recovered, but with my busy work/home life and all I had lost, most important of all time, I could not go on. I gave my tribe all I owned with no strings attached to help them on their way.
I decided to give unofficial a try.
I tried multiple servers and clusters, but I didn‚Äôt like the settings, or the fact that most of them didn‚Äôt last too long, or as most often was the case, I left due to corrupt or inactive admins.
So, I started my own cluster. I did the best I could to spend my time managing the servers, attending to people‚Äôs problems and most of all to be a fair admin.
But it was too much. I had the coin to finance it, but not the time, it‚Äôs not a thankless job for sure, but it‚Äôs not a fun job unless you simply love it. I just wanted somewhere to play reliably for the long term and as an admin I could not, as it just isn‚Äôt fair to your members, even If your honest as fuck like me, it just isn‚Äôt fair for the admin to play in the same game environment as well and for good reason, they all end up corrupt and so from my members point of view why wouldn‚Äôt I be? 
After all it was the very same experience, I had with admins on Unofficial that steered me to make the decision to start my own cluster in the first place and so, my cluster came to an end, it wasn‚Äôt the answer to what I wanted from Ark, I wanted to play the game on even terms with everyone.
So I gave Unofficial one more shot and found another PVP Unofficial cluster, financed, and run by an awesome admin, the best I had ever seen, better than me, she had time to do it and she loved it, unlike me, I didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all, I just wanted to play the game in a fair community-based environment and not have my shit despawned when I returned home from working away for up to 12 days at a time.
So, I became the major financier for her cluster. Not one single thing was provided to me in return for investing a substantial amount of money over 1.5 years apart from a wyvern paint job and some skins. You know why? Because I like to play the game, I love survival games. All I asked for in return was that the cluster would continue with the current settings she had implemented, so it that it remain relatively unchanged and reliable for the long haul players. 
She agreed and the coin flowed into that cluster, and it attracted a player base who were also looking for the long haul experience. Also, I didn‚Äôt receive any special treatment due to my support of the cluster because I wanted to be able to play, I wanted to be able to put my hand on my heart and say after battle, that my efforts were legit, and not as a result of being the major $$$ contributor.
It lasted a long time, but suffice to say, people seem to need change, even if everything is going well. The cluster‚Äôs settings and themes were changed against my advice after over a year of stability. The cluster pop emptied out over a period of months after that, but the new settings remained. I withdrew my funding, then the cluster died.
Well then, unofficial is unreliable for the long run, and Ark must be (for the long run for me) as my progress is excruciatingly slow as a casual player. When you don‚Äôt have time, ironically there‚Äôs only one way you can really play sustainably over a period of a year or two, 
SOLO.
‚ÄúSmall Tribes Official‚Äù is no good for me, there are too many people there for the same reason as me and they continually scour every inch of every map. Also, there are very few servers for my region, and I hate lag with a passion.
Solo on Official it is! It will be slow, oh so slow, but I think from what I have learned from unofficial, I can do it, and I have checked out quite a few servers and it seems we were incredibly unlucky to have our Rag server full of bobs being DDOS‚Äôed like it was. Usually, its mega‚Äôs doing it to each other, our situation was just very unlucky at the time.
Back to Official I go.
Do I join my old tribe? They are still going very strong, stronger and larger than ever and would like me to join back, do I re-join? I did, but after a while I left.
Only very few Ark players will understand this explanation, and I suspect the ones that do understand will all be solo players on PS4. 
OK, so why only solo?
The huge amount of text to follow is for only one purpose, to try and explain why I only play solo on PS4. What follows is a direct response to try negate the comments like the ones I got from a previous post on Reddit about solo life where a few people ripped into me for complaining. 
Only at the end of that conversation did I realise they were PC players. I realised after watching the videos they posted which were supposed to illustrate how easy it is to be solo. All the videos they posted to prove their point where PC based. The initial misunderstanding was my fault though, I should have flagged the post as PS4, but like most people, they also spent no effort in trying to understand my position as well. 
After watching those videos, I have one thing to say to all the PC players out there. ARK on PS4 console will eat you for breakfast if you think having all those options for camera angles and graphic settings is the standard experience across all platforms. There are very few tricks up your sleeve on PS4 to help you like there is on PC, there are very few servers comparatively, there are very few places to hide. I suspect that mobile or Switch players might quote a popular meme and call me an ‚Äúamateur‚Äù after that statement LOL!

So again, why only solo? That‚Äôs my choice, right? Tis true, but I‚Äôve tried all tribe dynamics on PS4 and it‚Äôs the only way that works for me for the long term or so I thought.
The one single constant that controls all other variables in the game is TIME.
When you don‚Äôt have the time that the game demands, that a large tribe needs, you CAN NOT be a valuable active member of a large tribe.
And usually, if you‚Äôre not valuable you are not wanted as you are a HUGE security risk, and rightly so, you need to be active to be trusted otherwise why are you there?
So why is it such a hard thing for a casual player to be a valuable member of a large tribe?
Because;
You can‚Äôt contribute anywhere near as much as active members. This leads to accusations of slackness. 
You can‚Äôt raid and, you can‚Äôt defend because you don‚Äôt have the resources, you don‚Äôt have time to raise, you don‚Äôt have the time, nay even the capacity to grind as much as the top 90% of tribe members. 
You don‚Äôt have time to learn the mistakes of PVP, to lose tames to PVP to then become better at PVP. 
You don‚Äôt have time to attend boss fights that always occur totally opposite to your time zone when your OC based.
You don‚Äôt have time or even the capacity to go out and do simple reso runs to contribute because you don‚Äôt have Telporters or Transmitters unlocked. Your stuck in a base with no way out. This is the normal set up for large bases in large tribes. If you are a casual bob in a large tribe on the opposite timeszone to most people in the tribe you can‚Äôt do much of anything at all! Your time slot is also when you get attacked, and the most you can do is bitch scream in tribe chat channels to get other players online. After a while its quite humiliating, so you ask yourself; Why am I in this tribe?
I know what most of you are thinking, ‚Äúof course you have the time to raise, tribe mates will assist, they will fill the troughs for you, just put out your shit and its all good, its not that hard man, maybe you don‚Äôt know how to function in a tribe dynamic, maybe you‚Äôre the problem?‚Äù. Well yeah, I know I‚Äôm the problem and my problem is time. But those arguments like the one I just quoted are flawed. Why?
It just doesn‚Äôt work like that in practice.
In the last 5 years I wish I had a dollar for every time I‚Äôve come home from work, filled all the troughs, put out the 1 to 3 tames I can allow myself time to raise, only to have a tribe member roll up and unpod 30 gigas and log off, or they go and do something else, or unpod a bunch of half fucked rexes to heal from a boss fight, or whatever it is, only to have all their shit die and my shit die as well along with it. Too many times! Im talking about many, many, MANY examples of this happening in a few medium to large tribes I‚Äôve been a member of over the years. It‚Äôs always the exact same scenario. Doesn‚Äôt matter that maybe I was raising that one giga for literally the last 3 months. The response in ANY tribe is always the same.
‚ÄúOh well that‚Äôs Ark, just raise more, I‚Äôll give you an egg, go again! ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got 6 billion gigas in cryo‚Äôs, I‚Äôve got an egg for you no problem.‚Äù
So, what happens when their shit and your shit dies?
What they do; 
They hatch a new batch of shit, do meat runs and perhaps pay a little closer attention this time, or maybe they don‚Äôt, or they do but now someone else comes along and does the same thing, or the tame you are raising just disappears never to be seen again.
Yes, the gestures from most tribe mates in most circumstances are always well intentioned for sure, but the consequences to me having my shit starve due to thoughtlessness means a huge amount of MY effort and time that I spent raising those tames in the first place is gone.
What do you say in response to the offer of an egg? ‚ÄúGee thanks, that‚Äôs great, thank you so much, ill give it another go.‚Äù Then you ask, ‚ÄúWhere are the eggs?‚Äù
They say, ‚ÄúIn that fridge down by such n such‚Äù. You get there and then 5 times out of 10 you report, ‚ÄúWell this fridge is empty‚Äù. 
They say, ‚ÄúOh snap! Really? Dayum!, who took all dem eggs!!?‚Äù, inter tribe drama  between your tribe mates ensues Blah blah blah, you don‚Äôt have an egg, not until maybe next week when more are hatched and you can actually get back on, rinse and repeat, end result is, those with time overcome and move on, you lose your progress and its debilitating when you are a casual. 
Or, maybe there was an egg in the fridge in that scenario and if so what happens then?
You cook it down a little then you go to work. You come back from working, update happens, can‚Äôt play, real life happens, can‚Äôt play, then you get on again, spend days cooking it down, on the ground, back to storage, rinse and repeat cos god forbid if you leave that shit out there‚Äôs a reasonable chance it isn‚Äôt going to be there when you get back, so you better store it. When every second online counts, you MUST play the safe game every single time. If you don‚Äôt, even once, peoples work ethics or moral ethics, or the Ark Gods will fuck you up every single time. 
Most people are good people, but it takes real mental effort to understand someone else‚Äôs situation both in real life and in Ark. The more time people have to play, the less valuable everything becomes to them. It is one of the main factors why powerful tribe members wipe beach bobs and shitty beginner bases, because to them its nothing, its like stepping on ants and I‚Äôve heard people say it MANY times, ‚Äúfuck em, they had fuck all, it will take them no time at all to re-build, should have built better, shouldn‚Äôt have built there.‚Äù 
No, again, that‚Äôs not how it works, it took them ages, the learning curve in Ark early or on is the steepest by far when compared to any other game I‚Äôve ever played, and I love the SoulsBorne series. Dark Souls for example is a damn kinder garden platformer game when compared to Ark. 
For fucks sakes people just let the bobs be! Honour in this game is rare as fuck. But when you see it, its so cool to behold. There‚Äôs PVP and then there‚Äôs pure toxicity. The latter rules the Ark. And Reditor‚Äôs comments of blah blah can‚Äôt let them build this and they need to learn that, can be shoved right up your ass! This isn‚Äôt my first rodeo. Don‚Äôt be a toxic fuck! If you‚Äôre going to raid bobs, then do it as a bob! I guarantee you will have more fun that way to boot! And once you‚Äôre done give them their shit back and maybe something a little extra with some friendly advice. Sure, they may still be really dirty at you but you know why, you know what it feels like, you were once them, help em out instead of popcorning their shit cos its useless to you!
Anyway, I digress. Back to why large tribes don‚Äôt work if you‚Äôre casual.
Life in the tribe goes on weather you‚Äôre there or not. Most things happen when you‚Äôre not there. The base gets hit, the server gets hit, shits got to be moved, your shit gets moved, the shit you ground out using bob tactics on a Rag server because you cant catch a boss fight to unlock TP or Trans, gets moved. Remember, to everyone else, that shit isn‚Äôt worth much, but to you it represents the last 3 weeks. So, you ask where your shit is, you say ‚ÄúI ground out that shit so at least I can participate in the next raid or defence in some decent capacity that doesn‚Äôt involve being a naked bob yelling ‚ÄúTrick or Treat‚Äù at the enemy from behind the turret towers. 
No one knows where your shit is, rinse and repeat multiple times in multiple tribes, in multiple servers, it‚Äôs always the same.
So, you grind out some more shit on your bob server using slow ass bob tactics. Another month passes. This time you get to participate in a raid or a defence. AWSOME! Lets do this thang!
NOPE
Blue screen blue screen blue screen. OK, stare at the loading screen for 20 minutes. ‚ÄúCan someone please grab my kit?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere is it?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs at this location near the thing.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not there.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been ally looted.‚Äù ‚ÄúWTF!, are we not all on the same side?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, but people just take shit man, it sucks but welcome to mega life, welcome to Ark.‚Äù 
But I spent literally weeks grinding that shit, now I got nothing, what do I do? 
Rinse and repeat. Trust me it gets old quickly. To function in a large tribe you MUST have the time required to overcome the loss of resources to game bugs, theft and PVP, the more time you have, the more opportunity you have to do proper big reso grinds for your tribe using the best know how and techniques.
What has been written here is only but an overview of the whole dynamic, there are many factors at play that I won‚Äôt detail.
So, what is the answer if you just love this game and want to play it for the long term, but you can‚Äôt function in a mega or large tribe?
SOLO, if your very time poor, you can only be solo and simultaneously try and build relationships based on trust with more powerful people. 
You generate you own items; you store those items as far away from everyone else in the game in caches on multiple maps, that way if one gets found it‚Äôs not the end of the world. Then you try to participate in boss fights and activities with the big tribes, because you wont progress as far as you need to on your own, you still need people as this game is meant to be played in large tribe dynamics, its not meant to be played solo, but solo can be done, and I have proven you can be successful, even if it takes you years to achieve your goals. 
Most Ark players can‚Äôt comprehend the logistics involved to do shit as a casual player and survive for the long term, only if you‚Äôre a solo player on the PS4 and like me, only if you have found a legitimate way, I suspect the only legitimate way, to survive and function for years as I have with a very busy real world/life schedule.
Only then could you truly understand my position. I know of one single other player who understands what is involved and I met him because I caught him raiding one of my hidden grinding stations and surprise! He was solo, he had honour even after battle and we became friends. 
Long term solo players are lone wolfs, we are ghosts that hide in the shadows and slink around servers like wraiths. Its very rare you meet another solo long termer on PS4 other than during a random PVP encounter.
The mechanics behind being solo on PS4 official are insanely slow and it simply means your progress is far from guaranteed; the podding, unpodding, the meat runs, loosing shit to being found, loosing shit to bugs,  the time taken to retrieve items from remote storage caches, the blue screens, the drop outs, refreshing timers, ‚Äúoh look the troughs are low again,‚Äù  ‚Äúoh look I logged on and just filled the troughs and I was just about to unpod but real life needs me RIGHT NOW, so pod it all straight back up and risk leaving it somewhere vulnerable until I can log back in 6 hours later, or 3 days later, or whatever the case may be, in order to hide it again properly, spread out over different locations. It all takes LOTS of time when your solo, but at least its only YOUR time and everything occurs on your terms. At least it‚Äôs only the game bugs and PVP that will create hurdles and brick walls in your way, not other tribe members, it‚Äôs the only legit reliable way to make progress there is.
In a large tribe the 3 seconds it takes most people to go to a fridge when you live in a base is equivalent to 30 minutes to 6 hours for me to retrieve the same tame, getting fucked by the Ark gods along the way, dealing with real life requirements in the process, further extending the time and risk it takes to do things. Yes, real life must always come first, I know many of you who ignore that fact.
Im sure there are a lot more Official PS4 solo players out there that understand what im talking about, I just haven‚Äôt met them, well apart from ones I may have had random PVP encounters with.
Solo is the only way for me, I would love nothing more than to be a sweaty in a big tribe or even a semi casual that can contribute positively, but that was never going to happen for me.
And yet I did contribute positively, I found a way, after all, this story was a success story until Wildcard ended it.
So, back to the story. 
After leaving unofficial and returning to official for the second time bummed aound as a solo player on a RAG server for about 6 months. I was the same server that was DDOS‚Äôed a year and a half before. Raiders and toxic shits would try to find me but never could until only recently (that‚Äôs the solo dude I was referring to before). Why? Because Im a Mesher? NO!
Because you can‚Äôt get raided if you don‚Äôt have a base. Not having a base is the ONLY way a solo player can operate for the long term. A base will always get found in the end, ALWAYS. 
I raised on rafts, I raised on Quetzals, (FUCK YOU to all the piss ant youtubers who gave away the idea of living on Quetzals for a few likes.) It was a great existence for a bob before then. 
With my play style, you can‚Äôt use a cryo fridge to store tames in, for that you need foundations, you also need noisy generators, that‚Äôs a base! 
You can‚Äôt store tames in a cryo fridge on a quetz cos it will get found, people scour the maps looking for them now, they are only a temporary means to achieve something and that‚Äôs it, just like rafts, they‚Äôre all short term highly squishy options.
In this style of play, every tame you own actually owns you as well, because you need to obtain fresh cryo pods and swap out the old cryo pods twice a month and you need to do this all with no base. I can see all the comments from all the shitheads now; 
‚ÄúWe have had our base for the past year, and it‚Äôs never been found and you just use Shadowmanes to wake up cryo sick tames, you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing blah blah blah‚Äù, just DON‚ÄôT! 
Refresh cryo pods twice a month I hear you ask? 
When your solo and live the non-base life, and you don‚Äôt have a massive amount of leisure time to play Ark, then what happens is, updates, real life shit, internet issues etc, they all compound together to be a huge factor slowing down your progress. It‚Äôs just part of what you must deal with. You MUST refresh your cryos twice a month for insurance against that shit, or you will lose your tames to death in a pod.
I need to try make this very clear for the people who don‚Äôt use their brains properly.
I love this game! What I have been trying to illustrate so far is the sheer amount of time and effort it takes to play the game the only way I can play it for the long term. 
I spent 2 years maining that RAG server. I am known, Im known to be generous, I help people, I give bobs stuff. To be honest, I gave people stuff because I just didn‚Äôt have the capacity to store it, nor the space, nor the time to spread stuff on multiple maps everytime I generated items. Remember, no beds, no beds where it matters most, a bed is a base. You need to physically go to that item cache the hard way. But I would rather see my less valuable items make a bobs day then it be popcorned. 
Anyway, I made lots of friends and associates. I‚Äôve had plenty of offers to join tribes, legit and ill-intentioned alike, I said no to all but it‚Äôs nice to have and acquaintances. So, I built casual relationships. 
But then one day, after a few years, a dude popped into my rag server and this guy was different.
He announced, ‚ÄúI want to start a mega! Who wants to join?‚Äù Everyone laughed at him lol, it was funny, but I could tell by the way he communicated in global he had some intelligence and so I sussed him out.
I said, ‚Äúhells yeah man! If you got the time and put your mind to it of course you can! Ill join you! But not on my main, never on my main, my main is mine alone.‚Äù
Well, he was a good dude, and he did have the time for a while to try make it happen, but he got busy in RL and he left, but not before he got us recruited into a mega! Alright! I‚Äôve always wanted to experience life in a mega, lets see what it‚Äôs all about!
Being in a mega was both impressive and disappointing, again, watch my vid readers if you want that illustrated. Not trying to sell my channel here, I think I have maybe 10 likes out of 20 videos. I recorded those videos for me and fiends to reminisce but also for anyone else that may watch and enjoy them.
So, as per the details of my experiences in large tribes above, the usual shit happened and not only that, but I also just couldn‚Äôt function in any of their bases. Im an OC -Asia player. All bases were in either US or EU. My typical experience was spending up to 6 blue screens to move from my room to a TP or feeding trough or wherever. At its worst I couldn‚Äôt leave my room, I couldn‚Äôt even get my character off server to attend the timers on my solo bob servers. What I just explained was typical for most of the experience. 
Again, to pre-empt all the comments about turning off this, using different graphics mode that, just DON‚ÄôT! For once just except that your experience is not everyone else‚Äôs experience!
Some bases/servers behaved better than others, some I could function in, but it never lasted long. I would log on after working away to find we have been moved to some other server or base location cos some other tribe or demographic needed that base, or we had been raided, often by meshers! or insided. ‚ÄúSo, where‚Äôs all my shit?‚Äù nowhere of course‚Ä¶nowhere.
So, life for me in a large tribe was,
-	Lag and blue screens.
-	Theft.
-	Insiders.
-	Being moved, disruption.
-	Lack of opportunity to function due to not having TP/Trans unlocked.
-	Lack of boss fights in your timezone. Yeah sure, I pulled the early morning session multiple times to be told that the BF has been postponed to the next day, or for another 6 hours, or they did it early etc, etc, it just didn‚Äôt happen for me.
There‚Äôs always a positive in most equations though.
It gave me lots of time to talk to people and build friendships and appreciate their real-life experiences. 
There were/are some very good people in these tribes, and they must be so careful of insiders and thieves and just all round shitfuckery, they trusted me, they kept me around.
I decided to go back to being solo full time, pretty much spending 98% of my time on my own on the servers in my region. 
This normally means you are kicked straight away from a large tribe or mega, but I wasn‚Äôt, why? Because my honour is my currency, my honour is my worth, I had value.
Over the past two years I had made friends with multiple tribes, some of them being enemies of each other. A couple of tribes being stand-alone alphas. I maintained a good relationship with them all because every one of them fully 100% trusted me. 
Never, did I ever take what was not given. Never did I share sensitive intelligence between tribes, which includes being very careful on how you edit videos for YT and or waiting until that intel has no value before posting.
Never did I do anything to compromise or sabotage their progress. 
As I said before, I like to PLAY the game, not cheat, not betray people, but play, what they do is their business.
I simply played solo and chatted with people for company and ideas and to hear the reports of their raids and defences and PVE life as another form of entertainment while I did my own bob ass thing. 
I would trade with them, I would participate in the odd grinding session, purple drops or vein runs on Extinction but that was it.
What did I want to achieve in my Ark Experience?
My long term goal was I wanted to ascend, I wanted to get my character as high level as possible, and I was going to make this happen on my own, not do the fights on my own, but make it happen for myself. 
Some generous friends gave me a few key tames that I could use to generate more wild tames and reso‚Äôs to function better SOLO. Another friend gave me some absolutely kick ass rex eggs to raise. It was a huge leap forward for me.
I spent the next 6 months hatching and raising those rexes, 100% solo on PS4 Official PVP.
Every single pod and unpod, 
Every single piece of meat, 
Every single imprint to 100%,
Every single saddle made, 
Every single artifact and tribute for the first 3 island boss fights.
Every single % of risk was mine alone.
Every single action of 1000‚Äôs and 1000‚Äôs of actions to function and make that goal happen was made by me and me alone. 
So, I ran island boss fights. I invited all the people I knew from different tribes who needed boss fights or wanted to ascend. 
Ascension cave was where some outside assistance came in to help make it happen because by that time we were on a roll and killing it, getting alternate characters through as well and people could see that ascension was happening.
I achieved what I said I would achieve, and I gave something back to those who trusted me and appreciate me. It felt really good to overcome all that adversity on my own to then put people who are members of large tribes and megas, through boss fights because it either hadn‚Äôt happened for their main characters just like it was for me when I lived with them, or people who wanted to put their alt characters through. 
Finally, I had proven my play style can not only work, but it can even have value for other people with lots of time to play Ark. Even though what I did for them was never expected /required, their trust in me paid off for them anyway.
This little old solo raft bob, got members in mega‚Äôs through the island and ascension.
A journey of 5 years in total to reach that personal high point! 
All the learning, the adventures, the heartache, the triumphs, the brick walls, the endings that were inevitable that directed me to the last journey that led to that moment of glory meant a lot to me.
And then, only weeks after that accomplishment you GLOBALLY  BAN my account for what I still don‚Äôt know, its not like you have told me, but I suspect it‚Äôs  for the following.
One of the tribes I made friends with ended up building a mesh base in Gen 2. 
They were a small tribe and were surviving up until they all got globally banned.
Just like any long-term base on Gen 2, its either a mega or its meshed. They‚Äôre everywhere. But I wanted no part of it.
I was a member of their tribe for a while, I spent probably all of two hours on that map since it came out. I got some of their tribe members through boss fights. I gave them tames that I felt had more value to them than to me. 
One day, I delivered some tames for them to clone, I wanted them back straight away cos again my shit matters to me when your solo, im not leaving them hanging around in someone else‚Äôs base.
I asked where their cloners are, they changed the name of the TP there to ‚ÄúCloner‚Äù and I transferred there. I must have died 6 times in that spot due to anti mesh. I managed to get one of the tames on the cloner for them, fire it up and by that time I had had enough already. I said, ‚Äúfuck this, you can have this life, im out of here.‚Äù I managed to get me and my tames out of there back to my solo server.
A few days before the banning I had got around to leaving the tribe, I never play there anyway, we just usually meet up on extinction to do drops.
The only other times all that red antimesh writing has ever come up for me before was when items on my raft have disappeared due to anitmesh from being half buried in a rock. 
Then, twice before, the ‚Äúat rest‚Äù animation of my squid pushed me into a rock and I died for the same reason. 
Once on the island while I was setting up for the boss fights, I was swimming near a rock and the same thing happened, causing me to lose a shit tonne of gear and progress.
I am not a mesher, Im not a cheat. You are banning me by association of a tribe that had a meshed base, but again there is no way I would report them or dob them in, to anyone! 
My reputation as being trustworthy is my worth. What tribes do is their business, I‚Äôll do my thing on my terms on my time. Their life isn't for me, good luck to those who do it, but it‚Äôs not playing the game and all I ever wanted to do is just play the fucking game.
So, you think I am mesher and a cheat?
So, by your logic I can‚Äôt be tribe members with anyone? Am I personally responsible for the actions of all the people I know?
It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre ever going to reply to any of my tickets, you never did once when I reported DDOS‚Äôrs. 
In the last 5 years, since day one on legacy on the PS4, I have put up with the following;
-	Dino‚Äôs falling through the map,
-	Blue screens, blue screens, blue screens, blue screens, blue screens, blue screens.
-	Characters being deleted during transfer.
-	Items disappearing from storage.
-	Items disappearing from my player inventory.
-	Items disappearing from upload.
-	Inventory items disappearing during transfer.
-	Roll backs, the worst one was 34 hours back in legacy.
-	Easily a Terabyte of fucking updates in the last 5 years causing yet more shit to decay or disappear while waiting for updating, always at the most inconvenient times. Why the fuck does Ark refuse to auto update, it‚Äôs the only game that does this.
-	Dupers, causing lag and roll backs.
-	DDOS‚Äôers destroying my tribemates and my work.
-	Mesher‚Äôs completely destroying my tribemates work.
-	People doing a GOD mode glitch destroying my tribemates work.
As per usual, after all the adversity I overcame in this game to achieve what I achieved, the thing that ended it all in the end was you Wildcard.
Its not PVP that scares me its shit missing in transfers, bad shit happening due to blue screens, losing all your shit cos you got too close to a funky rock underwater and then anti meshing kicking in.
Finally, my journey ends by being banned by I  can only guess, from association and losing it all.
Ark, Ark 2, the animated series, and anything that Wildcard produces in future can go to hell, what is the point when communication is only one way.
Surely its reasonable you can just reply sometime before like, for ever!
For those that say, ‚ÄúChill out man, it‚Äôs just a game‚Äù.
You could not be more wrong.
Mario Kart is just a game.
People need hobbies. Some people play golf, others go fishing or motorbike riding or play sports or whatever they do to make life worth living.
When you think about it, its what you do for fun that matters most.
After putting up with all the hard work it takes to function in society, to work your ass off, to raise kids, to put food on the table, to deal with trauma that life throws your way, your leisure time in the end is what matters most, it‚Äôs the reward for your efforts.
That‚Äôs why people get so passionate about their hobbies, about their sports, it‚Äôs what matters most.
Games like Ark, EVE and WOW to name a few are not games, they are hobbies, they are escapes to another world.
I love Ark.
For some people I know its all they have. I know people who play that have seriously debilitating cancer, or other serious medical conditions where its all they can do. Gaming is a cheap hobby, the adventure to be had for relatively little money is simply amazing. No, Ark is much more than just a game. But it‚Äôs a hobby run by an organisation that don‚Äôt believe in either acknowledging you or in second chances.
For those that may say, ‚ÄúYou associated with people who had a mesh base. Too bad, take your medicine.‚Äô
Yep, that‚Äôs true, but I did not profit from their choices. I did my thing, and they did their thing. If I had my time again, I wouldn‚Äôt have joined their tribe on that map, spending all of about two hours there. Is a life ban that destroys all the years of my hard-won solo work, really a fitting punishment?
Scenario: You have a friend that‚Äôs a drug dealer. Do you dob them in? Or do you keep your distance and let them, and their customers do what it is they choose to do? After all, do you want them coming to end you? Should you really nip at the heels of a pride of lions if you‚Äôre only just a solitary little mouse?"

[He asked, ‚Äúhow do you stick to a strategy?‚Äù The answer is risk management.   This is for OP, let‚Äôs say you have 100k and go long with 25% of your account. You have a stop loss at 10% from your entry. It hits your stop. You lose 2.5% of your total account, you still have $97,500 instead of losing 10% and having  $90,000 if you went all in. Let‚Äôs say it happens again. You now have $95,062.5 instead of $81,000. Huge difference. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre all in $100k cus it has to go your way, you‚Äôre not disciplined and you don‚Äôt get out and it‚Äôs a 30% crash. If you went in with 25% of your account, you‚Äôd still have $92,500 instead of $70,000. Let‚Äôs say you get margin called, your account is done. If you used a smaller size, probably wouldn‚Äôt get margin called. You‚Äôd have to lose 100% in that trade in order to be at $75,000.   The point is, the losses are much easier to manage. And because of that, it won‚Äôt be as difficult to cut your losses. This helps you stick to your strategy. And when you do slip up, cus u will, it won‚Äôt hurt as bad. You‚Äôll be able to try again tomorrow instead of blowing up your account and coming to Reddit.   An argument we‚Äôll make is, if I went in with $100k instead of $25k I would‚Äôve made $10k instead of $2500. Sure, that‚Äôs true. But as traders we kind of stray away from reality. Unless you have rich parents or a skill in high demand, these 9-5 jobs are giving you $2500 in a month. And we complain about trades where we can make $2500 in a day or a week. Your account will grow overtime compared to if you go all in all the time. You can always add more if the trade is going your way.   If you learn to be a decent trader now then your $5000 can grow to $100,000 in 3 years tops. Or you can be stubborn and keep blowing up your account making no money (or worse, lose money) over the next 3 years and still be at square one. (And I‚Äôm being generous. There will be another GME month and you can make 1000% in a month. Even now with SHIBA you could‚Äôve just made 700%. Or PHUN or DWAC doing 1000%. There‚Äôs always something.)](/r/Daytrading/comments/qhxzbt/blew_up_my_account_after_getting_margin_called/higxnye/)

**What is Aavegotchi?**

Aavegotchi is a DeFi-enabled crypto collectibles game that allows players to stake [Non-fungible token (NFT)](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/glossary#non-fungible-token) avatars with interest-generating [aTokens](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/atokens) and interact with the Aavegotchi [metaverse](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/metaverse). It is a unique combination of [Decentralized Finance (DeFi)](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/glossary#defi-101) and NFTs.

Aavegotchis are pixelated ghosts living on the Ethereum blockchain, backed by the [ERC-721](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/glossary#erc-721) standard. Their value is determined by rarity level, which is calculated via multiple factors, such as base [traits](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/traits), amount of staked collateral/aTokens, and equipped [wearables](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/wearables).

To level up their Aavegotchis, players can participate in a variety of activities including [mini-games](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/minigames), governance, and meetups. Aavegotchis can also increase their rarity level by equipping in-game wearables and leveling up.

Rare Aavegotchis not only have higher secondary [Baazaar](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/baazaar) value, they also enable the Aavegotchi to perform better in [rarity farming](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/rarity-farming)‚Äîa minigame that rewards the rarest Aavegotchis with GHST tokens.

Aavegotchi is governed by [AavegotchiDAO](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/dao) that manages all funds generated through the [GHST token](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/ghst) distribution.

**How do I get started with Aavegotchi?**

There are a number of ways to get started with Aavegotchi. All options involve having Aavegotchi‚Äôs native token, GHST, on Polygon. Polygon is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, utilized by a wide range of NFT projects.

There are a few different ways to buy GHST tokens:

* Buying it straight from the [curve](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/curve) on Ethereum Mainnet (though this requires KYC, which unfortunately precludes citizens of the United States and China)
* Buying it from Decentralized Exchanges on Ethereum Mainnet such as [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&amp;outputCurrency=0x3f382dbd960e3a9bbceae22651e88158d2791550) and [Matcha](https://matcha.xyz/markets/GHST)
* Buying it from Decentralized Exchanges on Polygon such as [QuickSwap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x385eeac5cb85a38a9a07a70c73e0a3271cfb54a7)
* Buying it from Centralized Exchanges such as [OKex](https://www.okex.com/spot/trade/ghst-eth#type=1) and [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/GHST_ETH?layout=pro)
* Buying it straight onto Polygon via [Transak](https://global.transak.com/). Click [here](https://defipm.substack.com/p/buying-your-tokens-straight-into) for a tutorial on using this method.

To learn how to bridge your crypto assets from Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon click [here](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/polygon#bridging-assets-to-polygon).

Once you have your GHST Tokens onto Polygon, simply connect your wallet to [aavegotchi.com](https://aavegotchi.com/) and you are ready to go! From there you can explore the Baazaar and shop for Aavegotchis, Opened and Unopened Portals, wearables, raffle tickets, and potions! Keep an eye out here on Reddit to know when we are holding #BidToEarn Auctions for new portals (known as Haunts) and wearables.

**How do I earn money playing Aavegotchi?**

The simplest way to earn money is to own an Aavegotchi and participate in [rarity farming](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/rarity-farming#rewards)!

Each Aavegotchi comes with six traits that define its Base Rarity Score (BRS). BRS is calculated using the following formula:

if (number &lt; 50) return 100 - number;

else return number + 1;

*If trait value is less than 50, BRS = 100 - trait value*

*If trait value is equal to or greater than 50, BRS = trait value + 1*

This means that traits closer to 100 are just as desirable as traits closer to 0. These traits include Energy, Aggressiveness, Spookiness, Brain Size, Eye Shape, and Eye Color. All traits except for Eye Shape and Eye Color can be modified with [Wearables](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/wearables) to improve BRS.

Rarity farming rewards payout leaders in three separate categories:

* BRS (Average Rarity Score to come in the future)
* [Kinship](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/traits#kinship)
* [Experience](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/traits#experience)

Other ways to make money on Aavegotchi include flipping items in the Baazaar (be careful not to get rekt), losing in our [GBM](https://www.gbm.auction/) \#BidToEarn Auctions and collecting interest from your Aavegotchi‚Äôs [spirit force](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/atokens).

**What is a Portal and how do they work?**

Portals are how you bring your Aavegotchi to life! Each portal has ten Aavegotchi‚Äôs with different traits and aesthetics to choose from. You can only summon one Aavegotchi from each portal. The other nine are banished to the Nether Realm forever, so choose Wisely! For more information on Portals and summoning an Aavegotchi click [here](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/portals).

**What is a DAO and how do I participate?**

A [DAO](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/[lang]/glossary#dao) is a decentralized form of governance, which allows token holders to vote in order to shape the way the organization makes decisions.

How to Participate:

First, you can participate in the discussions in the [AavegotchiDAO forum](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/). We welcome everyone!

Second, the [Aavegotchi Docs](https://docs.aavegotchi.com/overview/governance) details the list of DAO functions that members can call/use in order to implement changes that have been voted in. For example, let's say that asUSD has been voted in as a [collateral type](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/posts/atokens). AavegotchiDAO could implement the change by using the addCollateralTypes() function and specifying asUSD within the function.

**Minigames?**

What‚Äôs the fun of owning an Aavegotchi if you can‚Äôt play with it? One of the core experiences of the Aavegotchi game will be exploring the Aavegotchi [Realm](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/metaverse) overworld with friends and pitting your Aavegotchis against theirs.

Some mini-games will be played using simple random number generators (RNGs), whereas others will offer more immersive, player-controlled experiences.

Each mini-game will use different Aavegotchi traits to enable fair gameplay for a wide variety of trait distributions. For example, a HYPER-AGGRESSIVE Aavegotchi may perform well in an Aavegotchi Fight Club, but may not be well-suited to a cake-baking mini-game.

Have an Aavegotchi that isn‚Äôt suited well to any mini-game currently available? Jump in and develop one! To help support developers building Aavegotchi mini-games, [AavegotchiDAO](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/dao) V2.0 will manage a Development Fund that has been set up for supporting development work carried out within the Aavegotchi ecosystem. As long as mini-games conform to trait distribution standards, they can reward winners with XP.

**What about the Gotchiverse?**

Beyond the Human Realm, there is the Ether Realm, where smart contracts twinkle and dark forests lurk. Travel a bit further down the rabbit hole, and one eventually discovers the Gotchiverse Realm. When a yield farmer in the Ether Realm is liquidated, its spirit journeys to the Gotchiverse, where it reincarnates as an Aavegotchi. Aavegotchis are a spectral species who love nothing more than [farming](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/rarity-farming), [voting](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/dao), and shitposting with their frens.

The Gotchiverse began with only a handful of Aavegotchis, but as liquidations grew within the Ether Realm, so the population of the Gotchiverse burgeoned, with thousands of Aavegotchis exploring, building, and settling in its vast expanses, and even building great structures to worship the lickquidators, their creators.
