Getting started,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/r5tqah/getting_started/,SilentDevilMaster,1,2021-12-01 02:23:29,16,/r/MakerDAO/comments/r5tqah/getting_started/,NaN,"I'm rather new to defi and I had some issues that I hoping that you could advise me about. 

I wanted to start out in defi by doing some interest rate arbitrage with coins that are pegged to a fiat currency. I researched and dai seems to be the most optimal. The problem that I seem to be having is that  transaction costs make it almost impossible to be profitable without either having massive amounts of funds to work with to make the fees negligible, which defeats the purpose of decentralized  finance or have an unacceptable degree of risk to the point of having no risk management at all.

Here is an example of what I was wanting to do. My business has access to a line of credit with a 2% interest rate and interest only payments for up to 3 years. I wanted to utilize that low rate to either purchase etherium put it into a vault to mint dai then use the dai over several platforms to take advantage of the higher interest rates or just buy dai directly to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunities. The gas fees make it almost impossible. 

Do you have any helpful information to assist me in getting started and resolving this? 

Any information will be helpful. Maybe I'm missing a piece of the puzzle and I don't even know that I don't know. 

Thanks"

At 4.5M marketcap, a strong contract and an audit on the way, we can expect huge growth in the near future, many have already recouped initial investment in Polkadot reflections! If you‚Äôre the kind of guy that buys real tokens and not just meme coins, this is the project for you! The standard for pay-back tokens so far is flawed, with pay-back in the same token, taxes for all affect the price the same, redistributed taxes re-enter the market and cause drops. Which is why reflective tokens have become so popular in the past months. Taxes are applied in every transaction, which in turn purchase and drop a separate high value token to all holders with affecting the value of the original, giving passive income in stable high-marketap projects. For this reason and many other, InfinityDOT is a promising token, at the height of the bullrun, in a moment in which all chains are filled by meme-coins with no porpose that die within days, we have new token that provides actual value, and like it‚Äôs precedesor reflective tokens, it‚Äôs here to stay. As opposed to coins such as EverETH, or InfinityADA, InfinityDOT provides it‚Äôs reflection in Polkadot, a self-named etherum killer that has grown into a top 10 Marketcap coin with extremely dedicated development, community and an indisputable bright future ahead. Here comes InfinityDOT, while new tokens on Polkadot are still few in comparasion to the giants that are the Binance Smart Chain and Etherum, work for it‚Äôs future can start off-chain, with reflective tokens. InfinityDOT not only proposes as an investment opportunity it‚Äôs possible growth, but also the certain growth of a stable future token with a long history on the market. A future of the InfinityDOT token on it‚Äôs father chain that is BSC and a promising future on the parachain of Polkadot! The token has much work to do, the concept is promising, yet simple for anyone to understand, and compared to the majority of BSC Tokens, has a high survival chance. The team has just started going public, with a possible pre-sale to raise liquidity this week, a sale on DxSale to raise trust trough locked liquidity, a public open source contract to prove it‚Äôs security, and a perfect moment for a real project to start, in a sea of short-lived meme tokens, a real project is a real needle in a haystack. Of course DYOR, the project has barely started and has a long life ahead, the website is up and the contract will be published shortly, all we can do now is wait and verify it‚Äôs validity when the contract is published. Now that I‚Äôve spoonfeed you, start DYOR, whitepaper, roadmap and community channels available at [www.InfinityDOT.net](http://www.infinitydot.net/)."

I've been around the forum for a little while and have been holding MKR  since July and was wondering what your thoughts were on the apparent disconnect between the number of Dai in circulation and the value of the MKR token. I have seen Rune mention a valuation model places the fair value currently at circa 6K (dollars) and have seen similar before (https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/maker-dao-investment-and-valuation-3f34a236b723) but we're more than 50% down from that figure as it stands and have bled significantly on the ETH pair since August. Whilst this is definitely a long term hold for me as provided regulations don't prove problematic (which I believe they won't for Maker DAO relative to other stable coin issuers), I see owning MKR as akin to investing in a bank, we're nearing 10B Dai but that success isn't translating into value accrual for MKR holders. I will be interested to see how things pan out with the proposals on burning, tokenomics and onboarding on more RWA (including greener assets) but do feel there needs to be a greater incentive other than voting rights.

Anyway hopefully this hasn't come across as a 'when my bag pump ser' post as it's definitely not intended to, just seeing if there's any thoughts in the community on this topic."

As far as I understand, you basically double (less since you need over 100% collateral) your assets for just 2.5% interest?


If you borrow DAI and buy more crypto with it, and that crypto falls in value, I know that‚Äôs risky since you need to come up with the price difference when reimbursing the DAI.


But if you borrow DAI just to lend it out, there is no risk other than liquation right? Hence my question in the title :)


Do correct me if I am wrong somewhere, there‚Äôs no such thing as free money."

Or do you just let it sit there and pay it to keep your colleralization ratio in line? Do people generally just keep it open and then pay it all back at once when they want their ETH back? Doesnt a lot of interest accrue if you do this? 

Its just weird to take a loan out when theres no one sending you a bill every month. If that makes sense. Easy to lose track and get liquidated etc."
