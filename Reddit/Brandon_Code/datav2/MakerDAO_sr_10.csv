I therefore have some questions.

1. Is the DAI price determined internally by Maker DAO, and then supplied to Coinbase via Maker's own Oracle?
2. . Can the (exact) DAI price be determined by an exchange like Coinbase on their own, based on Coinbase's internal suppy and demand?
3. Couldn't Maker DAO simply create their own exchange, where they would sell DAI for 1 Dollar exactly to all incoming customers, simply taking the dollar, and giving the DAI in return? Why is this not doable?"

I recently left the Maker Foundation after it fulfilled its mission and began the last stage of complete dissolution, and following that I posted the Case for Clean Money on the Maker Forum, which is my take on the path the Maker Community should take going forward to stay true to its original values while charging ahead at the forefront of DeFi and bring the wonders of this movement to the mainstream.

You can check out the (very, very long) post here: [https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-case-for-clean-money/10684](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-case-for-clean-money/10684)

You can also listen to this (very, very long) podcast on bankless where I go into deep detail about both the Clean Money case as well as other recent and relevant topics. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1880RYS9f2Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1880RYS9f2Y)

The overarching idea is split into three parts:

1. First of all I believe MakerDAO needs a clear vision that can turn it into a purpose-driven DAO and help the community to set aside their differences and instead just collaborate to produce results. There is no better or more suitable purpose for a world currency, than trying to fix the catastrophic damage the financial system is right now doing to itself. DeFi and especially a decentralized stablecoin is the perfect coordination tool to help humanity try to overcome this self-destructive tendency caused by excessive short term thinking. This is not just a charity case, I believe this is also the most self-interested and profitable path for the Maker community and MKR holders to take, as it will provide the greatest amount of attention and branding amongst regular people in the real world (tesla is a good example of how well this can work in practice), political resilience (as climate is increasingly becoming the number 1 political issue in many countries), but also the massive changes that will happen to the world because of climate change are undeniable, and being able to tap into Climate Alpha which will determine which assets will be valuable in the future, and which ones will become stranded, is critical in order to create a currency that will hold up and even thrive, when the consequences of climate change finally cause the dominoes to begin to fall for real.
2. To really tap into the value and potential of the Clean Money vision, I propose a new set of very aggressive tokenomics upgrades, including issuing a lot of MKR and using it for growth, such as providing profitable yield farming to ETH vault users where the DAO distributes MKR, but gets even more cash income in return that can then power the tokenomics and benefits of holding MKR. The other key aspect is to provide very attractive direct benefits to long term MKR holders through a system called the Sagittarius Engine that will enable MKR holders to lock up their MKR and either use it as collateral for loans at 0%, or some other benefit such as high APR direct cash payments. The goal is to encourage MKR holders to lock up their MKR for the long term, and in doing so push them over the edge to begin to become more vocal and actively involved community members that can help control and be a check on the governance bureaucracy. We can use aggressive tokenomics to target some ambitious goals, such as getting 10% of the entire ETH supply locked as collateral in Maker, and get 50% of the entire MKR supply locked up long term in maker governance and be highly active community members that help regulate and secure the system and its bureaucracy. Overall I believe this will massively increase the value for current MKR holders today, including myself, especially if we combine it convincingly with the Clean Money vision as this will allow for a massive influx of a new generation of community members that are inspired by the vision, and financially locked for the long term through the tokenomics system. I think we can aim to 100x the number of active community participants and voters that are just regular MKR holders and not in core units or getting paid by the protocol in some special way. Only with such high numbers of regular MKR holders working together and with aligned incentives can we achieve the last goal.
3. An overhaul of the Governance processes and mechanisms that builds on top of what already exists, but improves it and makes it more transparent and efficient. I think on this subreddit we often see a lot of frustration with the lack of transparency around the budgets going to the core units - as a regular MKR holders it often feels like it's just a black hole sucking up value with providing any sort of benefit in return. In reality there is a huge amount of value being created, especially now as the Core Units have started to really hit their stride - but there is no denying that it absolutely critical that MKR holders are in charge. Maker Governance needs to be by MKR holders, for MKR holders, and while we need to increase the resources and budgets that are provided to Core Units a lot more, this needs to be done in the context of systematically ensuring that all work that is done is clearly providing a positive ROI, and this is communicated clearly, and transparently up front before any work is done, with professionals following up and helping the community to continuously assess whether the work that is being done is actually providing tangible value, so the community can cut off projects that aren't delivering, and redirect value to the core units that are providing the best possible return.

My goal with coming back here to this subreddit is that I hope it can once again become a vibrant and central place for deep and detailed Maker Governance and community discussions, and help act as a place where regular MKR holders can coordinate to monitor the performance of the governance bureaucracy, and mobilize to take combined action when there are things that can be improved.  


So to get things started I just want to signal that I will be a lot more active here, and then answer any questions you might have about the topics above, or anything else related to maker or some of the ongoing decisions that are happening in Governance right now."

Discussion: Making Maker Fractionally Reserved (a bit of a why and how),https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/q8thdv/discussion_making_maker_fractionally_reserved_a/,samskiter,1,2021-10-16 01:41:44,2,/r/MakerDAO/comments/q8thdv/discussion_making_maker_fractionally_reserved_a/,NaN,"I've been out of the Maker loop for a while now so excuse my ignorance (imagine I wrote ""IIRC"" in front of every sentence!) if anything here is out of date or just stupid, but here's something I've been mulling over in the shower for a few months:

**Why a fractional reserve \*might\* be a good idea**

The TRIBE showed a clear appetite for a fractional reserved stable coin - just the stability mechanism didn't work. And it now seems like they are proposing backing FEI with DAI... which seems... pointless. Well I had a look at MAKERs collateral stats and $3.5BN of $14.8BN TVL is other stable coins. Put another way: $3.5BN of $6.8BN total supply is backed by stable coins. 23% of Makers collateral is other stable coins and **51% of DAI is backed by stable coins.** It does raise the question - is DAI truly an algorithmic stablecoin is 50% of it is ultimately backed by real dollars somewhere?

The other point to add about all this stablecoin collateral is it has a constant cost on Maker/DAI - it all accrues interest through stability fees. I've posted before about viewing DAI governance as a PID (proportional, integral, derivative) problem. Through this lens you could see that over the long term, there is some stable ""base"" demand for DAI. The problem is the only control we have at the minute is the stability fee and we can't push that negative to inflate the base supply of DAI. (A PID controller would push the lever negative to 'integrate up' the supply of DAI). As a result we'll always have some cost in the system working against DAI...

**How fractional do you go?**

Following on from the idea of a 'steady state' demand for DAI I think there's a less scary way to look at fractional reserves - not as some endless pool of money that we keep printing, but as something we can algorithmically control. I.e. we embrace PIR control and think about what is the integral term? i.e. ""over the past 5 years, total DAI in circulation has never dropped below $2.3bn, so let's aim to have $1bn unbacked DAI in circulation so we have some wiggle room"".

I'm proposing that the proportion of unbacked DAI is controlled by governance votes and careful analysis of the historical demand for DAI.

**Options for a fractional reserve**

1. **Negative interest rates on loans** \- This is the most often talked and argued about system to decouple DAI from collateral. The problem is that the interest rate becomes both the stability mechanism AND the way we inflate or deflate how much DAI is fractionally owned. If we want to drastically change the amount that is fractionally held, we would have to drastically change the stability fee. Example: If the total DAI in circulation decreased and came close to some threshold, we would therefore want to decrease the unbacked DAI by increasing interest rates - this would bump up the price of DAI. Granted a decrease in DAI in circulation is probably due to a lower price - but with only one lever to pull we can only respond to EITHER price OR the fractionally backed amount at a time, not both.
2. **Don't destroy all repaid DAI** \- So here's my shower thought - currently the DSR is funded by interest on loans. When you pay off your collateral debt, you pay the DAI you borrowed back, which is destroyed, plus a little extra. This DAI is sent to pay the DSR pool and any excess is used to buy and burn some MKR. Rather than destroying \*all\* the DAI when you repay, we could keep some back and either put into the DSR pool or use it to buy and burn MKR - this would create unbacked DAI. We can remove unbacked DAI by doing the opposite - destroy both the repaid DAI AND the stability fee. So now we have a new lever to pull - how much DAI is destroyed when repaying debt and how much is kept around. This allows control of the fractional reserver that is separate from the stability mechanism. The ultimate backstop is still MKR, which could be used to buy up any spare DAI (provided the market cap of MKR is kept above the total Unbacked DAI).

I know unbacked DAI/negative interest rates is a controversial topic - but genuinely up for civilised discussion about this :)"

They only could do it with contracts that are centralized (USDC, Tether, PAX). What about Maker with their share of USDC ? They could indirectly enforce Circle to freeze the USDC. Do we have a plan ? Have someone simulate this game where a regulator freeze an asset in a contract ?
