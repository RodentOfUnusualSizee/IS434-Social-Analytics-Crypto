Centralized vs. Decentralized factors aside, is the appeal of Compound in this case that they offer a percentage of the payout in COMP, which has the possibility of price appreciation (along with its inherent usefulness?)

Hi Reddit, I recently wrote a blog post about Compound to help me learn how the protocol works. I tried to keep it as ELI5 as possible so it's full of drawings and clocks in at a 6th grade reading level. End to end it's about a 5 minute read time.

If you know anyone who's trying to wrap their heads around how defi and crypto please share, happy to answer any questions they have in the Twitter thread below.

Thinking goes like this:
- you supply ETH to Compound
- Borrow USDT from compound 
- Tether freezes all USDT for whatever reason (eg it turns out it is unbacked) 
- you cannot close your loan, so your ETH is stuck perpetually

Is there a way to solve this outside of eg governance voting to shut down all USDT positions?"

There are valid concerns surrounding public voting as well which has led to this discovery. 

SecretSwap, an automated market maker on Secret Network has just had governance go live! $SEFI holders can now participate in shaping the first front-running resistant, cross chain and privacy-first AMM. 

It also marks the world's first private voting application on a public blockchain. This will allow $SEFI holders to create proposals and vote privately on the future of SecretSwap.  

With the Terra Bridge and Monero Bridge on Testnet and an aim to connect to IBC in September, there is a lot to look forward to on SecretSwap.
