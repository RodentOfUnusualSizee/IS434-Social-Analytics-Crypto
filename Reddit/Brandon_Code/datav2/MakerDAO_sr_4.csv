Outrageous fees for sending very small amount?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/mhd3ic/outrageous_fees_for_sending_very_small_amount/,M0ND0_DUKE,1,2021-04-01 03:00:22,7,/r/MakerDAO/comments/mhd3ic/outrageous_fees_for_sending_very_small_amount/,NaN,"I'm rather new to crypto and I'm very confused about something. I bought some DAI in Coinbase as my first crypto to tinker with. I am trying to send a very small amount of DAI (around $1) from my Coinbase account to an outside wallet of my own to test out the process and learn what I'm doing, but when trying to do so the platform is attempting to charge like a $7 network/mining fee for sending just $1.

This is obviously absurd, and it's hard for me to believe that it would actually cost so much just to send a tiny small payment. Shouldn't the fees be based more on the amount of the transaction or something? Is this normal with all cryptos or just a few? Are there any currencies that I can send between wallets for free or very little cost?

I was led to believe that crypto was the way of the future and way better than the traditional banking process and online economy in general. So how is that the case when it's much easier and cheaper, even free, to send/exchange cash between people/accounts? Especially with newfangled services like CashApp, Venmo, debit transfers, etc.

Please help me understand!"

Since I have a lot of extra time due to the Covid situation here in Sweden, I decided to do a day trading challenge this year, which I’ve been doing since February 2021.

The challenge is based on a strategy that I created based on my trading result calculator and it’s actually working out really good so far.

I’m 36 trades in and up +636% already. My vision is to increase my trading account by +80000% this year, going from 100 USD to 80k USD.

I know it sounds insane, but I actually have a plan for this.

All the best,

Instead it's more like ""Maker is making x many DAI and pulling in y amount of fees"" therefore z Maker will be burned and increase the value of each Maker -- oh yeah, and it's also traded on an exchange (so speculators can speculate).  

It's a devilish asset to try and price, or to even try to predict how Maker's value will increase over time.  

Does anyone have a good methodology to try and price Maker that takes into account different growth models (increasing DAI at current rate, decreasing DAI, and moderate growth of DAI over time) and that assumes the current Maker burning policy remains in effect?"

I’m thinking ill mint some DAI but a few questions or maybe just a question followed by more depending on the answer: am i right to think that the only real risk is either the price of ETH dropping or me simply not maintaining my ratio?

in regards to maintaining my ratio, I would only need to worry if I’m particularly over leveraged  and the price of ETH were also to drop drastically correct?

meaning if i borrowed at 100%, as long as ETH maintains its price or performs better, I should be fine from liquidation right?

also, can you borrow less than 100% of your collateral and still be in acceptable parameters?

Seems to be the biggest ICO 2021. It reminds me of 2017.


The project is unique in the crypto space and if it starts to get more attention it can become a very popular coin.

Anybody can create their own token on top of StudentCoin via a web interface. No programming skills required.
If you stake StudentCoin (STC) you earn from all transactions of the tokens on top of STC. Students are the future and bring innovation and proper use cases.


In two weeks they just launched their wallet, mobile app and announced 3 exchange listings.


The team confirmed that STC is going to be listed on 9 new exchanges from the top 50 (a few from them are top 20 and top 10) from May 2021.


Their presale is currently live and 109 of 150 phases are finished.


A review is nothing without negative points and criticisms:

  - Communication of the team could be improved

  - There is a lot of FUD.. The team could just clear this up better and comment on all the criticisms. To improve that they are planning to make a team interview series from next week to be closer to the community.

  - The 500 universities are not all real partners.. they just have students from those universities as supporter.. its not clear which universities are partners


The ico price is still really low with 0.018 USD.


A small portion of the circulating supply is beeing traded on Uniswap for 0.026 USD already.


StudentCoin is already on CoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/student-coin/


StudentCoin Twitter: https://mobile.twitter.com/studentcoinorg


There are three options to participate:

  - buy STC via Credit Card

  - send ETH from your MetaMask wallet

  - send any crypto to the Coinbase Commerce payment method


I just found out you can buy the coinbase packages but send more than the package price.. you will receive the correct amount of STC even if you overpay the package.


I recommend using Litecoin due to its low transaction fees.


Coinbase Commerce works also for US investors.


Use this bonus code to get 5% more at the purchase.


CODE: Sxlb8setj7


Or the link: https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sxlb8setj7


I would appreciate if you support me :)

**What is Student Coin**  
The [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) its an example of how blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance could revolutionize the world.

The main function in my opinion is the STC Terminal, a crypto platform that allows users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

Also they already develop a supporting wallet and an exchange system where users can swap coins and tokens are coming soon.

The most groundbreaking idea of [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) is to empower students to issue their own individual tokens that people can buy to invest in their education and thus finance the rising cost of tuition. In this case the investors will, in turn, gain a percentage of the future earnings of the student’s career.  
**Main Features**

**STC Terminal**  
The most interesting function in my opinion. as explained above it will basically allow users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

**STC Exchange**  
This function will provide the possibility to exchange the coins that will be launched using STC Terminal and also existing crypto or tokens.  
**STC DeFi / Stacking**  
I don’t have much information about this but they will provide some options for stacking or even participate in liquidity pools.

**STC Crowdfunding**  
Possibility to join crowdfunding in university-based startups or students.

**STC Wallet**  
The wallet is already available for download at App Store or Google Play. For now it’s an earlier version with no functions like exchange, deposit, withdraw.

Now, Sai doesn't exist anymore and I should be able to open my CDP either over the Migration or the Oasis app.

First question: Does it matter which app I use to get to my CDP?

Second question: I use a Ledger Nano S where there always five wallets suggested to chose from. Now, the wallet I used for creating the CDP wasn't suggested in the first 15 tries (75 wallets). Is there a way to get to my preferred wallet in any more economic way than just try and error?

Many thanks, it's a substantial amount of money."

  In a nutshell?
  

  This brings consumer protection to Crypto and Crypto to every PoS-Terminal.
  

  To every supermarket. To every shop and every store.
  

  This is the missing bridge from crypto to the real world, the last puzzle piece to everyday mainstream electronic payment adoption.
  
 
  ""A solution that introduces consumer protection concepts from the traditional card payment industry to any blockchain with support for smart contracts like Ethereum,
  Cardano (ADA) or Solana. Created for Payment Service Providers (PSP) and EFTPOS devices with full support for backward compatible financial protocols like ISO8583
  enabling crypto payments in standard terminals.""
  

  This is not financial advice, do your own research if you like the project, but check out this very interesting white paper:
  https://static.hips.com/pdf/white_paper/merchant_token_white_paper.pdf
  

  To me this looks like an undiscovered hidden gem. The missing piece for crypto payments to reach massive market penetration and mainstream consumer acceptance
  in a global mega market (PoS? I mean, EVERYWHERE!) and with the potential to explode as soon as this hits the exchanges (July 2021).
  

  The ICO started on 1 April and is scheduled for 90 days until end of June, but already sold out 50 of 100 phases after only 10 days 😱😱
  

  Very important additional aspect for my investment decision to BUY:
  

  Only 100 Million tokens total supply – still at only $0.75 each right NOW !
  

  Compare to 1 Billion DOT, 2 Billion Filecoin, 45 Billion ADA, 100 Billion XRP !
  

  Best part? Mainstream investors and even crypto influencers haven't even heard of it yet"

Is there ability to migrate the peg in any way?

My initial thoughts are that in such a case one way to maintain stability is to establish a peg to an 'energy' and 'store of value' crypto exchange pair. The first example I can think of is a BTC/ETH pair using some form of inter-chain operability or decentralized wrap protocol for BTC.

[https://medium.com/pov-crypto/dai-is-not-1-dollar-470c5e00abd4](https://medium.com/pov-crypto/dai-is-not-1-dollar-470c5e00abd4)

It makes sense that rather than the Dai being linked to some fluctuating value, its actually forming the anchor for the Ethereum ecosystem, currently the anchor is the central bank USD but I haven't thought of any inherent reason it must be a centralized currency peg.

In my view, in a theoretical centralized fiat-less future the value of something widely considered a store of value in terms of energy used to do work (i.e. EVM computations) ought to be relatively stable. The amount of energy per unit of store of value would fluctuate based on demand for energy, but the store of value itself being decentralized and held by individuals would stabilize that end of the ratio.

From there it seems like it would then essentially allow Dai to become a form of self-sovereign fiat trusted for the same reason as everything else on the network and so universally accepted on the network

One obvious problem is how to source the exchange values of the pair across a likely fragmented ecosystem of exchanges and find some consensus on ratio.

The main function in my opinion is the STC Terminal, a crypto platform that allows users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

Also they already develop a supporting wallet and an exchange system where users can swap coins and tokens are coming soon.

The most groundbreaking idea of [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) is to empower students to issue their own individual tokens that people can buy to invest in their education and thus finance the rising cost of tuition. In this case the investors will, in turn, gain a percentage of the future earnings of the student’s career.

Classic crowdfunding does not work anymore, or better still, it’s working as usual but the concrete results are limited. It goes without saying that fundraising is a difficult task for every organization, because they ask people to trust them completely. Frequently contributors don’t even have the possibility to know how their money is actually spent and cannot follow the evolution of the projects they have funded. ENV Finance’s main goal is to give contributors total transparency of the money flow, from the initial donation to the final project reports; in addition, ENV Finance wishes to attract contributors by rewarding them for their donations, through a simple reward allocation program based on a ENV token, the new token introduced to Binance Smart Chain. Many big organizations like Greenpeace or WWF already accept donations in cryptocurrencies .
 
Pros
•	Transparency: all transactions are publicly registered in the Binance Smart Chain in real-time;
•	Traceability: every transaction, and every token transfer, can be tracked from its beginning, because all transactions and relative wallets are linked in the Binance Smart Chain.
•	Incentive: contributors are incentivized to donate tokens, so they can get a reward; it’s of common interest that funded environmental activities are actually completed.
•	Ease: for blockchain users it is very easy to use the ENV Finance fundraising system, it’s just a transaction from their wallet to the wallet of the project they want to fund.
Tokenomics
 
Max supply 123,000,000
•	Team 10% 12,300,000 (locked until 31-12-2021
•	Advisors &amp; Early partners 20% 24,600,000
•	Initial liquidity 10% 12,300,000
•	Token sale 20% 24,600,000
•	Ecosystem (rewards and bonuses) 40% 49,200,000
Initial market supply: 1,000,000 (circulating supply will be increased by reward mechanism and listing on exchanges).
 
Reward mechanism
 
Contributors can choose a specific project to fund, and when it’s completely funded they will get a reward, based on time they have locked their funds into that project and on the amount. Rewards are diluted over time to prevent dumps on the market. On the other side, the collected funds are given in many steps to the organization that has proposed the project.
 
Partners
ENV Finance is building the network of organizations managing the environmental projects and activities, and has already found some international organizations who accepted to be hosted on the platform.

Context: Imagine you have your entire net worth in crypto and want to use it for day to day stuff, like paying your credit card bill, for example.

You don't want to sell your crypto and withdrawal USD because 1. that means you're no longer HODLing and 2. that's a taxable event.

By loaning USD you can pay your mundane bills and then repay it over time using a stablecoin, eg USDT or USDC. 

Does anyone know if that's possible at all?"

3. Convert USDFL to USDC/USDT

4. Add more liquidity.

6. Once satisfied with earnings, I can sell my borrowed liquidity for USDFL, pay back my Freeliquid loan, and regain secure control over my LPs.

**What is Student Coin**

The [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) its an example of how blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance could revolutionize the world.

The main function in my opinion is the STC Terminal, a crypto platform that allows users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

Also they already develop a supporting wallet and an exchange system where users can swap coins and tokens are coming soon.

The most groundbreaking idea of [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) is to empower students to issue their own individual tokens that people can buy to invest in their education and thus finance the rising cost of tuition. In this case the investors will, in turn, gain a percentage of the future earnings of the student’s career.  
**Main Features**

**STC Terminal**  
The most interesting function in my opinion. as explained above it will basically allow users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

**STC Exchange**  
This function will provide the possibility to exchange the coins that will be launched using STC Terminal and also existing crypto or tokens.  
**STC DeFi / Stacking**  
I don’t have much information about this but they will provide some options for stacking or even participate in liquidity pools.

**STC Crowdfunding**  
Possibility to join crowdfunding in university-based startups or students.

**STC Wallet**  
The wallet is already available for download at App Store or Google Play. For now it’s an earlier version with no functions like exchange, deposit, withdraw.

**Tokens Coming soon in STC Platform**  
Oxford Student Token (OXF/STC)  
Melbourne Student Token (MLB/STC)  
STC LP Token (It seems to be for liquidity pools)  
Smart Marketing  
Greenfield  
LeanTrix

HIPS Payment Group Ltd. is a provider of innovative and cost-effective e-commerce and mobile payment solutions. Built on cutting-edge technology, Hips is disrupting the finance industry with its Payment gateway for Point of Sale, e-commerce, and m-commerce, a fully integrated, digital financial commerce platform with full reconciliation and financing support.

HIPS Merchant Protocol (HMP), the Hips Merchant Protocol Gateway (HMP-gateway) and the governing Merchant Token (MTO) is a solution that introduces consumer protection concepts from the traditional card payment industry to any blockchain with support for smart contracts like Ethereum, Cardano (ADA) or Solana, which we believe is the missing piece for crypto payments to have a market penetration and acceptance among mainstream consumers.

HIPS Merchant Blockchain is the native blockchain for HMP and Merchant Coin (MEO), optimized for real-time Merchant transactions created for Payment Service Providers (PSP) and EFTPOS devices with full support for backward compatible financial protocols like ISO8583 enabling crypto payments in standard terminal messages, using the existing terminal, and card scheme infrastructures for crypto payments in Hips Merchant Blockchain.

So, you have the money to pay back your debt within hands reach but if price of collateral drops heavily while you sleep (blitz crash) you still can still lose your collateral. 

Is there a service that you can pre-approve to be able to pull your stables from a farm and pay back your debt if your collat ratio drops below a given percent?

**What is Student Coin**

The [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) its an example of how blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance could revolutionize the world.

The main function in my opinion is the STC Terminal, a crypto platform that allows users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

Also they already develop a supporting wallet and an exchange system where users can swap coins and tokens are coming soon.

The most groundbreaking idea of [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) is to empower students to issue their own individual tokens that people can buy to invest in their education and thus finance the rising cost of tuition. In this case the investors will, in turn, gain a percentage of the future earnings of the student’s career.  
**Main Features**

**STC Terminal**  
The most interesting function in my opinion. as explained above it will basically allow users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

**STC Exchange**  
This function will provide the possibility to exchange the coins that will be launched using STC Terminal and also existing crypto or tokens.  
**STC DeFi / Stacking**  
I don’t have much information about this but they will provide some options for stacking or even participate in liquidity pools.

**STC Crowdfunding**  
Possibility to join crowdfunding in university-based startups or students.

**STC Wallet**  
The wallet is already available for download at App Store or Google Play. For now it’s an earlier version with no functions like exchange, deposit, withdraw.

**Tokens Coming soon in STC Platform**  
Oxford Student Token (OXF/STC)  
Melbourne Student Token (MLB/STC)  
STC LP Token (It seems to be for liquidity pools)

I looked at the different coins, having very little knowledge of any of them, even bitcoin. I decided to use my $2 to buy 0.0004 MKR, as I saw it had been rising recently. So now I hold 0.0004 MKR and I know nothing about it!

Browsing this sub and a few others it seems there's some responsibility that falls to MKR holders, voting on things or something? Is there something I need to be doing? I feel like maybe I don't hold enough to matter.

The MakerDAO governance community consists of two major components:   


* **On-chain Governance**
* **Off-chain Governance**

While On-chain Governance takes place via the [Portal](https://vote.makerdao.com/), Off-chain Governance happens in the [MakerDAO forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/). It’s a place where everyone can come discuss, ask questions, and have their voice heard. 

**It’s fundamentally possible to influence MakerDAO’s expertise-driven decision-making processes without holding any MKR.**

As part of the efforts to further better governance participation, the DAO has enabled an incentive mechanism to reward forum contributions, called SourceCred. As a consequence, you don’t need MKR tokens to both positively influence Maker Governance and be financially rewarded for doing so.

In short, you can get DAI rewards for forum contributions appreciated by other members.

**If that sounds interesting, head** [**here**](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/what-is-sourcecred-and-how-do-i-opt-in/3913) **to find all of the necessary resources, including on how to opt in and start receiving rewards.**

My question: in case the lender defaults, and the DAO remains with the real-world-assest, how is the DAO going to liquidate this assest? A real assest rests on legal frameworks. It also requires physical actions.

I used [https://defiexplore.com/liquidations](https://defiexplore.com/liquidations) to bid on a 50,000 Dai auction for 23 eth. When I connected clicked bid (with metamask wallet connected), the system said ""insufficient Dai"" even though the same system showed that I have ""50,000 DAI unused from previous bids. It will be used for future bids. You can withdraw it any time"". What do you think the problem is and any suggestions? Thanks."

I am a part-time Day Trader and this year, I have been trading BTC primarily and so far, I have been outperforming BTC by day trading. Now, day trading involves a lot more risk and requires a lot more time, but for me personally it has been working out well so far.

Since I am sitting at home A LOT during these Covid19 times here in Sweden, I decided to start a YouTube channel where I record all of my trades that I am doing on BTC and other cryptocurrencies.

Earlier this year, I started a Day Trading Challenge on my channel where I will try to grow 100 USD into 80k USD in 2021.

First of all, I want to make it clear that i HODL Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, so please dont hate on me for day trading as well. I both HODL, swing trade and day trade because I enjoy all of it. But 99% of my money is in HODL, ok?

But aside from the HODL portfolio, I am also doing day trading and swing trading because its fun and I am actually profitable in day trading as well. Right now, I am doing a day trading challenge on YouTube where I will try to 800X my money this year.

I started with 100 USD, then I lost a lot and went down to 18 USD (LOL)... But then I turned that 18 USD to 1369 after a small adjustment in my strategy, thats 76X the money. And I will keep doing this and hopefully I can reach my goal at 800X this year.

I am recording every single trade that I am doing and showing it on Youtube.

If crypto prices are going down, and the dollar is also going down but at a slower rate, is that what makes it a safer haven?

If the investment strategy is to HODL forever, what are the benefits of swapping to a stablecoin?

My favourite trading strategy (aside from HODL),https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/myaho8/my_favourite_trading_strategy_aside_from_hodl/,JoelOnCrypto,1,2021-04-25 23:25:02,1,/r/MakerDAO/comments/myaho8/my_favourite_trading_strategy_aside_from_hodl/,NaN,"Hey! I found a trading strategy that I really like and I am finally profitable with so I wanted to share it with you guys. But first, I want to make it clear that my #1 strategy is to HODL. But since HODL is 100% passive, I want to trade Bitcoin and other cryptos as well. Because I enjoy it, and its profitable for me.

So, my favourite day trading strategy is this:
- Taking profit at 3%
- Having a stop loss at 2%
- Using a 15X leverage (this is risky, so do NOT copy me)
- Using an exchange with super low fees
- Trading primarily Fibonacci golden pocket on smaller time frames

In my +80000% day trading challenge that I am doing on YouTube, I was able to 10X my balance in 2 months. I started with 100 USD and now it is over 1000 USD.

**About**

HIPS Payment Group Ltd. is a provider of innovative and cost-effective e-commerce and mobile payment solutions. Built on cutting-edge technology, Hips is disrupting the finance industry with its Payment gateway for Point of Sale, e-commerce, and m-commerce, a fully integrated, digital financial commerce platform with full reconciliation and financing support.

HIPS Merchant Protocol (HMP), the Hips Merchant Protocol Gateway (HMP-gateway) and the governing Merchant Token (MTO) is a solution that introduces consumer protection concepts from the traditional card payment industry to any blockchain with support for smart contracts like Ethereum, Cardano (ADA) or Solana, which we believe is the missing piece for crypto payments to have a market penetration and acceptance among mainstream consumers.

HIPS Merchant Blockchain is the native blockchain for HMP and Merchant Coin (MEO), optimized for real-time Merchant transactions created for Payment Service Providers (PSP) and EFTPOS devices with full support for backward compatible financial protocols like ISO8583 enabling crypto payments in standard terminal messages, using the existing terminal, and card scheme infrastructures for crypto payments in Hips Merchant Blockchain.

When it comes to my ETH stack, I am risk averse, so I am looking for a liquidation ratio of about 400%, which should give me ample time add more collateral, in case there is a downturn in ETH prices. 

What I am not sure about is how the liquidation engine works and if sudden spikes in the DAI price could cause a liquidation, with my proposed liquidation ratio.

What would happen, mechanically, if there was a spike in demand for DAI?

What would happen in the DAI market, the ETH market, and the MKR market?   What would happen to the stability fee?   How fast could MKR owners react?  Presumably the DAI savings rate would drop. But how?  Anything along these lines would be helpful.

Yesterday it was just slightly more than one million DAI from the goal with an estimated eta of 4 days.

Now it is more than 30 days to go and 4,7 million DAI from goal.

I thought first that the limit was stretched a bit for some reason, but it seams that the goal is still 30 million DAI and I am almost sure it was the same sins some weeks ago when I first saw this buffer.

Can someone who has better understanding than me explain the purpose of this buffer and what I just witnessed? Or at least point in a direction where I can find an explanation.

Seems like either way they are being removed from circulation so wouldn't it have the same effect?"

But why is it so complicated?

Could DAI be simplified to a smart contract that receives ETH, locks it, and then just mints and gives DAI amount based on ETH/USD price from an oracle? It could also receive DAI, burn it and pay back ETH from its locked pool.

Would that work and have the same benefits as the current DAI setup or do I miss something?"

I invested on this project in the start of this month on  phase 5 and i got impressed how quick the ICO is going, currently it's   on phase 76 of 100 and the ICO that was schedule for end at 30 June   probably will end much earlier them expected! The current price is $0.95  and it will be listed for $1.20 on Uniswap when the ICO is over.  Check   the whitepapper on the website and i hope you like it!

Website / launchpad: [https://merchanttoken.org/](https://merchanttoken.org/?ref=T4JQJ9Y49)

Another  interesting info, they already signed an partnership with The Payment House, an company that provide payment solutions for over 10.000 taxis  in UK and 20.000 in Scandinavia.

Surplus Auction,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/n0vxno/surplus_auction/,ZenComanche,1,2021-04-29 11:34:07,10,/r/MakerDAO/comments/n0vxno/surplus_auction/,NaN,"I cannot get my head around how the stability fees work and how they connect to surplus auctions.  

Do I have this right?

I stake ETH and I borrow DAI.  So, I now own as much DAI as I've borrowed.  

As a borrower of DAI, my ""interest rate"" is the stability fee.  This fee accumulates as a calculation.  

I only pay the fee in the form of more DAI than I borrowed.  So if I borrowed 100 DAI, and the Stability Fee is 5.5%, I will pay back roughly 105.5 DAI at the end of a year.   The vault gets 100 DAI, and 5.5 DAI got to the Surplus Buffer.

When the Surplus Buffer exceeds that amount, any additional Dai is auctioned off for MKR, and the MKR are burned.  


How'd I do?"

The thing is, I transfered some DAO to my metawallet, but the only thing that I can stake that money is in the DAO pool. For the APY of 7% or so, but I don't think this gives me any rewards? Is there a minimum amount that I have to stake there? Or simply no projects are being incubated right now?"

But there are also other wallets/pools that will credit interest on dai? Is there a good resource that has a collection of those rates?"
