**Earnings would be way over $260 if the Crypto Market wouldn't had a 30% drop...**

First of all:  
Please stay friendly. This post is supposed to show people, who don't have a regular income a way to grab some crypto for free. This page (obviously) won't get you rich. It's supposed to give you a start without a risk of loosing money.

I spent less than 30min per day on this page and was watching Netflix with it.

Here is my full proof of all my earnings and payouts: [https://imgur.com/a/IpkT5qa](https://imgur.com/a/IpkT5qa)  
I exchanged my payouts afterwards into my desired Coins to safe some fees.

DutchyCorp let's you do tasks and surveys where you get awarded Dutchy Coins. With these coins you are able to let a Faucet running and get paid in about 50 coins. Payouts to your Coinbase Account are without fees.  
How are you able to earn so much on DutchyCorp:  
\- Do the Coin Rolls and Dutchy Rolls for daily Bonus  
\- Run the Autofaucet on weekend with 20% claim Bonus  
\- Do Surveys on Offerwall to be able to earn more DUTCHY and increase your own level  
\- be active to get some free Coins by the RainBot  
\- Go to the Shortwall and click on the pages on a daily base  
\- Run the AutoFaucet with Balance Mode for additional 10%"

Yesterday I registered a Coinbase account and in the ‘earn rewards’ section earned £6.07 (0.02963014 COMP). I still need to learn more about the fees involved with COMP so have no immediate plans for it but was wondering what advice you would have on what to do with such a small amount?

Many thanks"

I'm new to the Compound community, but I'm absolutely stunned by how powerful DeFi is.

I have my ETH and Uni collateral locked on Compound, and have taken out a USDT loan (currently @ 50% of my borrowing limit). With the currently level of market volatility, I am naturally worried I might wake up one day and find myself liquidated. This could happen overnight, or if I'm at work and am unable to view my position status from my work computer.

TLDR: Is there an easy way to keep an eye on my position, without having to connect Metamask through my home computer? Not knowing how the current market volatility impacts my position is a bit concerning. You get it. :)

Thanks!"
