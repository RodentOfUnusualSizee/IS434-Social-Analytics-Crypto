Stocks Versus Crypto - An Analysis with 4 portfolios (Update 2),https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ovmc1q/stocks_versus_crypto_an_analysis_with_4/,FrogsDoBeCool,1,2021-08-01 13:20:02,27,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ovmc1q/stocks_versus_crypto_an_analysis_with_4/,METRICS,"About 1 month ago I made a post with 4 portfolios I made that include an ETF fund, a technology portfolio, Wall street bets insane stupid shit, and a crypto portfolio. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Allocated money \(Started may 1st, 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/hkswm9sujoe71.png?width=913&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77968554be0432dbbf552ab015aab04d8ddd3c5f)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

here are the results

&amp;#x200B;

[totals - raw data](https://preview.redd.it/9gw6z2v2koe71.png?width=477&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bad0cb817dc24cd8ddbe6aa1ba927a6599052deb)

&amp;#x200B;

what does the red / green mean? basically whoever has the most money is green, whoever has the least, red. 

&amp;#x200B;

[totals](https://preview.redd.it/fudiebw8koe71.png?width=695&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=321e711bf33ddd59da885300a9f955480ecd3665)

&amp;#x200B;

We see the wall street bets portfolio despite its initial hype has bottomed out at 75k\~. Crypto is recovering, and the technology portfolio basically does what the etf fund does but better.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[individual portfolios](https://preview.redd.it/3c2uk1kckoe71.png?width=1526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9a39d27bff8445eb46a26f7b9c63fbcb3b0ab45)

&amp;#x200B;

look at that vertical graph on the wsb portfolio god damn. The tech portfolio slowly moves up, the etf portfolio doesn't do much, although it is in a profit. the crypto portfolio is making a slow V curve, more like a U curve honestly. Maybe for the hopium guys out there we should call the crypto market a U curve. 

&amp;#x200B;

[overall profits](https://preview.redd.it/kdds503hkoe71.png?width=544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb095d3f223d1a469c3df36c6fb3d11adb41f8d4)

since may we have had a profit of about 20k from an original investment of 200k. 10% profit in 3 months, or about 40% a year. That's pretty good but we need to remember how skewed our profits are still from the WSB portfolio (assuming it doesn't go back up). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[total wealth](https://preview.redd.it/5q27nv5mkoe71.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b9b710e0ef26590ab03bf3208e1ad0a1243d953)

the crash of the crypto market was originally our reason why the totals went from 205k\~ to 190k. Which is a lot less of a drop than I expected. the WSB portfolio literally moved the entire portfolio until recently, when the crypto portfolio finally reversed the volatility of WSB, giving us a profit again for this last week!

&amp;#x200B;

 Please don't take these statistics with any financial background, specifically investing in what Wall street bets invests into. as a disclaimer: I added the WSB portfolio mostly as a joke, thinking the value would halve already... Let me know if I missed anything and what I should add for next month. (can't add alts, I use google finance they let me scrap data from btc, eth, and like ltc? i don't like ltc so lol)"

**DEFI Interfaces**

The main two defi interfaces are Zapper and Zerion. These help to remember all your degen things that you'll probably start doing after a few weeks/months of research:

[Zerion](https://app.zerion.io/)

[Zapper](https://zapper.fi/de)

Both of them are quite similar, easy to use and they started their own NFT projects recently.

**Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)**

There are a ton of decentralized exchanges, the most known is of course Uniswap. But don't miss out on the others as they all have their own interesting ideas. For example Sushi allows their tokenholders to earn a part of their revenue and Bancor has one-sides liquidity providing.

[Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)

[Sushi](https://sushi.com/)

[Bancor](https://bancor.network/)

[balancer](https://balancer.fi/)

DEX Aggregators

Matcha and 1inch try to find you the best prices accros the whole DEX spectrum. Compare the gas prices first tho.

[Matcha](https://matcha.xyz/)

[1inch](https://1inch.io/)

**Lending protocols**

The market leader for lending protocols is undoubted the Aave protocol. But there are other protocols like Alchemix which has self repaying loans, Curve or YearnFinance.

[Aave](https://app.aave.com/markets)

[Alchemix](https://app.alchemix.fi/)

[Curve](https://curve.fi/)

[Yearn Finance](https://yearn.finance/)

**Decentralized Insurance**

This is maybe a topic for the next bullrun in a few years. I wrote a small thread about it a few days ago:

**Tools**

To round it up there are a few tool that you just don't want to miss. If you're not a compleate beginner you'll know these for sure but I thought I'd add them anyways... Coingecko is on the way to take the market lead from coinmarket cap and Etherscan is just THE one tool you'll need for DEFI.

Many of the tokens in the top 200 are  Erc-20 tokens that don’t have official wallets and Metamask is predominately used as the utility wallet application. I didn’t list all of those. 

___
 

Many coins and tokens have wallet applications that have been specifically designed to allow you to better utilize your crypto and/or help support the native blockchain or the project you’re invested in. 

In some cases, multi asset wallets may be the best or only option. Many in the top 100 are supported by multi asset wallets and that’s easily searchable.


This is not a complete list of every wallet. This is a list of the most recommended wallets, most popular, and official or crypto specific wallets where applicable and excludes stable and wrapped coins and most well known multi asset wallets like Exodus, Atomic, Coinomi, Guarda, etc. as these together support almost every crypto in the top 200 and are not specifically designed for utilization of a single coin or blockchain. 

Please let me know if I made any mistakes or if additions are needed.

 Cardano (ADA)

Cardano, similar to Ethereum, is a smart contract platform committed to becoming a new generation of lower-level basic public chains that are more convenient, faster and smarter, and completely open-source. The founder, Charles Hoskinson was also one of the co-founders of Ethereum. At present, the development progress of Cardano is a smart contract platform, which is called the first blockchain project “driven by scientific philosophy and research”, and its development team is composed of a large number of expert engineers and researchers from around the world. Cardano adopts PoS consensus mechanism that does not require mining and an Ouroboros consensus algorithm.

There are three main official participants in the Cardano project: the Cardano Foundation, Cardano’scommercial incubation company Emurgo and the technology development company IOHK. The Cardano Foundation will promote Cardano to a broader community, popularize cryptocurrency knowledge, and excel in regulatory communication. IOHK is the engineering and code development organization behind Cardano technology. Emurgo is committed to integrating the platform with businesses.

**Cardano Foundation**

Cardano is operated by a non-profit company called the Cardano Foundation. The foundation provides multiple development directions for Cardano and the whole blockchain business. They are committed to extend Cardano to wider communities, popularizing cryptocurrency, and communicate with the government for supervision. The foundation provides a standard framework to promote cooperation between enterprises. The service is similar to the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) of the Ethereum network and NEO’s partner Onchain. Even though it is not a non-profit organization, it can also connect the public blockchain with the government and enterprises. Blockchain platforms such as NEO, ETH and Cardano are distributed. They provide a centralized publishing organization for enterprises, just like the publishing house of the platform.

**Input Output Hong Kong（IOHK） (Technical Support)**

IOHK is an academic institution that provides solutions for enterprises and governments to develop blockchains. The agency is led by Charles Hoskins and Jeremy wood, former CEO and executive assistant of ETH.

Among the three institutions behind ADA, IOHK is the most relevant entity of the project, led by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood. Charles first co-founded Invictus Innovations company, which issued BitShares, and then moved to Ethereum as the CEO! At present, he is the CEO of IOHK! Jeremy used to be an executive assistant of Ethereum. He also worked as a CSO in IOHK for nearly three years.

IOHK supports Cardano and has 17 research teams. These teams have been responsible for the development of Cardano’s technology and digital wallet. IOHK also supports other blockchain projects, including Ethereum Classic.

**Emurgo**

Emurgo, based in Japan, helps existing enterprises and invests in related industries by integrating blockchain technology to connect businesses to the Cardano blockchain. IOHK, Cardano Foundation and Emurgo have a clear division of labor and are associated with each other.

**Layered Technology**

In short, the information that Bitcoin can support is general value transfer data, such as the transfer parties, transfer time and transfer amount. Ethereum, the second generation blockchain, supports more information, such as transfer conditions, reasons, entities involved, etc., which are metadata. Ethereum refers to the connection between actual value transfer and associated metadata as smart contracts, which are programmable contracts.

However, for Ethereum, since there is no separation between settlement and calculation, these information is stored together, regardless of whether metadata needs to be included all the time. The more data in each transaction, the higher the cost, and the more difficult it is for the blockchain to store the information.

Cardano separates transfer and information \\. They separate the platform by dividing it into two different layers:

Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL): It is responsible for the token economy and the balance of all user accounts. Cardano’s native token ADA trades through this layer.

Cardano Computation Layer (CCL): Smart contract functions are in this layer and support regulatory elements such as digital identity.

The block reward will be issued every 3.5 minutes. The distribution frequency is as follows: initially, 2,000 ADA tokens will be generated for each block, with a total of 37,44,961 blocks; In the second stage, each block produces 1000 ADA tokens, totaling 37,44,961 blocks; In the third stage, each block produced 500 ADA coins, a total of 37,44,961 blocks. By analogy, it will take about 24 years to halve each block of 37,44,961 and produce three blocks per minute until all of them are released. 75% of the ADA coins generated in each block are used as the reward of the holders, and 25% are used as the reward for technology development and ecosystem builders after the project is launched. As long as users participate in the R &amp; D and development of Cardano application, they may be rewarded.

**Development Roadmap**

According to Cardano roadmap, the development stages of Cardano network mainly include the following five stages:

Byron: The guidance phase allows users to trade and transfer ADA tokens.

Shelly: The decentralized stage where it becomes a completely decentralized network.

Goguen: Develop and integrate the smart contract platform in the smart contract stage. (**Will be launched soon)**

Basho: The scalability phase where the smart contract is improved to increase performance, security and scalability.

Voltaire: The governance stage where IOHK introduces a financial system and governance to ensure the long-term development of communities and projects.

# Tokenomics

**Token: ADA** (ADA is named after Augusta Ada King-Noel: A mathematician in the 19th Century, who was recognized at the first computer programmer and the daughter of a poet named Byron)

**Total: 45 billion tokens（Ranked 5th for current market value）**

Current circulation: 32,066,390,668tokens（Data sourced from CoinGecko on August 2）

**Partial Ecosystem Projects**

**IDO Platform**

**CardStarter**

**Token: CARDS**

CardStarter was launched on March 29, with a focus on becoming the Launchpad and incubator of the Cardano network. It is planned to introduce a decentralized trading platform and AMM, namely CardSwap, in the third quarter. CardStarter sets up a hierarchical system through its token CARD, and token holders obtain the corresponding proportion of investment quota according to the amount pledged.

At present, CardStarter is deployed on Ethereum, and then migrated after the smart contract platform is deployed in Cardano. At the same time, CardStarter stated that all projects supported by CardStarter are ready to be launched on Cardano’s website.

**Occam.fi**

**Token: OCC**

Occam.fi is the smart DeFi layer under the Cardano ecosystem. It is mainly composed of three components: Launchpad platform OccamRazer, decentralized exchange OccamX and governance layer OccamDAO, OccamRazer as the main component.

Occam.fi has deployed OccamRazer on Ethereum in mid-April and will deploy OccamX and OccamRazer to the Cardano mainnet. OccamRazer allows the project to raise funds in various ways, including fixed-price mechanism, dynamic rise or fall mechanism, IDO joint curve mechanism, auction, etc. Besides, it also sets up a hierarchical system for users participating in IDO according to the amount of OCC staked.

**TrustPad**

**Token: TPAD**

Trustpad is a decentralized multichain IDO platform, including supporting coin security smart chains, Ethereum, Solana and Cardano. It aims to help project parties to raise funds and help early investors screen relatively safe investment opportunities.

**DEX and Liquidity Protocol**

**Adax**

**Token: ADAX**

Adax aims to become a DeFi solution in the Cardano ecosystem. It will introduce a DEX protocol that can provide token exchange and NFT transaction functions. Among them, the DEX protocol will be based on the AMM model. Adax plans to officially launch its platform after the launch of Cardano smart contract in the third quarter of this year, integrate IOHK ERC20 bridge and support cross-chain in the first quarter of next year.

**deFIRE**

**Token: CWAP**

deFIRE is a DeFi platform designed for the Cardano ecosystem. It provides execution services and order routing services for DEX token transactions and provides intermediary services between order flow initiators (such as wallets) and final execution platforms (such as DEX).

**DeFinity Network**

**Token: DEFX**

DeFinity Network is jointly launched by DMALINK, a foreign exchange dealer, and WeOwn, a technology company focusing on blockchain services. It claims to be a decentralized trading solution suitable for foreign exchange market, digital currency and central bank digital currency. DeFinity uses existing frameworks (including WeOwn, Ethereum, Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain BSC and Cardano) to build a decentralized ecosystem with interoperability. IDO was previously conducted on CardStarter and Occam. According to the roadmap, the project will launch its DEX platform in 2022.

**Orion Protocol**

**Token: ORN**

Orion Protocol is a liquidity aggregation protocol that will aggregate each CEX, DEX and exchange pools into a decentralized trading platform. It is committed to find solutions to the fragmentation of assets in the cryptocurrency market, NFTs market and traditional finance and gather them into one place.

Orion Protocol and Cardano development company IOHK reached cooperation in April this year and will become Cardano’s liquidity aggregator.

**NFT**

**ADAZOO**

**NFT Token: LACIE**

**Virtual Land Token: LAND**

ADAZOO hopes to build an NFT game based on Cardano, with its NFT collection, LACIE. Users holding LACIE are eligible to participate in the game. Players can get more LACIE rewards and continuously upgrade their roles during the game. In addition, players can also buy the virtual land token, LAND, and LAND holders can earn income from each transaction in their territory. ADAZOO aims to be one of the first NFT-based games running on the Cardano blockchain.

**Bondly**

Huobi Study Club: BSV was attacked twice by double spending in one month,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuobiStudyClub/comments/oxt0po/huobi_study_club_bsv_was_attacked_twice_by_double/,Born-Spread-2064,1,2021-08-04 21:46:22,0,/r/HuobiStudyClub/comments/oxt0po/huobi_study_club_bsv_was_attacked_twice_by_double/,NaN,"Huobi Observation

August 4, early morning, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has reportedly suffered a “massive” 51% attack resulting in up to three versions of the chain being mined simultaneously. Affected by this, Coinbase has halted all trading on BSV.

According to the report, after an attempted attack yesterday, some attackers with strong computing power launched another attack and succeeded. For more than 3 hours, the attackers took control of the entire blockchain, all exchanges that received BSV deposits during that time might have been double spent.

This is the second double spend attack on BSV in a month. On July 8, the BSV network suffered a malicious attack in which attackers repeatedly reorganized blocks on the BSV and used it to double spend.

According to Huobi Study Club, a double spend refers to the same digital currency being fraudulently spent more than once. Cryptocurrencies generally cannot be double-spent, but there are specific types of double-spending attacks that allow misbehavers to ""reverse"" crypto transactions, including Finney attacks, racial attacks and 51% attacks.

Without a proper mechanism, the double-spending problem cannot be completely solved only by virtue of the protocol, and users cannot verify that the funds they receive are not being paid elsewhere at the same time.

BSV had recorded a double-spending attack video in 2018, which was dismissed as rumor at the time. But now, there is more for BSV to consider, not only the technology improvement, but also the revival of market confidence.

Farm Tokenomics - real or perceived value?,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/oy7je4/farm_tokenomics_real_or_perceived_value/,Immediate_Ruin_,1,2021-08-05 09:48:37,13,/r/defi/comments/oy7je4/farm_tokenomics_real_or_perceived_value/,NaN,"*Tl:dr:*
I flip between believing and not believing in the value of yield aggregator governance tokens. Help me firm up my view. 

I’ve previously used:
- Autofarm
- Pancake bunny
- Harvest finance 
- Curve
- Pancakeswap
- Aave 
- etc

Whilst each platform has different Tokenomics, the general theme of taking 30% of the profit to mint a native token as an economic reward tends to confused me. 

1: Where does the 30% of the hypothetical “LP” token actually go?
2: What drives it’s value - it seems only the ability to vote and influence platform decisions. 

The best example is people who buy Cake to farm more Cake, or the erratic nature of a Sushiswap token price. 

One minute I believe in it and understand it - the next I feel like maybe I’m in a scam.

I know that this may have been asked before. I've been searching through the different posts here in this sub and I have asked in the telegram group as well. No one seems to directly answer the question I want to ask.  


So, what I did was stake my ETH on Lido to get stETH. After this, I added my stETH to the ETH-stETH pool in Curve and got crvstETH. After this, I placed my crvstETH on Yearn Finance. Seems like the easiest most logical thing to do I'm assuming.  


Now, my question is, am I still getting fees from Lido and Curve even if I have placed my assets on crvstETH?

## What Is Cryptocurrency?

A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.

### KEY TAKEAWAYS

* A cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers. This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control of governments and central authorities.
* The word “cryptocurrency” is derived from the encryption techniques which are used to secure the network.
* Blockchains, which are organizational methods for ensuring the integrity of transactional data, is an essential component of many cryptocurrencies.
* Many experts believe that blockchain and related technology will disrupt many industries, including finance and law. 
* Cryptocurrencies face criticism for a number of reasons, including their use for illegal activities, exchange rate volatility, and vulnerabilities of the infrastructure underlying them. However, they also have been praised for their portability, divisibility, inflation resistance, and transparency.

### Understanding Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are systems that allow for secure payments online which are denominated in terms of virtual ""tokens,"" which are represented by ledger entries internal to the system. ""Crypto"" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.

It was over an hour commute with a base pay of 12.50 + tips, which I decided wasn't worth the hassle anymore. My girlfriend is currently paying the bills (which are very low for my area thankfully) so I'm motivated to get my life together. This is the first time since the virus hit that I nailed an interview in my career field and was offered a position. I don't have much professional experience besides a year long internship at a major energy company and some personal experience with digital marketing (use to have a photography side business). I have a degree in marketing and a minor in economics. 

I interviewed for a position as a content coordinator at a real estate investment trust that manages very luxurious apartments in major cities. The job seems pretty entry but pays 24 an hour (more than I ever have been paid before). It deals with everything I've learned in my digital marketing classes and things I've done during my internship &amp; photography business. I over prepared and apparently really connected and wow'ed the interviewer. 

I was emailed shortly thereafter to consider a price analyst position to which I have no experience with. She said with my knowledge and economics background I'd be a great fit and wants to interview for it.  It's salary and pays between $57,000 - $65,000. The job description is very intimidating and would experience a huge learning curve. I don't even remember much from my econ, finance, and accounting classes. Honestly I'm scared ill fail in this position or have them second guess my competency. The pay is extremely appetizing though and would be life and career changing. Should agree to this interview?

"I'm horrified, scared, and afraid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/ozv7mx/im_horrified_scared_and_afraid/,ExpiredEggplant,1,2021-08-07 23:22:02,13,/r/MalaysianPF/comments/ozv7mx/im_horrified_scared_and_afraid/,Stocks,"Going on Reddit, Lowyat, or even Youtube, it's inevitable I'll encounter some sort of content/threads/ad relating to the stock market. It's infuriating, but it's also scary how much people are talking about stocks and how little idea people know what's really going on. I can't stop but be reminded of what happened before, during, and after the 2000's dotcom crash; people were talking about their million-dollar paper gains left and right, the countless threads on what to buy on ragingbull and yahoo finance forums, and the IPO roulettes. The parallels between what happened back then and what's happening now is eerie similar and I definitely do not like that.

Popular trends come with bandwagoners, and bandwagoners come with ignorant people. Here I just want to address some of the concerns I have and some common misconceptions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Irrational exuberance**

""The bubble."" What bubble? Sure, the words coming from my mouth are rather anecdotal, so I would like to supplement them with facts.

Cyclically adjusted Price Earning ratio (CAPE), or known as the Shiller PE ratio, is a measurement of value for the entire market. Its formula is `Price/Average earnings for 10 years adjusted for inflation`. CAPE provides an excellent view into the valuation of the market as it accounts for noise and inflation.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/MULTPL\/SHILLER\_PE\_RATIO\_MONTH\/3NwUmQN8-Shiller-S-P500-P-E-Ratio\/](https://preview.redd.it/jpa0nzhc5yf71.png?width=2509&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d5a31d1625648dc928f49a776e1bf49b194026f)

At the time of writing this, CAPE has gone up to 37.86, that's 6.33 points or 16% away from it's peak in 2000! During the peak in the 1920's it was only 32.56! We've already surpassed the great depression!

To put it into perspective, 1/37.86=2.64% earnings yield, that means for every dollar invested in a firm it's only gonna return 2.64% of earnings back in one year! Assuming the firm has a 0% plow back ratio and gives out all its earnings as dividend, you're only gonna double your money in  Log₁.₀₂₆₄2=26.6 years without capital gains!

&amp;#x200B;

**The Ponzi scheme everybody's in**

""Dividends are for boomers!"" It's not that I would like to invalidate capital gains as a valid source of profit, but there's a point when investors become rational and decide that the price is too high to pay for. I'm not a clairvoyant so I can't tell you what the TP is, but it'll happen eventually. And when that happens, fresh capital will stop coming in and people will start panic selling. People often omit the fact that the entire stock market right now (and including the crypto markets) is akin to a Ponzi scheme; when people buy shares of a firm the only revenue source they strive for is when other people buy into it and they exit at a higher price (capital gain).

And what's scarier? Your money is in it as well, even if you personally didn't partake in any financial transactions. As of q4 2019, the market capitalization of EPF is US$226 billion, versus the market capitalization of Malaysia at US$436 billion, and that's not even including sovereign funds or government-linked funds like KWAP or PNB. So when you say it only hurts the rich, you're getting hurt as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Stock prices are up! The economy should be going up too, right?**

There is a frank discrepancy between reality and the numbers on a ticker, and I do believe everybody is familiar with your family folks saying something along the lines of ""Stock prices are up! But why is the economy still shit?""

Yet people keep forgetting the colloquial speak for stock prices usually refers to the various indices, and in this case, I'll use the Wilshire 5000 as an example. When W5K goes up, it refers to the market capitalization going up, not the productive output going up. The productive output is usually measured by GDP, and it's not going as high as W5K is going. The Buffett ratio is a common market valuation indicator to evaluate whether the market is overpriced or not, by dividing the market capitalization of W5K with the GDP. A simple google search will net you the results concluding that the market is insanely overpriced, standing at 236%, or in layman terms 2 dollars and 36 cents for per dollar of productive output. 

[https:\/\/www.currentmarketvaluation.com\/models\/buffett-indicator.php](https://preview.redd.it/o6zwblrimxf71.png?width=1532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de2637e937467183e4d58ea1e7c654b9b1bc376a)

Do keep in mind that the productive output includes firms that are not public hence if we were to restrict the productive output from only public firms it'll return an even higher ratio.

&amp;#x200B;

**But the GDP is still going up, isn't that good?**

Yes... and no. Yes, the GDP is going up by a healthy \~12% TTM since the start of the recovery but that isn't the whole story. 

Let's talk about inflation first, current inflation figures stand at \~5% as measured by the CPI yoy.

[https:\/\/tradingeconomics.com\/united-states\/consumer-price-index-cpi](https://preview.redd.it/45mtpx9noxf71.png?width=1276&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8376a3dbd72c54f01942b12de75e8799f4da4834)

Discounting the GDP, we'll still get 7% left, isn't that great?

[https:\/\/tradingeconomics.com\/united-states\/gdp-growth-annual](https://preview.redd.it/vs5lqllxoxf71.png?width=1267&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49cc9960fd418be0150415c5050e5f546b64f757)

No. The 12% derives from the surge of recovery from last year's recession. When things eventually settle down after the surge, the 12% figure won't be sustainable.

&amp;#x200B;

**The ugly truth**

But inflation is there to stay if the feds don't start raising interest rates soon.

Interest rates and inflation have an inverse relationship; when the feds lower the interest rates, inflation hikes will follow suit as everyone is motivated to spend more (like how people rush out to buy new houses and get new mortgages because interest rates are low, the sale of new houses prop up the GDP, and this is why the feds do it.) Currently, we're wiping the floors @ an interest rate of 0.25%, the lowest EVER in history, due to unprecedented amounts of OMOs and QEs by the feds. A quick glance over the feds balance sheet will tell you how ballooned it has become, to prop up the GDP.

[https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/WALCL](https://preview.redd.it/18r6n1u6dyf71.png?width=2033&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff0e4a5fff3674ef88b69b1380c8097e893304f4)

(On a balance sheet, asset always equals liability, but in this case, we'll just focus on the asset side for simplicity's sake.)

In order to inject liquidity into the slowing, dying markets of q2 2020 right after the first wave of covid hit, the feds had to print money by expanding their books and buying a ton of debt instruments. This monetary policy had the intended effect of reducing the interest rate - to a level where people will be motivated to spend, but it has its consequences as well. As more spending goes on, inflation will follow suit as resources get more and more scarce. And as we all know, stable inflation at 2-3% is good, anywhere other than those ballpark figures is bad. If current inflation rates at 5% persist without sustainable high GDP growth, we'll enter what's called the ""stagflation"" phase.

Stagflation in layman terms means high inflation combined with low economic growth, and this double whammy will have very real impacts on our lives - including the devaluation of currencies and high unemployment. There's an article done by Stashaway regarding the direction the economy is heading right now and it's a very intriguing read: [https://www.stashaway.my/r/economy-inflationary-disinflationary-growth](https://www.stashaway.my/r/economy-inflationary-disinflationary-growth)

&amp;#x200B;

**Honey, I popped the bubble!**

Then how to curb inflation? By raising interest rates! Inflation is caused by overheated spending, hence quantitative tightening will help to raise the interest rates. All fine and dandy? 

No. If we were to look way back, at the 2000's dot-com crash, one of the things that led to the bubble popping was Alan Greenspan, then Chair of the fed raising interest rates, and subsequently the overvalued markets crashed.

But why? 

Interest rates control how much consumers will spend, and from the perspective of an investor how much an investor will invest (or rather, speculate in this era). Drawing an example close to home, raising interest rates will raise margin rates for leverage traders, inhibiting their ability to trade and therefore limiting fresh capital into the market.

There's a phenomenon called the inverted yield curve out there, and it predicts or illustrates a recession. The principle of how it works is there are generally two yield curves on a graph, one 1-year and one 10-year yield curve for Treasury bonds. When the 1-year curve has a higher yield than the 10-year curve it means that investors rather hold onto the long-term bonds than the short-term ones because they're uncertain about what's to come next and would rather lock into their yields.

[https:\/\/www.gurufocus.com\/yield\_curve.php](https://preview.redd.it/86sbi0ju2yf71.png?width=1311&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50be5cbe49f70a911ca500736c5e2d8d7d301486)

At the end of 2019, there was an inversion and in March of 2020 the recession began, so there's no doubt about its accuracy.

Here comes the problem, if the feds were to raise rates, they have to raise them from the short term because they're basically on the floor right now.

[https:\/\/www.treasury.gov\/resource-center\/data-chart-center\/interest-rates\/Pages\/TextView.aspx?data=yield](https://preview.redd.it/x3pv9r6i3yf71.png?width=1364&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5744fedfbb1cc7526bad7514ce2e44acf31a6017)

And when that happens, the spread comes closer to inversion and therefore an inevitable recession."
Best Java frameworks for web development,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_STEPS_Kochi/comments/p0y1xu/best_java_frameworks_for_web_development/,STEPS_Kochi,1,2021-08-09 17:29:08,0,/r/u_STEPS_Kochi/comments/p0y1xu/best_java_frameworks_for_web_development/,NaN,"Java is the most widely used programming language. It is a strong  language that, when paired with a framework, can deliver the finest  solutions for every domain, including e-commerce, banking, cloud  computing, finance, big data, the stock market, information technology,  and more.

If you’re new to Java, check out this blog, which will walk you  through all the key ideas you’ll need to get started with the best  frameworks for web development.

Java is used by millions of websites, including some major companies  like Google, Amazon, LinkedIn, eBay, and Stack Overflow. There are  several Java frameworks available on the market, but none of them  provide a superior solution; as a result, industries prefer to select  the most appropriate and finest framework.

Most companies become confused while deciding on the best framework  for application development, and as a result, they are unable to make a  clear and effective selection.

## What Are Java Frameworks, and How Do They Work?

A Framework is a collection of pre-written code that functions as a  template or skeleton that a developer can use and reuse to create an  application by adding in their code as needed to get the app to perform  as desired. Developers may develop their apps without having to write  every line of code from the start by reusing frameworks.

&amp;#x200B;

Java frameworks

&amp;#x200B;

## Spring

* Spring is used by around 803 active websites, with a total of  8,821 sites utilizing it in the past. Spring is used by Google, Netflix,  Microsoft, and Amazon etc…
* Spring is a popular lightweight JAVA framework that is mostly used to build enterprise applications.
* This is an open-source framework with several features, such as security and configuration.
* Since the framework was first published in 2002, it has a growing community.

## Hibernate

* Regardless of the fact that Hibernate is not a full-stack framework, it completely transformed our approach to databases.
* Hibernate is an Object-Relational-Mapping (ORM) database for Java applications that implements the Java Persistence API (JPA).
* Hibernate queries are referred to as HQL, much as SQL queries (Hibernate Query Language).
* This framework that maps Java classes to database tables and vice versa.

## Structs

* Another solid open-source framework for web applications is Apache Struts.
* It extends the JSP API and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) model.
* If  a user submits a form with his information, the information is sent to a  servlet for processing, or the control is sent to the next JSP (Java  Server Pages – where you may write Java code in HTML) in a typical  servlet-JSP method.

## Grails

* Grails is an easy-to-learn full-stack framework that is ideal for programmers who are just getting started.
* While Grails is a web framework built in Groovy, it operates on the Java platform and is fully compatible with Java syntax.
* The MVC design pattern is used to build this framework.

## Hadoop

* It is not a full-stack framework by Apache.
* These tools  can readily manage large amounts of data (Big Data), store, analyze, and  process it, resulting in faster and more efficient outcomes.

## GWT

* Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is a Java framework built by Google for developing rich internet applications.
* One  of the most useful characteristics of GWT is that it transforms Java  code into JavaScript code, which is specialized code written for the  browser.
* This feature appeals to me since we used to spend a lot  of time and effort on browser testing during development. Many  additional Java frameworks, such as log4j for logging, JUnit, and  Selenium for testing, are not full-stack or web development frameworks  but are useful in any application. These are important to know, but you  can learn them on the fly along with the other frameworks listed above.

The best framework for your app should satisfy your business needs,  have a certain level of flexibility and performance, and be simple to  maintain and adapt to changes. If you want to learn about the  possibilities and updates more, a [java internship in Kochi ](https://www.stepskochi.com/)can help you improve your learning curve. We hope this post has been helpful to get a better understanding of Java. [Java online course in Kochi](https://www.stepskochi.com/java-training-kochi)  can help you to become a good Java web developer and know the basics  skills in Java programming that grab a successful career in Java."
Where do you earn interest on your stablecoins?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p15n9a/where_do_you_earn_interest_on_your_stablecoins/,brian2707,1,2021-08-10 01:05:04,11,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p15n9a/where_do_you_earn_interest_on_your_stablecoins/,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,"I have a large part of my savings in crypto. But, I'm not a total ape and do hold a lot of stablecoins. However, holding stablecoins in your wallet is a huge waste of capital because you can easily earn 5-40% interest on them. Where do you guys deposit your stablecoins, what yield are you getting, and what’s the reason for you using that platform over others?

On deciding where to deposit, I think most look for security. Reassuring places might be large CeDeFi entities like Celsius, BlockFi, or Coinbase, where you can earn 8.9%, 7.5%, and 4% interest, respectively. Next might be old-name DeFi platforms, like Aave (2%), Compound (4%), Yearn (8%), or Curve (8% in CRV rewards). But, Ethereum has high fees and Yearn has been exploited before.

Of all the protocols I’ve researched, I think Alpaca Finance on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) offers really high yields (20-50%), while still being secure and trusted. Even though BSC has a bad rep, Alpaca Finance is different. They are a blue-chip protocol and leader in leveraged yield farming across all DeFi chains They have $1.6B in TVL, 11 audits on their smart contracts, and developed many of their own security measures, such as time-locked contracts and an Oracle Guard. If you visit their [Docs](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/), you can see the sheer amount of information and transparency they provide. It’s much more than other protocols. From their well-designed user interface and NFT campaigns, you can see how serious they are about their product.

How does Alpaca give you such high interest rates? Leveraged yield farming of stablecoins. For example, if you open a USDT-BUSD leveraged yield farm and deposit $10k USDT, you can borrow up to $50k BUSD (6x leverage) and farm the combined total of $60k. It’s a little bit like Aave, where users deposit stablecoins, borrow stablecoins, and repeat, so they are essentially leveraged up on stablecoins while capturing all that yield. But, the difference is Alpaca Finance 1) does this in one easy step for you and 2) routes your stablecoins to providing liquidity on AMMs, which is more profitable than borrowing/lending (Aave, Compound). Thus, you can get 20-50% yields (right now it’s at 40%).

Anyway, let me know what you guys think. Feel free to ask me anything about leveraged farming or DeFi in general. I just want to spread the word that you can still profit by just holding stablecoins, no need to ape everything into crypto."

"Anyone discouraged by the price drop, remember the US Debt is completely unsustainable. This shows a full breakdown.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/p18vdq/anyone_discouraged_by_the_price_drop_remember_the/,exploring_finance,1,2021-08-10 03:43:21,69,/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/p18vdq/anyone_discouraged_by_the_price_drop_remember_the/,Due Diligence," This article first appeared on [SchiffGold](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/).

## Introduction

&gt;*“Just because something is inevitable, does not make it imminent, but eventually the future arrives”*

The US Government is on an unsustainable debt trajectory. Even though the Federal Reserve has acknowledged this fact, most mainstream figures consider it a distant problem or even not an issue at all. They argue that debt fears have raged since the debt crossed $1T decades ago and no negative consequences have materialized

This analysis shows why the US Government is at much greater risk than even a few years ago. It starts with a look at the recent numbers, then shows the debt rollover by product. A deeper look into history demonstrates the changing debt makeup that has created the increase risk for the Treasury.

## Current Trends

In the month of July, the government shrunk the total outstanding debt by 102B. This is the only decrease in the debt outstanding over 18 months. It did continue the trend of rolling short term Bills into medium term Notes.

With the debt ceiling limit expiring on July 31, it is strange the Treasury would not use the last month of the suspended ceiling (and rock bottom interest rates) as a way to increase its cash reserve.

*Non-Marketable consists almost entirely of debt the government owes to itself (e.g. debt owed to Social Security)*

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1: Month over month change in debt](https://preview.redd.it/1vlluwhzqdg71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2914d48ddbc7cbe77e25ca404472d57821a1cf3c)

 

In fact, looking at the Treasury cash balance tells a very interesting story. In last years debt binge, the Treasury built up enormous cash reserves. Suddenly, and very rapidly, the Treasury decided to draw down its cash reserve by over $1T.

Was this a plan to put downward pressure on interest rates to [help sell the narrative of transitory inflation](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/the-fed-in-a-box-part-2-they-cannot-end-quantitative-easing/)? Is it a political move to ensure the US Debt Ceiling limit debate cannot be dragged out for months? One thing is for sure when looking at the chart below, the Treasury wanted to get rid of its cash cushion as fast as possible.

Currently the treasury is projected to run out of cash by Oct or Nov. Any logical person who recognizes the Treasury had no debt limit would ask: why not juice the balance sheet and get the new limit as high as possible? The answer is most likely that Yellen and Biden want a resolution to the debt ceiling debate sooner rather than later. The sooner the Treasury runs out of cash, the sooner congress has to deal with the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 2: Treasury Cash Balance](https://preview.redd.it/4xivb4nohdg71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61b283d61e63b1ff2f8c80259a0b501b45f52d98)

 

#### DETAILED DEBT BREAKDOWN

The table below looks at the most recent month of debt issuance, compared to the previous month, and also the Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) average. More history is shown on the right comparing the last 3 TTM periods (the last 36 months). Some key takeaways:

* The treasury has averaged 159B of new debt over the last 12 months. July went the opposite direction in a big way (falling 101B).
   * The focus continues on allowing short term debt to mature while increasing longer term debt
   * Bills (&lt; 1 year) fell by 130B, with 1-3 year notes dropping 33B. Notes and Bonds increased by 140B.
* Looking at TTM values:
   * The Total T-Bill outstanding has fallen by 900B in the past year
   * Issuance of notes has skyrocketed, but primarily in 1-7 years:
      * 1-3 year more than doubled from 332B to 792B
      * 3-7 year almost tripled from 270B to 772B
      * Surprisingly, 7-10 was nearly flat, increasing only 10B
      * Bond (20+) issuance jumped 50% from 222B to 323B

The points above and the data below show the Treasury replacing very short term debt (&lt;1 year), with mostly medium term debt of 1-7 years. This does reduce the risk of rising interest rates some, but only for a short period. However, the Treasury seems to be moving away from this conversion in the coming months. It [recently stated](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-treasury-borrowing/u-s-treasury-keeps-auction-sizes-steady-mulls-future-cuts-idUSL1N2PA2GM) plans to reduce medium to long term debt issuance. Future funding crunches will be supported with short term debt issuance. Any increase in fiscal spending will immediately re-establish the short term debt risk that the Treasury has been strategically trying to reduce over the last year.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 3: Recent Debt Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/7bkbvkzqhdg71.png?width=2940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d64f552a83612455385a778b3f5f45d46d44468)

 

### Debt Rollover

While it may help that 23% of total US debt is owed to itself (Non Marketable), it still leaves a massive $22T to wrestle with. Another point of relief is the [$5T held by the fed](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/fed-balance-sheet-july-2021-143b-added/), which is an interest free loan (more on this below). Even with the $11T in interest free loans, the primary risk the government faces is not new debt issuance (it could just cut spending), but instead rolling over existing debt.

Rolling over debt is using new debt to pay back debt that is maturing. The chart below shows the amount of debt issued and matured going back 7 years. It also looks forward to see what is maturing in the future. As shown below, the majority of debt issued each month is actually rollover, with only a small percentage being new debt (red bar), which can even bring total debt down when more matures than is issued (on occasion such as this past month).

[ Figure 4: Monthly Rollover](https://preview.redd.it/s22tuujthdg71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e9e11c5f8ac100858c18807c82cf23e518b8fe9)

 

*Note “Net Change in Debt” is the difference between Debt Issued and Debt Matured. This means when positive it is part of Debt Issued and when negative it represents Debt Matured*

From 2012-2016 about $500B a month was rolling over (mostly short term as explained below). This started moving up in 2017, reaching $1T a month by 2020 before jumping to $1.5T as Covid hit. Another important factor is the red bar showing how much of the Issued debt is new debt, being added.

While it may look like the government is about to get relief with a lot of debt maturing in the coming months, most of the debt will be refinanced into short term debt and the rolling will continue at above $1.5T.

#### T-BILLS (&lt; 1 YEAR)

There is currently $4T outstanding in short term treasury bills, up more than double the amount 3 years ago. The Treasury tends to finance surges in spending with Treasury Bills because they are well accepted by the market. The plot below shows the [Bid to Cover](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bidtocoverratio.asp) ratio for short term T-Bills. A higher Bid-to-Cover indicates stronger demand. While demand is off from its peak during 2012-2015, a bid-to-cover above three is still strong. Especially considering how much more short term debt has been issued in recent years.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 5: T-Bill Bid to Cover](https://preview.redd.it/1lhkqeyvhdg71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84f6e6bde55baea081bd0fdf5fdef202ac520501)

 

While demand for T-Bills may be strong, it poses a risk to the Treasury. Each month almost 35% (1.5T) is rolling over, and as the chart below shows nearly 100% rolls over within a six-month window. This means any Fed hike will be felt almost instantly in the Treasury Bill market. Each .25% rate hike will translate to $10B a month in additional annual interest payments within 6 months.

As discussed above, the Treasury is making an effort to convert some of the Treasury Bills into Notes. If this effort is successful, the short term risk will decreases some; however, it may prove more challenging to restructure most of its short term debt, especially with all the new spending planned. Even if successful, it’s mostly rolling into 1-7 year debt which only provides some short term relief.

&amp;#x200B;

#### TREASURY NOTES (1-10 YEARS)

Although the Treasury talks about taking advantage of low interest rates to lock in expenses, it’s easier said than done. The plot below shows the bid to cover for 2 year and 10 year debt. Unlike Bills which range between 3-3.5, Notes are closer to 2.5. The Treasury cannot flood the market with new debt because there wouldn’t be enough demand and interest rates would be pushed up.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 7: 2 year and 10 year bid to cover](https://preview.redd.it/k6u5x3b0idg71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743a8fe6aefdf9eb4c40f3036200abe5f0d8cc17)

Notes also present their own problem. While rates do get locked in, the Treasury really only buys relief for a couple years. The chart below shows the annual rollover for Treasury Notes. As shown, the amount rolling over has picked up significantly in recent years even though net change in debt is still below the levels in 2008 and 2009.

2022 will be the largest year ever in Notes that need to be rolled over. This is just showing debt that already exists and needs to be refinanced. What also needs to be considered is the new spending and also the efforts to convert T-Bills into Notes as mentioned above.

Furthermore, the last red bar represents 2021 new debt through June. While the debt ceiling will halt new debt for the next few months, when the ceiling is raised, total Note issuance for 2021 could approach $4T (the light green bar of $1T+ still needs refinancing in 2021)! It will be important to watch this chart in the coming months to see how the Treasury handles Note issuance, especially with the debt ceiling coming into play.

#### INTEREST RATES

Finally, a look at interest rates shows how the Treasury has been able to maintain low interest payments despite a ballooning deficit. Rates have been declining for 20 years. The actions by the Fed to hold short term rates at 0% and also engage in Quantitative Easing have been critical for the Treasury to manage its debt load. Unfortunately, rates have come up against a floor at zero, so there may not be much room for either the Fed or Treasury to maneuver.

This is why [the Fed cannot raise rates](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/the-fed-in-a-box-part-1/) or even [taper QE](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/the-fed-in-a-box-part-2-they-cannot-end-quantitative-easing/) without significant ramifications.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 9: Interest Rates](https://preview.redd.it/p2xm9m75idg71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=629a64ab3b0db0d4d00a732c4d3d17ae925d1fa5)

Recently, the 10 year and 2 year rates have started moving back together. While there is still distance before the yields invert (as shown below), it is a trend to watch. Perhaps driving this convergence is the debt issuance by the Treasury over the last few months, focusing Note issuance at the shorter range rather (1-7yr) than the longer end (7-10yr) as shown in the tables above. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 10: Tracking Yield Curve Inversion](https://preview.redd.it/x661e2i7idg71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c2ddc31f63fba1f8c68e425214d97cfb495b61d)

## Historical Perspective

The loudest critics of the US Debt and Fed monetary policy will point to $28.5T in US Debt and quickly calculate that every .25% interest rate move costs the US $70B a year. The debt is a major problem, but the real story is much more complicated. It’s important to understand the makeup of the debt, maturity schedules, and current interest rates. To start, the chart below breaks down how the debt is organized by instrument.

There is $6T+ of Non-Marketable securities which are debt instruments that cannot be resold. The vast majority of Non-Marketable is money the government owes to itself. For example, Social Security holds over $2.8T in US Non-Marketable debt, almost half the total amount. This debt poses zero risk because any interest paid is the government paying itself.

The remaining $22T is broken down into Bills (&lt;1 year), Notes (1-10 years), Bonds (10+ years), and Other (e.g. TIPS).

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 11: Total Debt Outstanding](https://preview.redd.it/zk9teoz9idg71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78788eaf026dbb64ad05ccc03ae080d4ef3b6882)

The chart below shows how the distribution of debt has changed and what the impact has been on total interest. The amount of Non-Marketable as a percentage of total has shrunk significantly from 50% down below 25%. The spike in short term debt can also be seen in the last two recessions as the government used T-Bills to finance surges in spending.

#### HISTORICAL DEBT ISSUANCE ANALYSIS

Recent years have seen a lot of changes to the structure of the debt, with risk being brought forward up the yield curve as shown in the chart above. Looking at a longer historical period shows an even more stark picture of how dramatic the changes have been. This table explains why “it hasn’t been a problem for decades”, but refutes the notion that it can hold true going forward without *significant* and *continued* intervention by the Fed.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 13: Debt Details over 20 years](https://preview.redd.it/78t7n7jfidg71.png?width=1754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=284725b444753aae3c26d5c86fb54be5bfe80478)

 

It can take time to digest all the data above. Below are some main takeaways:

* Bills have increased from 620B to 4.1T over 20 years yet Annualized interest has fallen from 27.7 to 2.6
   * The impact of a .25% interest rate hike is up 7x from 1.6B to 10.4B
   * As recently as 3 years ago, annual interest on Bills was 36.7B, despite half the current size. Rates only reached 1.7%.
   * Returning to 4.5% on Bills from 20 years ago would cost the Government $180B a year!
   * Bills still make up 14.6% of the debt, up from 11.7% 20 years ago but down from 20% one year ago
* Notes made up 28% of total debt balance 20 years ago but has surged to 43%
   * 20 years ago 50% of debt was Nonmarketable (owed to itself - posing no risk), but that well has seemingly gone dry
   * Notes increased nearly 10 fold 1.4T to 12T, yet interest has only doubled 85B to 177.5B
   * If avg interest rate returned to 5.9% (up from today’s 1.46%), total annualized interest would clock in at $718B!
* Bond balances are also up 6x while interest is only up double (51B vs 101B)
* Avg maturity has been extended some increasing from 2.7 yrs to 3.5 in Notes and from 18 yrs to 21.8 in Bonds

## What it means for Gold and Silver

The Treasury is out of tricks. Interest rates have bottomed and the intra-government debt cannot keep up with debt issuance (not to mention at some point those bills will come due also - e.g. Social Security). While an increase in interest rates would take time to work its way through Notes and Bonds, the impact would be felt immediately in Bills. That being said, with Notes having an avg maturity of 3.5 years, it wouldn’t take long to feel the increase in Notes as well which would prove devastating given the balance size.

Thus the Fed cannot raise short term rates and it needs to keep long term rates contained. Given the amount of Notes to rollover in the years ahead, any effort to taper will be “transitory” at best. With the Fed forced to continue aggressive monetary policy indefinitely, it is almost certain inflation will prove much more persistent than the Fed is leading on. Other countries do not have the same risk/exposure as the Treasury which means the dollar could come under significant pressure as the Fed is unable to act to combat inflation while foreign central banks do. Gold and silver offer a great protection against a devaluing dollar in this environment.

#### A CRITICAL POINT

Not only does the Fed alleviate pressure on the Treasury by keeping interest rates low across the curve, but the debt the Fed buys equates to an interest free loan. Any interest the Fed receives from its balance sheet is returned back to the Treasury. “Only” [$5.2 of the $8T balance sheet is in Treasuries](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/fed-balance-sheet-july-2021-143b-added/), but it is almost all in Notes. While this does offer medium term protection, the Treasury is still exposed to short term rates. Furthermore, it also means the Fed will be unable to shrink its balance sheet or the medium term protection will be immediately lost. This should be considered when reviewing the information above and the impact of rising rates.

Apricot - The Next AAVE on Solana,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p1jlpl/apricot_the_next_aave_on_solana/,ethjude,1,2021-08-10 14:23:54,3,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p1jlpl/apricot_the_next_aave_on_solana/,NEW-COIN,"🌺Found Apricot from a reddit post. After doing some research, I have summarized some of the best parts of the project.

* Apricot Finance is the first DeFi project on Solana to do the lending-and-borrowing service.💰
* It will minimize the liquidation penalties unlike other traditional lending-and-borrowing projects such as AAVE, Curve.
* Any new features?🤔
* 🙋Orderbook-based fixed rate loans (unsure about the tech behind, still seeking for answer from their Discord)
* ✊Close to zero collateral loans (Keeping an eye on this! It will save a lot if it actually works!)
* A humongous and supportive community with over 25k members on their discord channel (Disclaimer: I am one of them)
* What makes Apricot so special? 🌻
* It has a very experienced team with over 20+ developers and managers in the team. They have spent over a year on this project by surviving through various market conditions and overcoming many obstacles. They are working actively on new features to push the project one step ahead of other borrowing-and-lending projects.

🚧That's about it! Hope this article helps you in your search for a stable DeFi project to work with.

\## Disclaimer: The purpose of this post is not to pick on AAVE or Curve. This post was purely my personal opinion about the environment and some macro observations, and I do apologize if it offends anyone at all! :) 💙"

I have been working in IT as an infrastructure engineer for about 15 years now and I'm totally getting burned out working for corporations and being a small cog in the machine. I would love to find a job for a financial firm or something maintaining infrastructure and also possibly doing some work on the quant side. 

I've been actively trading futures and equities for 6 years and I'm currently trying to move all of my operations to a fully systematic model. I am currently working with TradeStation/Easylanguage but I'm also learning Python in my spare time and learning how to develop with Zipline-Trader and LEAN frameworks. I love coming up with trading ideas and testing them. I do also understand the pitfalls of backtesting and curve fitting etc. I've considered obtaining my CTA or RIA designation, as well.

IT Skills:  Windows/Linux servers and many popular services/stacks, VMware/hyper-v, docker/kubernetes, enterprise hardware infrastructure; disk arrays, servers, network switching, phone systems, hyperconverged etc. O365, AWS/Azure.  I possess high level troubleshooting skills and I love figuring out problems and implementing high level solutions.   


I realize this is a real long shot, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to throw it out there and I would absolutely LOVE to pivot my career to find a job working in finance!"

They are usually finance/business majors, which is easy(i have a bs in engineering from top college in my country) but engineers have high gpa too. People who have gpa less than 3.3 are almost perceived as idiots. Here in my country, it is really difficult to have that kind of grades. They really challenge us with difficult exams and overlapping excess assignments Our classes are usually curved and curve grade is usually around 50/100. Is classes really easy in US or am i missing something?

 1. Antonio - AMA Co-ordinator
 1. Danish Chaudhry - CEO of Bitcoin.com

##Starting Questions:

Question 1:

* Antonio, [11.08.21 02:02]
``To the Ergo team: What are your thoughts on blockchain adoption and what can Ergo do to continue to make this technology more accessible to the mainstream public?``

Answer: 

* kushti khushi, [11.08.21 02:03]
 * Ergo community is making a lot of efforts to clarify things around the cryptocurrencies. Please refer to Ergo Manifesto. Still, first principles matter!

* kushti khushi, [11.08.21 02:05]
 * From technical perpective, the protocol is already capable for different known efficient on-chain scalability, offchain, and cross-chain solutions

* Glasgow, [11.08.21 02:05]
 * Ergo has been focused on building a concrete base these past years and build up solid foundations and financial tooling for the people. We strive to make Ergo more accessible each day and utilise our community in full to do this. Just this past week a community member has been organising a ‘Women in Crypto’ group to bring more women into the scene. And the Local Exchange Trading System (collective bartering) will certainly help there imo! 

 * More concretly, iteratively building up our tooling and systems to be usable and friendly to anyone and while giving them financial autonomy.

* Armeanio, [11.08.21 02:06]
 * Blockchain is an evolving technology. Personally, I think there are three areas that need development to push the development curve. 

 * The first is practical use cases for the common person. In Defi especially we need to position ourselves to produce functional tools at a lower cost than the traditional finance community. 

 * The second is user-friendly development tools and educational resources, I do think a part of this will be solved simply due to the technical capacity of younger generations. As building and interacting with blockchain becomes a widely adopted skill set I think we will see an influx of developers. 

 * The third is user-friendliness. User interfaces are always extremely important.

* Antonio, [11.08.21 02:07]
 * Great, and it seems like y'all are shining quite a bit in the sphere as of late, that's for sure!

Question 2:

* Antonio, [11.08.21 02:07]
``To Danish: What in your opinion makes Ergo’s smart contracts different?``

Answer: 

* Armeanio, [11.08.21 02:08]
 * Personally, I am a fan of the concept of multistage contracts due to the lower cost/ computational processing involved since much of the logic runs off-chain. This aligns well with the first adoption goal mentioned above. It is cost-competitive.

* Danish Chaudhry, [11.08.21 02:09]
 * [In reply to Antonio]
 * Ergo has many differentiators which make it shine amongst others in the sphere, the cryptographic statements (via their sigma-protocols) are truly a unique Ergo advantage. Let’s compare a project like Waves, which just has Bitcoin-like multi-sig. Ergo is also about UTXO. It is harder to do contracts in the UTXO model, but UTXOs are more friendly to off-chain and privacy protocols (also fewer safety issues). Ergo will develop lots of different new privacy-preserving dapps, and also should be a great showcase of its capabilities.

* kushti khushi, [11.08.21 02:10]
 * Ergo contracts are centered around protecting money with logic, not to be a thing per se. That's why we're talking about smart (or contractual money). After all, public blockchain means cryptocurrency, and cryptocurrency means that contracts are on top of money. Ergo continues Bitcoin ideas but with no Bitcoin Script limitations.

* Antonio, [11.08.21 02:10]
 * Cool beans guys! Thanks for jumping in @kushti_ru @Armeanio too!

Question 3:

* Antonio, [11.08.21 02:10]
``Next one.. to the Ergo team: The highly anticipated ErgoDEX release is coming very soon. What makes this DEX so special?``

Answer:

* kushti khushi, [11.08.21 02:12]
 * ErgoDex allows for AMM pools and orderbooks co-exist, with a trade between possible in a single transaction. Moreover, there are known widgets on top of the DEX already discovered, such as tokensales with buyback guarantee, a stablecoin (DexyUSD) etc.

* Glasgow, [11.08.21 02:13]
 * There's several things that make ErgoDEX unique. 

 * For the unaware, ErgoDex is a decentralised exchange that will run natively on top of both the Cardano and Ergo blockchain. This means that it'll either  ADA or ERG as the base token when needed. Compared to other DEXs on Cardano, ErgoDEX has the unique advanced of having developers that have been working on a live eUTXO blockchain for the past 2 years. (eUTXO or - the extended unspent transaction output model is based on the same research from IOHK that Cardano used when developing it's chain). This shared model allows ErgoDex to explore shared liquidity, trustless swaps and other cross-chain goodies once deployed and Cardano's smart contracts are live. 

 * Last but not least, the developers have shown they are taking every opportunity to develop a platform that prevents plutocracy at every opportunity. Instead of selling large parts to private investors - ensuring ErgoDEX remains truly decentralised. Something that is often forgotten these days.

 * You can see the roadmap here: https://ergodex.io/ and a initial public beta will be launching shortly!

 * For a more detailed breakdown see: https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-07-21-ergodex-a-cross-chain-workhorse/

* Armeanio, [11.08.21 02:13]
 * The ErgoDex has unique tokenomics and liquidity mechanisms. The future plan to port assets between Cardano and Ergo will offer benefits and tooling of both ecosystems. 

 * Cardano’s Voltaire project is something I really respect and watch closely. The powerful privacy tooling of Ergo also offers benefits for users that wish to enhance the privacy of their positions.

* Antonio, [11.08.21 02:14]
 * Awesome guys, it's like we're receiving answers from all aspects of the business: Tech/Marketing/Bizdev :)

* Antonio, [11.08.21 02:14]
 * It's great!

Question 4:

* Antonio, [11.08.21 02:14]
``Next one, to Danish: If you had to give one piece of advice to individuals about how to make the most of their crypto and to companies about how to bring crypto into their business models, what would your advice be?``

Answer:

* Danish Chaudhry, [11.08.21 02:14]
 * great question @antoniobileci

* Danish Chaudhry, [11.08.21 02:16]
 * Blockchain technology opens up many possibilities and opportunities for us to create solutions that can be highly disruptive and potentially very lucrative. Those can indeed improve on existing systems, so I always advocate for people to educate themselves, join conversations and never stop learning. Regarding businesses, we have seen very known payment providers like paypal or square starting to accept btc payments so my advice would be to keep an eye on the space and explore if adding crypto can add value to the business model

* Armeanio, [11.08.21 02:17]
 * I think the best way to look at crypto from a corporate perspective is to see it as a fractionalized open-source software license. Cryptocurrencies are tools for business and commerce. There are many crypto projects that offer a variety of tooling.

 * Ergo is involved in the BPSAA and the tooling ranges from decentralized VPN's to decentralized content storage and management. There is a large range of commercial applications available just in that small group.  

 * The distributed nature of the technology is hardened to disruption and the consumer market access is greatly magnified, especially as we move into a multichain world.

* Antonio, [11.08.21 02:18]
 * [In reply to Armeanio]
 * love this.

Question 5:
* Antonio, [11.08.21 02:18]
``Onto the next one, to the Ergo team: You recently hosted a Hackathon. What kinds of projects came out of that venture? What aspect of development is Ergo the most excited about? Are there plans for another Ergo Hackathon?``

Answer:

* Glasgow, [11.08.21 02:20]
 * Here are the results from our last hackathon - more info in this blogpost (https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-06-19-ergohack/), We should have the Raffle launching live shortly after going through some more development and testing - which also produced some great documentation for developers, and everyone is of course anxiously awaiting to see what ErgoTeam has in store for us. 

 * ErgoTeam was developed by the community developer and will allow for a simple joint-spending approach while retaining complex threshold signatures ensuring the security and anonymity of its users.

 * Last but not least, pushing for decentralisation at every point is one of the things that makes the Ergo community so great. The SmartPools team had some great discussions and put out a research paper (https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/846). Leading to another community member offering to help fund this venture.)

 * We have one or two more Hackthons planned this year - but I'll let kushti or Armeanio expand here :) Given the influx we seen last time (and how many stuck around). These events help us to continue to build up our dev tooling and guidance, and bring more people in to build ontop Ergo and see what it’s really about. Once people do, they tend to stick about.

* kushti khushi, [11.08.21 02:20]
 * [In reply to Antonio]
 * the hackathon was highly successful in regards with attracting devs, we got first wave of newcomers few weeks before the event. Six projects submitted results. ErgoRaffle will be launched over the mainnet in coming days, maybe more in future. We are going to have another hackathon definitely, this Autumn!

* Armeanio, [11.08.21 02:21]
 * Hackathons are idea incubators. The truth for solutions and tooling is that often the individuals on the ground have the clearest perspective of the problem/solution and tooling needed to solve said problem/solution. 

 * My perspective is that the greatest asset in a cryptocurrency project is the community itself.

* Armeanio, [11.08.21 02:22]
 * Hackathons are a great way to use that asset to drive growth and evolution.

* Antonio, [11.08.21 02:22]
 * 😊 fantastic to hear that it was very successful, looking forward to hearing more on the rest coming later this year!

\# Community Questions:

&amp;#x200B;

\## Question 6: 

\* Ff

  \&gt; Do you have any real world use cases that never implemented on any project and can change the world?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Glasgow

  \&gt; As far as I’m aware - Ergo is the only blockchain talking about Trustless LETS. 

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; A local exchange trading system — or ‘LETS’ for short — facilitates exchange between members by providing a local currency and a directory of offers and needs. LETS allows people to create value within their community, and barter collectively - exchanging their skills and services in return for skills and services they would have otherwise paid for.

\## Question 7: 

&amp;#x200B;

\* Pakija

  \&gt; How is this project different from the rest of the other outstanding projects currently in the market?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Glasgow

  \&gt; The Ergo Manifesto should provide some insight here :)

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; [https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-26-the-ergo-manifesto/](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-26-the-ergo-manifesto/)

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; Ergo builds advanced cryptographic features and radically new DeFi functionality on the rock-solid foundations laid by a decade of blockchain theory and development. It complements tried and tested principles with the latest peer-reviewed academic research into cryptography, consensus models and digital currencies.

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; Ergo is a unique Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency and DeFi platform, building on the first principles of Bitcoin. With a research-driven but practical development model, Ergo has prioritized useful features without compromising on security. The platform's smart contracts are built on the extended UTXO (eUTXO) model with a unique data input concept, offering a radically different approach to provide robust, flexible cryptography and easy, safe scripting on privacy-centric Sigma Protocols (non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs). Storage rent (\~.13 erg every 4 years) for long-term survivability, ultra-efficient light clients, and NiPoPoW technology. Too much to cover! 😂

\## Question 8:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Kucxgvcg@@@💯💞

  \&gt; Hello sir,,,💓💓

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; Do you have AUDIT certificates,  or are you working to AUDIT your project, to make it more secure and reliable???💞

&amp;#x200B;

\* Glasgow

  \&gt; Ergo has successfully passed security audit of certain (most critical) parts of the code. 

&amp;#x200B;

\## Question 9:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Daniel

  \&gt; Can newbies with little cryptographic knowledge be able to successfully Use , trust  &amp; invest on your platform?

&amp;#x200B;

\* kushti khushi

  \&gt; Sure, I believe now many UIs around are simple enough, not to say about crypto knowledge. At the same time, the community is planning to clearly specify assumptions behind Ergo core protocols and dApps, so even with no cryptoknowledge an investor will know what is trust involved about.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

\## Question 10:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Gia Hy

  \&gt; 1.  There are some opinions that PoW now is obsolete so why Ergo chose PoW instead of PoS? How would you resolve the “staking issue” for Ergo?

  \&gt; 2.  For almost projects in the industry they need private sale, seed sale, ICO, IEO, IDO… to fundraising in order to build the project vulnerably, so why didn’t Ergo do that. Where does the capital come from for Team to develop and Is it effected to the Ergo’s progess?

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; Thank You very much, Brilliant Team!

&amp;#x200B;

\* Armeanio

  \&gt; Gia Hy, Thanks for the question

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; 1.  Proof of Work is still what I could call an emerging technology. Therefore I think having the PoW PoS debate is very premature. I would compare it to having the electric car vs internal combustion engine debate in the 1930s (both were around)

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; Proof of Work is well studied and the security is well understood. Simplicity and complexity when married create elegant solutions.  I think if I could sum it up in the shortest way possible Ergo is designed with this balance KISS keep it simple stupid. Layering complexity in design can create multiple issues and points of failure. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; 2.  Ergo was launched without fundraising due to supporting the concept of decentralization and preventing a tiered class system that so many projects release with. Many believe that buying market access out of the gate is the way to go, but they end up with technical debt. Meaning the technology is well behind their market position and adoption. Ergo is built on a very solid technical foundation, and that makes the driver of growth organic. It is slower, but in my opinion more robust.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Question 11:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Glenn McCarthy

  \&gt; Do you have a Token Burning plan to increase Token value and attract Investors to invest?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Glasgow

  \&gt; Wouldn’t really work like that on erg. The developers did not keep lots of tokens no there’s nothing to burn :)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\## Question 12:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Habu Vai

  \&gt; How old is Your project? What are the major plans ahead? Could you show to us image of your roadmap?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Glasgow

  \&gt; Mainnet launched July 2019 (The previous spike was Ergo-First Year Token). See more here

\## Question 13:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Xyz

  \&gt; Is it true your project really support staking program? if yes, how does your stake work system look like, what are the requirements for users if they want to stake on your platform?Staking programme is very important for any project, Can i stake your token? Do you have any plan of starting staking programme?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Glasgow

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; Yes through tokenisation of dApps - ErgoMixer is up first. You can read more (technical details) here - [https://www.ergoforum.org/t/a-solution-for-staking/1057](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/a-solution-for-staking/1057)

\## Question 14:

&amp;#x200B;

\* 🇲 🇴 🇷 🇮 🇳 🇦

  \&gt; How can I trust not to rug pull? How many liquidity did you lock and how many months did you lock them?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Glasgow

  \&gt; Because Ergo doesn’t own the rug. There was no premine, no ICO, no VC funds. A small amount (\~5%) is taken from miner rewards for the first 2.5 years to support all development, marketing, etc. It’s already started reducing and should be complete by January. See [https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019\_05\_20-curve/](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_05_20-curve/) for more information

\## Question 15:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Hazana

  \&gt; Any plans to make add more to content for learning Ergoscript? There is a a massive gap between starting and beginner, making it difficult to first approach learning to write Ergoscript smart contracts

&amp;#x200B;

\* kushti khushi

  \&gt; Yes, we are always improving number and also quality of tutorials etc , for now please refer to ErgoScript by the example [https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergoscript-by-example](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergoscript-by-example) , [https://github.com/anon-real/ergo-js-template](https://github.com/anon-real/ergo-js-template) (DApp template), and ready apps, they all are opensourced!

\## Question 16:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Hazana

  \&gt; Any plans to make add more to content for learning Ergoscript? There is a a massive gap between starting and beginner, making it difficult to first approach learning to write Ergoscript smart contracts

&amp;#x200B;

\* Glasgow

  \&gt; Yes! :)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\## Question 17:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Enajite

  \&gt; Where does the project name you found? What does it mean for you and why did you choose that name for your project?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Glasgow

  \&gt; Ergo means “therefore” in Latin, but “work” in Greek. Initially the name was chosen to point to the fact that the design of the cryptocurrency is ERGOnomical.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

\## Question 18:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Arobi

  \&gt; The common problem that often accours DeFi projects is that smart contract vulnerability can lead to loss of funds, what steps has your projects taken for solve to fix this major problem and prevent such occurrences in the future?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Armeanio

  \&gt; Regarding security concerns UTxO operate much differently than the account model. In the account model, the token and the smart contract logic are separate, flaws in the programming between the two is often the vulnerability or point of failure that is exploited in the account based model. 

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; In extended UTxO the smart contract is embedded within the box (UTxO token) itself, there is no separation and each box is protected by a guard script making it much more difficult to manipulate.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

\## Question 19:

&amp;#x200B;

\* I Am Back

  \&gt; 90% investors sell tokens after first listing exchange. Can you give us advice and tell benefits for hold your token in long term?

&amp;#x200B;

\* kushti khushi

  \&gt; Ergo already listed on dozen of exchanges, and price going up mostly. Please note that this is mineable Proof-of-Work cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, so pricing mechanics and distribution is different from most of modern tokens.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\## Question 20:

&amp;#x200B;

\* HOBERT

  \&gt; As a bounty hunter, does Your project have any bounty program or airdrop now for users?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Glasgow

  \&gt; Yes we’re still setting it up formally but checkout - [https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/issues](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/issues)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\## Question 21:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Ayhan

  \&gt; Platform security is very important,how strong is Ergo security?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Glasgow

  \&gt; “In regards to security, we always tried to use the most straightforward and well-studied approach; otherwise, to cover a new direction with a published paper and a lot of testing.” - kushti

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; Each script is applied to an unspent output. We have drawn this feature from the Bitcoin protocol, which uses UTXOs or the 'coin' model rather than an 'account' model like Ethereum's. We consider this a more secure approach since boxes are immutable, as well as being more flexible.

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; Ergo's blockchain uses the Autolykos algorithm for consensus, which is a variant of Equihash and offers better ASIC resistance. This enables better decentralization. At the same time, we recognize that ordinary users who do not run a full node should enjoy the same security benefits as miners. Ergo's non-interactive proof-of-proof-of-work (NiPoPoW) allows anyone to make and verify transactions with complete confidence, without needing the storage, bandwidth and time required to download the full blockchain. As little as 1 MB of data is needed – meaning any device can be used.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\## Question 22:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Xyz

  \&gt; Is it true your project really support staking program? if yes, how does your stake work system look like, what are the requirements for users if they want to stake on your platform?Staking programme is very important for any project, Can i stake your token? Do you have any plan of starting staking programme?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Armeanio

  \&gt; Ergo has a dApp called the mixer. Developers are currently in the process of creating what is being called a staking contract. Now staking here has to do with owning a stake of the fees this dApp produces. 

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; Since there is no mechanism of securing consensus this is not akin to PoS but is more similar to earning passive rewards from an asset that produces a dividend.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

\## Question 23:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Gia Hy

  \&gt; 1.  There are some opinions that PoW now is obsolete so why Ergo chose PoW instead of PoS? How would you resolve the “staking issue” for Ergo?

  \&gt; 2.  For almost projects in the industry they need private sale, seed sale, ICO, IEO, IDO… to fundraising in order to build the project vulnerably, so why didn’t Ergo do that. Where does the capital come from for Team to develop and Is it effected to the Ergo’s progess?

&amp;#x200B;

\* kushti khushi

  \&gt; PoW is simpler and well studied to the moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; ICO was discussed back in 2017, but the result would be very different. No public tokensale/VC means totally different and natural growth of the ecosystem, which is worth long painful months of initial depression the team survived through.

&amp;#x200B;

\* Armeanio

  \&gt; Personally, I think the best way to grow crypto as a whole is simple, education which leads to growth and adoption. Ergo is a research-driven project. 

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; This is not simply on the user side. Although understanding the tools provided, their benefits, and their risks is always extremely important. 

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; It is also important for developers to learn from the community what tools are needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; It is important for developers to learn from other developers as the capacity and technology of a system evolve.  

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; That is a feedback cycle that drives growth and adoption.

\## Question 41:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Hello Sir😎

  \&gt; Binance smart Chain blockchain is having high transaction speed and cheap gas fees, Are you planning to launch your mainet or switch to other blockchains in the future?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Glasgow

  \&gt; Ergo Platform is one of the most sophisticated protocols in the space with stateless clients (for true full-nodes), NiPoPoWs (for light clients), and the ability for miners to vote on parameter changes like increasing the block size easily. Here’s an outline of the scaling plan.

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; L0: A lot of efficiency improvements in the node have been completed starting from v4.0.8.  We are going to count every memory allocation and every operation. 20-50x improvements are likely still possible by just optimizing the node code. Implementations for bootstrapping with NiPoPoW proofs and UTXO set snapshots are planned.

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; L1: Ergo's blocks have an \*extension section\* which allows the implementation of a wide variety of other scaling solutions such as \*BitcoinNG-style macroblocks\* and \*Sharding\* -- and even lets us do generic sidechains with velvet or soft forks.

&amp;#x200B;

  \&gt; L2 (off-chain) - Ergo could support the Lightning Network, Rainbow network, Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payments, and FairSwap/FastSwap protocols - and many others. Our implementation here will depend on the applications.

# Starting Questions:

## Question 1:

* Antonio
  &gt; To the Ergo team: What are your thoughts on blockchain adoption and what can Ergo do to continue to make this technology more accessible to the mainstream public?

## Answer: 

* kushti khushi
  &gt; Ergo community is making a lot of efforts to clarify things around the cryptocurrencies. Please refer to Ergo Manifesto. Still, first principles matter!
  &gt; From technical perpective, the protocol is already capable for different known efficient on-chain scalability, offchain, and cross-chain solutions

* Glasgow
  &gt; Ergo has been focused on building a concrete base these past years and build up solid foundations and financial tooling for the people. We strive to make Ergo more accessible each day and utilise our community in full to do this. Just this past week a community member has been organising a ‘Women in Crypto’ group to bring more women into the scene. And the Local Exchange Trading System (collective bartering) will certainly help there imo! 
  &gt; More concretly, iteratively building up our tooling and systems to be usable and friendly to anyone and while giving them financial autonomy.

* Armeanio
  &gt; Blockchain is an evolving technology. Personally, I think there are three areas that need development to push the development curve. 
  &gt; The first is practical use cases for the common person. In Defi especially we need to position ourselves to produce functional tools at a lower cost than the traditional finance community. 
  &gt; The second is user-friendly development tools and educational resources, I do think a part of this will be solved simply due to the technical capacity of younger generations. As building and interacting with blockchain becomes a widely adopted skill set I think we will see an influx of developers. 
  &gt; The third is user-friendliness. User interfaces are always extremely important.

---

## Question 2:

* Antonio
  &gt; To Danish: What in your opinion makes Ergo’s smart contracts different?

## Answer: 

* Armeanio
  &gt; Personally, I am a fan of the concept of multistage contracts due to the lower cost/ computational processing involved since much of the logic runs off-chain. This aligns well with the first adoption goal mentioned above. It is cost-competitive.

* Danish Chaudhry
  &gt; Ergo has many differentiators which make it shine amongst others in the sphere, the cryptographic statements (via their sigma-protocols) are truly a unique Ergo advantage. Let’s compare a project like Waves, which just has Bitcoin-like multi-sig. Ergo is also about UTXO. It is harder to do contracts in the UTXO model, but UTXOs are more friendly to off-chain and privacy protocols (also fewer safety issues). Ergo will develop lots of different new privacy-preserving dapps, and also should be a great showcase of its capabilities.

* kushti khushi
  &gt; Ergo contracts are centered around protecting money with logic, not to be a thing per se. That's why we're talking about smart (or contractual money). After all, public blockchain means cryptocurrency, and cryptocurrency means that contracts are on top of money. Ergo continues Bitcoin ideas but with no Bitcoin Script limitations.

* Antonio
  &gt; Cool beans guys! Thanks for jumping in @kushti_ru @Armeanio too!

---

## Question 3:

* Antonio
  &gt; Next one.. to the Ergo team: The highly anticipated ErgoDEX release is coming very soon. What makes this DEX so special?

## Answer:

* kushti khushi
  &gt; ErgoDex allows for AMM pools and orderbooks co-exist, with a trade between possible in a single transaction. Moreover, there are known widgets on top of the DEX already discovered, such as tokensales with buyback guarantee, a stablecoin (DexyUSD) etc.

* Glasgow
  &gt; There's several things that make ErgoDEX unique. 
  
  &gt; For the unaware, ErgoDex is a decentralised exchange that will run natively on top of both the Cardano and Ergo blockchain. This means that it'll either  ADA or ERG as the base token when needed. Compared to other DEXs on Cardano, ErgoDEX has the unique advanced of having developers that have been working on a live eUTXO blockchain for the past 2 years. (eUTXO or - the extended unspent transaction output model is based on the same research from IOHK that Cardano used when developing it's chain). This shared model allows ErgoDex to explore shared liquidity, trustless swaps and other cross-chain goodies once deployed and Cardano's smart contracts are live. 
  
  &gt; Last but not least, the developers have shown they are taking every opportunity to develop a platform that prevents plutocracy at every opportunity. Instead of selling large parts to private investors - ensuring ErgoDEX remains truly decentralised. Something that is often forgotten these days.
  
  &gt; You can see the roadmap here: https://ergodex.io/ and a initial public beta will be launching shortly!
  
  &gt; For a more detailed breakdown see: https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-07-21-ergodex-a-cross-chain-workhorse/

* Armeanio
  &gt; The ErgoDex has unique tokenomics and liquidity mechanisms. The future plan to port assets between Cardano and Ergo will offer benefits and tooling of both ecosystems. 

  &gt; Cardano’s Voltaire project is something I really respect and watch closely. The powerful privacy tooling of Ergo also offers benefits for users that wish to enhance the privacy of their positions.

* Antonio
  &gt; Awesome guys, it's like we're receiving answers from all aspects of the business: Tech/Marketing/Bizdev :)
  &gt; It's great!

---

## Question 4:

* Antonio
  &gt; Next one, to Danish: If you had to give one piece of advice to individuals about how to make the most of their crypto and to companies about how to bring crypto into their business models, what would your advice be?

## Answer:

* Danish Chaudhry
  &gt; great question @antoniobileci

  &gt; Blockchain technology opens up many possibilities and opportunities for us to create solutions that can be highly disruptive and potentially very lucrative. Those can indeed improve on existing systems, so I always advocate for people to educate themselves, join conversations and never stop learning. Regarding businesses, we have seen very known payment providers like paypal or square starting to accept btc payments so my advice would be to keep an eye on the space and explore if adding crypto can add value to the business model

* Armeanio
  &gt; I think the best way to look at crypto from a corporate perspective is to see it as a fractionalized open-source software license. Cryptocurrencies are tools for business and commerce. There are many crypto projects that offer a variety of tooling.

  &gt; Ergo is involved in the BPSAA and the tooling ranges from decentralized VPN's to decentralized content storage and management. There is a large range of commercial applications available just in that small group.  

  &gt; The distributed nature of the technology is hardened to disruption and the consumer market access is greatly magnified, especially as we move into a multichain world.

---

## Question 5:

* Antonio
  &gt; Onto the next one, to the Ergo team: You recently hosted a Hackathon. What kinds of projects came out of that venture? What aspect of development is Ergo the most excited about? Are there plans for another Ergo Hackathon?

## Answer:

* Glasgow
  &gt; Here are the results from our last hackathon - more info in this blogpost (https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-06-19-ergohack/), We should have the Raffle launching live shortly after going through some more development and testing - which also produced some great documentation for developers, and everyone is of course anxiously awaiting to see what ErgoTeam has in store for us. 

  &gt; ErgoTeam was developed by the community developer and will allow for a simple joint-spending approach while retaining complex threshold signatures ensuring the security and anonymity of its users.

  &gt; Last but not least, pushing for decentralisation at every point is one of the things that makes the Ergo community so great. The SmartPools team had some great discussions and put out a research paper (https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/846). Leading to another community member offering to help fund this venture.)

  &gt; We have one or two more Hackthons planned this year - but I'll let kushti or Armeanio expand here :) Given the influx we seen last time (and how many stuck around). These events help us to continue to build up our dev tooling and guidance, and bring more people in to build ontop Ergo and see what it’s really about. Once people do, they tend to stick about.

* kushti khushi
  &gt; the hackathon was highly successful in regards with attracting devs, we got first wave of newcomers few weeks before the event. Six projects submitted results. ErgoRaffle will be launched over the mainnet in coming days, maybe more in future. We are going to have another hackathon definitely, this Autumn!

* Armeanio
  &gt; Hackathons are idea incubators. The truth for solutions and tooling is that often the individuals on the ground have the clearest perspective of the problem/solution and tooling needed to solve said problem/solution. 

  &gt; My perspective is that the greatest asset in a cryptocurrency project is the community itself.

* Armeanio
  &gt; Hackathons are a great way to use that asset to drive growth and evolution.

* Antonio
  &gt; 😊 fantastic to hear that it was very successful, looking forward to hearing more on the rest coming later this year!

# Community Questions:

## Question 6: 
* Ff
  &gt; Do you have any real world use cases that never implemented on any project and can change the world?

* Glasgow
  &gt; As far as I’m aware - Ergo is the only blockchain talking about Trustless LETS. 

  &gt; A local exchange trading system — or ‘LETS’ for short — facilitates exchange between members by providing a local currency and a directory of offers and needs. LETS allows people to create value within their community, and barter collectively - exchanging their skills and services in return for skills and services they would have otherwise paid for.

  &gt; Read more here : https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-07-01-lets-start-the-discussion/

---

## Question 7: 

* Pakija
  &gt; How is this project different from the rest of the other outstanding projects currently in the market?

* Glasgow
  &gt; The Ergo Manifesto should provide some insight here :)

  &gt; https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-26-the-ergo-manifesto/

  &gt; Ergo builds advanced cryptographic features and radically new DeFi functionality on the rock-solid foundations laid by a decade of blockchain theory and development. It complements tried and tested principles with the latest peer-reviewed academic research into cryptography, consensus models and digital currencies.

  &gt; Ergo is a unique Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency and DeFi platform, building on the first principles of Bitcoin. With a research-driven but practical development model, Ergo has prioritized useful features without compromising on security. The platform's smart contracts are built on the extended UTXO (eUTXO) model with a unique data input concept, offering a radically different approach to provide robust, flexible cryptography and easy, safe scripting on privacy-centric Sigma Protocols (non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs). Storage rent (~.13 erg every 4 years) for long-term survivability, ultra-efficient light clients, and NiPoPoW technology. Too much to cover! 😂

---

## Question 8:

* Kucxgvcg@@@💯💞
  &gt; Hello sir,,,💓💓

  &gt; Do you have AUDIT certificates,  or are you working to AUDIT your project, to make it more secure and reliable???💞

* Glasgow
  &gt; Ergo has successfully passed security audit of certain (most critical) parts of the code. 

  &gt;https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Security-Audit-(by-Jean-Philippe-Aumasson)

---

## Question 9:

* Daniel
  &gt; Can newbies with little cryptographic knowledge be able to successfully Use , trust  &amp; invest on your platform?

* kushti khushi
  &gt; Sure, I believe now many UIs around are simple enough, not to say about crypto knowledge. At the same time, the community is planning to clearly specify assumptions behind Ergo core protocols and dApps, so even with no cryptoknowledge an investor will know what is trust involved about.

---

## Question 10:

* Gia Hy
  &gt; 1.  There are some opinions that PoW now is obsolete so why Ergo chose PoW instead of PoS? How would you resolve the “staking issue” for Ergo?
  &gt; 2.  For almost projects in the industry they need private sale, seed sale, ICO, IEO, IDO… to fundraising in order to build the project vulnerably, so why didn’t Ergo do that. Where does the capital come from for Team to develop and Is it effected to the Ergo’s progess?

  &gt; Thank You very much, Brilliant Team!

* Armeanio
  &gt; Gia Hy, Thanks for the question


  &gt; 1.  Proof of Work is still what I could call an emerging technology. Therefore I think having the PoW PoS debate is very premature. I would compare it to having the electric car vs internal combustion engine debate in the 1930s (both were around)

  &gt; Proof of Work is well studied and the security is well understood. Simplicity and complexity when married create elegant solutions.  I think if I could sum it up in the shortest way possible Ergo is designed with this balance KISS keep it simple stupid. Layering complexity in design can create multiple issues and points of failure. 


  &gt; 2.  Ergo was launched without fundraising due to supporting the concept of decentralization and preventing a tiered class system that so many projects release with. Many believe that buying market access out of the gate is the way to go, but they end up with technical debt. Meaning the technology is well behind their market position and adoption. Ergo is built on a very solid technical foundation, and that makes the driver of growth organic. It is slower, but in my opinion more robust.

---

## Question 11:

* Glenn McCarthy
  &gt; Do you have a Token Burning plan to increase Token value and attract Investors to invest?

* Glasgow
  &gt; Wouldn’t really work like that on erg. The developers did not keep lots of tokens no there’s nothing to burn :)

---

## Question 12:

* Habu Vai
  &gt; How old is Your project? What are the major plans ahead? Could you show to us image of your roadmap?

* Glasgow
  &gt; Mainnet launched July 2019 (The previous spike was Ergo-First Year Token). See more here

  &gt; https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_05_20-curve/

---

## Question 13:

* Xyz
  &gt; Is it true your project really support staking program? if yes, how does your stake work system look like, what are the requirements for users if they want to stake on your platform?Staking programme is very important for any project, Can i stake your token? Do you have any plan of starting staking programme?

* Glasgow

  &gt; Yes through tokenisation of dApps - ErgoMixer is up first. You can read more (technical details) here - https://www.ergoforum.org/t/a-solution-for-staking/1057

  &gt; But I believe this is almost done so you’ll find out soon.

---

## Question 14:

* 🇲 🇴 🇷 🇮 🇳 🇦
  &gt; How can I trust not to rug pull? How many liquidity did you lock and how many months did you lock them?

* Glasgow
  &gt; Because Ergo doesn’t own the rug. There was no premine, no ICO, no VC funds. A small amount (~5%) is taken from miner rewards for the first 2.5 years to support all development, marketing, etc. It’s already started reducing and should be complete by January. See https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_05_20-curve/ for more information

---

## Question 15:

* Hazana
  &gt; Any plans to make add more to content for learning Ergoscript? There is a a massive gap between starting and beginner, making it difficult to first approach learning to write Ergoscript smart contracts

* kushti khushi
  &gt; Yes, we are always improving number and also quality of tutorials etc , for now please refer to ErgoScript by the example https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergoscript-by-example , https://github.com/anon-real/ergo-js-template (DApp template), and ready apps, they all are opensourced!

---

## Question 16:

* Hazana
  &gt; Any plans to make add more to content for learning Ergoscript? There is a a massive gap between starting and beginner, making it difficult to first approach learning to write Ergoscript smart contracts

* Glasgow
  &gt; Yes! :)

---

## Question 17:

* Enajite
  &gt; Where does the project name you found? What does it mean for you and why did you choose that name for your project?

* Glasgow
  &gt; Ergo means “therefore” in Latin, but “work” in Greek. Initially the name was chosen to point to the fact that the design of the cryptocurrency is ERGOnomical.

---

## Question 18:

* Arobi
  &gt; The common problem that often accours DeFi projects is that smart contract vulnerability can lead to loss of funds, what steps has your projects taken for solve to fix this major problem and prevent such occurrences in the future?

* Armeanio
  &gt; Regarding security concerns UTxO operate much differently than the account model. In the account model, the token and the smart contract logic are separate, flaws in the programming between the two is often the vulnerability or point of failure that is exploited in the account based model. 

  &gt; In extended UTxO the smart contract is embedded within the box (UTxO token) itself, there is no separation and each box is protected by a guard script making it much more difficult to manipulate.

---

## Question 19:

* I Am Back
  &gt; 90% investors sell tokens after first listing exchange. Can you give us advice and tell benefits for hold your token in long term?

* kushti khushi
  &gt; Ergo already listed on dozen of exchanges, and price going up mostly. Please note that this is mineable Proof-of-Work cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, so pricing mechanics and distribution is different from most of modern tokens.

---

## Question 20:

* HOBERT
  &gt; As a bounty hunter, does Your project have any bounty program or airdrop now for users?

* Glasgow
  &gt; Yes we’re still setting it up formally but checkout - https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/issues

---

## Question 21:

* Ayhan
  &gt; Platform security is very important,how strong is Ergo security?

* Glasgow
  &gt; “In regards to security, we always tried to use the most straightforward and well-studied approach; otherwise, to cover a new direction with a published paper and a lot of testing.” - kushti

  &gt; Each script is applied to an unspent output. We have drawn this feature from the Bitcoin protocol, which uses UTXOs or the 'coin' model rather than an 'account' model like Ethereum's. We consider this a more secure approach since boxes are immutable, as well as being more flexible.

  &gt; Ergo's blockchain uses the Autolykos algorithm for consensus, which is a variant of Equihash and offers better ASIC resistance. This enables better decentralization. At the same time, we recognize that ordinary users who do not run a full node should enjoy the same security benefits as miners. Ergo's non-interactive proof-of-proof-of-work (NiPoPoW) allows anyone to make and verify transactions with complete confidence, without needing the storage, bandwidth and time required to download the full blockchain. As little as 1 MB of data is needed – meaning any device can be used.

---

## Question 22:

* Xyz
  &gt; Is it true your project really support staking program? if yes, how does your stake work system look like, what are the requirements for users if they want to stake on your platform?Staking programme is very important for any project, Can i stake your token? Do you have any plan of starting staking programme?

* Armeanio
  &gt; Ergo has a dApp called the mixer. Developers are currently in the process of creating what is being called a staking contract. Now staking here has to do with owning a stake of the fees this dApp produces. 

  &gt; Since there is no mechanism of securing consensus this is not akin to PoS but is more similar to earning passive rewards from an asset that produces a dividend.

---

## Question 23:

* Gia Hy
  &gt; 1.  There are some opinions that PoW now is obsolete so why Ergo chose PoW instead of PoS? How would you resolve the “staking issue” for Ergo?
  &gt; 2.  For almost projects in the industry they need private sale, seed sale, ICO, IEO, IDO… to fundraising in order to build the project vulnerably, so why didn’t Ergo do that. Where does the capital come from for Team to develop and Is it effected to the Ergo’s progess?

* kushti khushi
  &gt; PoW is simpler and well studied to the moment. 

  &gt; ICO was discussed back in 2017, but the result would be very different. No public tokensale/VC means totally different and natural growth of the ecosystem, which is worth long painful months of initial depression the team survived through.

---

## Question 24:

* Pakija
  &gt; How is this project different from the rest of the other outstanding projects currently in the market?

* Glasgow
  &gt; Too many to list - It returns to Bitcoins roots - and is truly for the people! Only a handful of coins hand tokenomics which are as fair. Read the manifesto 

  &gt; https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-26-the-ergo-manifesto/

---

## Question 25:

* I Am Back
  &gt; If we are in BEAR market, What are the plans on surviving on BEAR market? Surviving in a bear market is not easy for a new project entering to crypto, Do you have any plans on this?

* Glasgow
  &gt; See the roadmap image above, Ergo has more functional tooling than many coins way above it.

---

## Question 26:

## Question 30:

* Hello Sir😎
  &gt; Do you have a Token Burning plan to increase Token value and attract Investors to invest?

* kushti khushi
  &gt; No, but native token has limited emission, and &gt;40% already minted

---

## Question 31:

* I Am Back
  &gt; If we are in BEAR market, What are the plans on surviving on BEAR market? Surviving in a bear market is not easy for a new project entering to crypto, Do you have any plans on this?

* Armeanio
  &gt; Ergo is building for the long term, it was born in crypto winter and the devs kept their head down focusing on research and development. 

  &gt; The commitment to this is outlined in the Ergo Manifesto.

---

## Question 32:

* Emma Mackey ❤
  &gt; Do you have community for non english users? how do you plan to aware your project in non english countries?

* Glasgow
  &gt; We have amazing communities around the world ! See a full list here - https://github.com/ergoplatform/awesome-ergo/blob/master/pages/community.md

  &gt; We encourage people to embrace decentralisation and spread ergo in their home countries

---

## Question 33:

* Hello Sir😎
  &gt; Binance smart Chain blockchain is having high transaction speed and cheap gas fees, Are you planning to launch your mainet or switch to other blockchains in the future?

* kushti khushi
  &gt; Mainnet was launched in 2019, Ergo is oriented towards decentralization and security, unlike BSC

---

## Question 34:

* 🌸KYaa HoGa🎩
  &gt; ""STAKING"" is one of the STRATEGIES to ATTRACT USERS and HOLD Them long term.

* Glasgow
  &gt; Yep see previous answer and this thread :)

  &gt; https://www.ergoforum.org/t/a-solution-for-staking/1057

---

## Question 35:

* Hello Sir😎
  &gt; CAN you explain the background of your team?  How will you and your team carry out this project during this current pandemic?

* Glasgow
  &gt; See the Hall of Fame - https://ergoplatform.org/en/hall_of_fame/

  &gt; Ergo was set up for decentralisation before the pandemic hit!

---

## Question 36:

* Fd
  &gt; Do you have any plans to add more members to your team, as ambassadors or any other position?

* Glasgow
  &gt; Yes, growing all the time :)

---

## Question 37:

* LUPIN
  &gt; Can you give me the list about all function of your token? what user possible to do by holding token? and do you have any new event for holder?

* Glasgow
  &gt; I think I’d run out of space. See the FAQ here for a quick overview - https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/wiki/faq

---

## Question 38:

* Rian
  &gt; I think the most unique of your project is ageusd (sigusd, and sigrsv) which is bring stable coin to our community, my question is for the next future could you also want to bring those stable coin to exchanges? And what is the benefits for us as ERG holder if sigusd and sigrsv token bring to exchange?! Thanks

* kushti khushi
  &gt; It seems ErgoDEX will be the first exchange, but there are some talks with CEXes on sigUSD/RSV listings

---

## Question 39:

* 🌀ZARA VE🌀
  &gt; Could you share with us your approach to the community and your strategy to expand your community? Do you have practices that increase and encourage motivation for the community?

* Armeanio
  &gt; Personally, I think the best way to grow crypto as a whole is simple, education which leads to growth and adoption. Ergo is a research-driven project. 

  &gt; This is not simply on the user side. Although understanding the tools provided, their benefits, and their risks is always extremely important. 

  &gt; It is also important for developers to learn from the community what tools are needed. 

  &gt; It is important for developers to learn from other developers as the capacity and technology of a system evolve.  

  &gt; That is a feedback cycle that drives growth and adoption.

---

## Question 40:

* 🌀ZARA VE🌀
  &gt; Q. These days, scammers can easily throw some fake projects for their interest. And event pretending to be the best service in the similar platform. As to counter this assumption, how do you assure the investor on this project?

* Glasgow
  &gt; Reversible ICOs are possible ontop Ergo!

## Question 41:

* Hello Sir😎
  &gt; Binance smart Chain blockchain is having high transaction speed and cheap gas fees, Are you planning to launch your mainet or switch to other blockchains in the future?

* Glasgow
  &gt; Ergo Platform is one of the most sophisticated protocols in the space with stateless clients (for true full-nodes), NiPoPoWs (for light clients), and the ability for miners to vote on parameter changes like increasing the block size easily. Here’s an outline of the scaling plan.

  &gt; L0: A lot of efficiency improvements in the node have been completed starting from v4.0.8.  We are going to count every memory allocation and every operation. 20-50x improvements are likely still possible by just optimizing the node code. Implementations for bootstrapping with NiPoPoW proofs and UTXO set snapshots are planned.

  &gt; L1: Ergo's blocks have an *extension section* which allows the implementation of a wide variety of other scaling solutions such as *BitcoinNG-style macroblocks* and *Sharding* -- and even lets us do generic sidechains with velvet or soft forks.

  &gt; L2 (off-chain) - Ergo could support the Lightning Network, Rainbow network, Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payments, and FairSwap/FastSwap protocols - and many others. Our implementation here will depend on the applications.

## Question 42:

* Hello Sir😎
  &gt; Too many projects promise magic but never release any working product or prove any revenue, Within a short/long time of release. Is it like this? If not can u tell us, What makes it different from other projects?

* kushti khushi
  &gt; Ergo mainnet was launched back in 2019, and it is fully functional unlike PolkaDot etc

---

## Question 43:

* Angel
  &gt; I believe your project have a good team that is ready to get the job done to the maximum, will you take into account the opinions, contributions, ideas of your community members at any time ??

* Glasgow
  &gt; Of course! Join the chats and let us know your suggestions

---

## Question 44:

* Flipsah
  &gt; How can I trust Your project because I got scammed twice this year, did you ever get scammed by crypto projects personally?

* Glasgow
  &gt; Yes my frog farm got rugged (Cardano incubator project). :( 

  &gt; You can trust Ergo by doing your research, and realising the foundations it’s built upon.

## Question 45:

* Hello Sir😎
  &gt; Southeast Asia is a very vibrant market and there are many new platforms under development. So what do you think about Southeast Asia and do you have plans to grow there?

* kushti khushi
  &gt; We had Asian roadshow back in 2019, with meetups in HK and Ho Chi Minh, next time Singapore and Bangkok also hopefully, but currently it is utterly hard to make roadshows

---

## Question 46:

* Hello Sir😎
  &gt; Can you list 1-3 killer features of Your Project that makes it ahead of its competitors? What is the competitive advantage your platform has that you feel most confident about?

* Glasgow
  &gt; NiPoPoWs : Trustless Light Clients with Minimal Resource Requirements: Ergo block header supports NiPoPoWs that enable synchronizing network by downloading &lt; 1Mb of data. 

  &gt; Rigorous research and scientific approach: Ergo is based on original research, published at known peer-reviewed conferences. A list of scientific papers is available at https://apograf.io/c/7MEY3, but Ergo is not limited by research alone and continues to implement other novel scientific ideas.

---

## Question 47:

* 🌀ZARA VE🌀
  &gt; I'm still new to crypto, how do you make Your project easy for anyone? Including those who don't understand crypto will also use Your project?

* kushti khushi
  &gt; Yes, you can learn crypto here, with the warmest community possible )

## Question 48:

* Cheese Ball
  &gt; Do you have plans to conduct LP staking for token long term holders?

* Armeanio
  &gt; Ergodex will allow users to provide liquidity for the potential of passive yields with the caveat of impermanent loss. This loss however can be minimized as the liquidity provider will be able to select active ranges."

# Starting Questions:

## Question 1:

* Antonio
  &gt; To the Ergo team: What are your thoughts on blockchain adoption and what can Ergo do to continue to make this technology more accessible to the mainstream public?

## Answer: 

* kushti khushi
  &gt; Ergo community is making a lot of efforts to clarify things around the cryptocurrencies. Please refer to Ergo Manifesto. Still, first principles matter!
  &gt; From technical perpective, the protocol is already capable for different known efficient on-chain scalability, offchain, and cross-chain solutions

* Glasgow
  &gt; Ergo has been focused on building a concrete base these past years and build up solid foundations and financial tooling for the people. We strive to make Ergo more accessible each day and utilise our community in full to do this. Just this past week a community member has been organising a ‘Women in Crypto’ group to bring more women into the scene. And the Local Exchange Trading System (collective bartering) will certainly help there imo! 
  &gt; More concretly, iteratively building up our tooling and systems to be usable and friendly to anyone and while giving them financial autonomy.

* Armeanio
  &gt; Blockchain is an evolving technology. Personally, I think there are three areas that need development to push the development curve. 
  &gt; The first is practical use cases for the common person. In Defi especially we need to position ourselves to produce functional tools at a lower cost than the traditional finance community. 
  &gt; The second is user-friendly development tools and educational resources, I do think a part of this will be solved simply due to the technical capacity of younger generations. As building and interacting with blockchain becomes a widely adopted skill set I think we will see an influx of developers. 
  &gt; The third is user-friendliness. User interfaces are always extremely important.

---

## Question 2:

* Antonio
  &gt; To Danish: What in your opinion makes Ergo’s smart contracts different?

## Answer: 

* Armeanio
  &gt; Personally, I am a fan of the concept of multistage contracts due to the lower cost/ computational processing involved since much of the logic runs off-chain. This aligns well with the first adoption goal mentioned above. It is cost-competitive.

* Danish Chaudhry
  &gt; Ergo has many differentiators which make it shine amongst others in the sphere, the cryptographic statements (via their sigma-protocols) are truly a unique Ergo advantage. Let’s compare a project like Waves, which just has Bitcoin-like multi-sig. Ergo is also about UTXO. It is harder to do contracts in the UTXO model, but UTXOs are more friendly to off-chain and privacy protocols (also fewer safety issues). Ergo will develop lots of different new privacy-preserving dapps, and also should be a great showcase of its capabilities.

* kushti khushi
  &gt; Ergo contracts are centered around protecting money with logic, not to be a thing per se. That's why we're talking about smart (or contractual money). After all, public blockchain means cryptocurrency, and cryptocurrency means that contracts are on top of money. Ergo continues Bitcoin ideas but with no Bitcoin Script limitations.

* Antonio
  &gt; Cool beans guys! Thanks for jumping in @kushti_ru @Armeanio too!

---

## Question 3:

* Antonio
  &gt; Next one.. to the Ergo team: The highly anticipated ErgoDEX release is coming very soon. What makes this DEX so special?

## Answer:

* kushti khushi
  &gt; ErgoDex allows for AMM pools and orderbooks co-exist, with a trade between possible in a single transaction. Moreover, there are known widgets on top of the DEX already discovered, such as tokensales with buyback guarantee, a stablecoin (DexyUSD) etc.

* Glasgow
  &gt; There's several things that make ErgoDEX unique. 
  
  &gt; For the unaware, ErgoDex is a decentralised exchange that will run natively on top of both the Cardano and Ergo blockchain. This means that it'll either  ADA or ERG as the base token when needed. Compared to other DEXs on Cardano, ErgoDEX has the unique advanced of having developers that have been working on a live eUTXO blockchain for the past 2 years. (eUTXO or - the extended unspent transaction output model is based on the same research from IOHK that Cardano used when developing it's chain). This shared model allows ErgoDex to explore shared liquidity, trustless swaps and other cross-chain goodies once deployed and Cardano's smart contracts are live. 
  
  &gt; Last but not least, the developers have shown they are taking every opportunity to develop a platform that prevents plutocracy at every opportunity. Instead of selling large parts to private investors - ensuring ErgoDEX remains truly decentralised. Something that is often forgotten these days.
  
  &gt; You can see the roadmap here: https://ergodex.io/ and a initial public beta will be launching shortly!
  
  &gt; For a more detailed breakdown see: https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-07-21-ergodex-a-cross-chain-workhorse/

* Armeanio
  &gt; The ErgoDex has unique tokenomics and liquidity mechanisms. The future plan to port assets between Cardano and Ergo will offer benefits and tooling of both ecosystems. 

  &gt; Cardano’s Voltaire project is something I really respect and watch closely. The powerful privacy tooling of Ergo also offers benefits for users that wish to enhance the privacy of their positions.

* Antonio
  &gt; Awesome guys, it's like we're receiving answers from all aspects of the business: Tech/Marketing/Bizdev :)
  &gt; It's great!

---

## Question 4:

* Antonio
  &gt; Next one, to Danish: If you had to give one piece of advice to individuals about how to make the most of their crypto and to companies about how to bring crypto into their business models, what would your advice be?

## Answer:

* Danish Chaudhry
  &gt; great question @antoniobileci

  &gt; Blockchain technology opens up many possibilities and opportunities for us to create solutions that can be highly disruptive and potentially very lucrative. Those can indeed improve on existing systems, so I always advocate for people to educate themselves, join conversations and never stop learning. Regarding businesses, we have seen very known payment providers like paypal or square starting to accept btc payments so my advice would be to keep an eye on the space and explore if adding crypto can add value to the business model

* Armeanio
  &gt; I think the best way to look at crypto from a corporate perspective is to see it as a fractionalized open-source software license. Cryptocurrencies are tools for business and commerce. There are many crypto projects that offer a variety of tooling.

  &gt; Ergo is involved in the BPSAA and the tooling ranges from decentralized VPN's to decentralized content storage and management. There is a large range of commercial applications available just in that small group.  

  &gt; The distributed nature of the technology is hardened to disruption and the consumer market access is greatly magnified, especially as we move into a multichain world.

---

## Question 5:

* Antonio
  &gt; Onto the next one, to the Ergo team: You recently hosted a Hackathon. What kinds of projects came out of that venture? What aspect of development is Ergo the most excited about? Are there plans for another Ergo Hackathon?

## Answer:

* Glasgow
  &gt; Here are the results from our last hackathon - more info in this blogpost (https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-06-19-ergohack/), We should have the Raffle launching live shortly after going through some more development and testing - which also produced some great documentation for developers, and everyone is of course anxiously awaiting to see what ErgoTeam has in store for us. 

  &gt; ErgoTeam was developed by the community developer and will allow for a simple joint-spending approach while retaining complex threshold signatures ensuring the security and anonymity of its users.

  &gt; Last but not least, pushing for decentralisation at every point is one of the things that makes the Ergo community so great. The SmartPools team had some great discussions and put out a research paper (https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/846). Leading to another community member offering to help fund this venture.)

  &gt; We have one or two more Hackthons planned this year - but I'll let kushti or Armeanio expand here :) Given the influx we seen last time (and how many stuck around). These events help us to continue to build up our dev tooling and guidance, and bring more people in to build ontop Ergo and see what it’s really about. Once people do, they tend to stick about.

* kushti khushi
  &gt; the hackathon was highly successful in regards with attracting devs, we got first wave of newcomers few weeks before the event. Six projects submitted results. ErgoRaffle will be launched over the mainnet in coming days, maybe more in future. We are going to have another hackathon definitely, this Autumn!

* Armeanio
  &gt; Hackathons are idea incubators. The truth for solutions and tooling is that often the individuals on the ground have the clearest perspective of the problem/solution and tooling needed to solve said problem/solution. 

  &gt; My perspective is that the greatest asset in a cryptocurrency project is the community itself.

* Armeanio
  &gt; Hackathons are a great way to use that asset to drive growth and evolution.

* Antonio
  &gt; 😊 fantastic to hear that it was very successful, looking forward to hearing more on the rest coming later this year!

# Community Questions:

## Question 6: 
* Ff
  &gt; Do you have any real world use cases that never implemented on any project and can change the world?

* Glasgow
  &gt; As far as I’m aware - Ergo is the only blockchain talking about Trustless LETS. 

  &gt; A local exchange trading system — or ‘LETS’ for short — facilitates exchange between members by providing a local currency and a directory of offers and needs. LETS allows people to create value within their community, and barter collectively - exchanging their skills and services in return for skills and services they would have otherwise paid for.

  &gt; Read more here : https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-07-01-lets-start-the-discussion/

---

## Question 7: 

* Pakija
  &gt; How is this project different from the rest of the other outstanding projects currently in the market?

* Glasgow
  &gt; The Ergo Manifesto should provide some insight here :)

  &gt; https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-26-the-ergo-manifesto/

  &gt; Ergo builds advanced cryptographic features and radically new DeFi functionality on the rock-solid foundations laid by a decade of blockchain theory and development. It complements tried and tested principles with the latest peer-reviewed academic research into cryptography, consensus models and digital currencies.

  &gt; Ergo is a unique Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency and DeFi platform, building on the first principles of Bitcoin. With a research-driven but practical development model, Ergo has prioritized useful features without compromising on security. The platform's smart contracts are built on the extended UTXO (eUTXO) model with a unique data input concept, offering a radically different approach to provide robust, flexible cryptography and easy, safe scripting on privacy-centric Sigma Protocols (non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs). Storage rent (~.13 erg every 4 years) for long-term survivability, ultra-efficient light clients, and NiPoPoW technology. Too much to cover! 😂

---

## Question 8:

* Kucxgvcg@@@💯💞
  &gt; Hello sir,,,💓💓

  &gt; Do you have AUDIT certificates,  or are you working to AUDIT your project, to make it more secure and reliable???💞

* Glasgow
  &gt; Ergo has successfully passed security audit of certain (most critical) parts of the code. 

  &gt;https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Security-Audit-(by-Jean-Philippe-Aumasson)

---

## Question 9:

* Daniel
  &gt; Can newbies with little cryptographic knowledge be able to successfully Use , trust  &amp; invest on your platform?

* kushti khushi
  &gt; Sure, I believe now many UIs around are simple enough, not to say about crypto knowledge. At the same time, the community is planning to clearly specify assumptions behind Ergo core protocols and dApps, so even with no cryptoknowledge an investor will know what is trust involved about.

---

## Question 10:

* Gia Hy
  &gt; 1.  There are some opinions that PoW now is obsolete so why Ergo chose PoW instead of PoS? How would you resolve the “staking issue” for Ergo?
  &gt; 2.  For almost projects in the industry they need private sale, seed sale, ICO, IEO, IDO… to fundraising in order to build the project vulnerably, so why didn’t Ergo do that. Where does the capital come from for Team to develop and Is it effected to the Ergo’s progess?

  &gt; Thank You very much, Brilliant Team!

* Armeanio
  &gt; Gia Hy, Thanks for the question


  &gt; 1.  Proof of Work is still what I could call an emerging technology. Therefore I think having the PoW PoS debate is very premature. I would compare it to having the electric car vs internal combustion engine debate in the 1930s (both were around)

  &gt; Proof of Work is well studied and the security is well understood. Simplicity and complexity when married create elegant solutions.  I think if I could sum it up in the shortest way possible Ergo is designed with this balance KISS keep it simple stupid. Layering complexity in design can create multiple issues and points of failure. 


  &gt; 2.  Ergo was launched without fundraising due to supporting the concept of decentralization and preventing a tiered class system that so many projects release with. Many believe that buying market access out of the gate is the way to go, but they end up with technical debt. Meaning the technology is well behind their market position and adoption. Ergo is built on a very solid technical foundation, and that makes the driver of growth organic. It is slower, but in my opinion more robust.

---

## Question 11:

* Glenn McCarthy
  &gt; Do you have a Token Burning plan to increase Token value and attract Investors to invest?

* Glasgow
  &gt; Wouldn’t really work like that on erg. The developers did not keep lots of tokens no there’s nothing to burn :)

---

## Question 12:

* Habu Vai
  &gt; How old is Your project? What are the major plans ahead? Could you show to us image of your roadmap?

* Glasgow
  &gt; Mainnet launched July 2019 (The previous spike was Ergo-First Year Token). See more here

  &gt; https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_05_20-curve/

---

## Question 13:

* Xyz
  &gt; Is it true your project really support staking program? if yes, how does your stake work system look like, what are the requirements for users if they want to stake on your platform?Staking programme is very important for any project, Can i stake your token? Do you have any plan of starting staking programme?

* Glasgow

  &gt; Yes through tokenisation of dApps - ErgoMixer is up first. You can read more (technical details) here - https://www.ergoforum.org/t/a-solution-for-staking/1057

  &gt; But I believe this is almost done so you’ll find out soon.

---

## Question 14:

* 🇲 🇴 🇷 🇮 🇳 🇦
  &gt; How can I trust not to rug pull? How many liquidity did you lock and how many months did you lock them?

* Glasgow
  &gt; Because Ergo doesn’t own the rug. There was no premine, no ICO, no VC funds. A small amount (~5%) is taken from miner rewards for the first 2.5 years to support all development, marketing, etc. It’s already started reducing and should be complete by January. See https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_05_20-curve/ for more information

---

## Question 15:

* Hazana
  &gt; Any plans to make add more to content for learning Ergoscript? There is a a massive gap between starting and beginner, making it difficult to first approach learning to write Ergoscript smart contracts

* kushti khushi
  &gt; Yes, we are always improving number and also quality of tutorials etc , for now please refer to ErgoScript by the example https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergoscript-by-example , https://github.com/anon-real/ergo-js-template (DApp template), and ready apps, they all are opensourced!

---

## Question 16:

* Hazana
  &gt; Any plans to make add more to content for learning Ergoscript? There is a a massive gap between starting and beginner, making it difficult to first approach learning to write Ergoscript smart contracts

* Glasgow
  &gt; Yes! :)

---

## Question 17:

* Enajite
  &gt; Where does the project name you found? What does it mean for you and why did you choose that name for your project?

* Glasgow
  &gt; Ergo means “therefore” in Latin, but “work” in Greek. Initially the name was chosen to point to the fact that the design of the cryptocurrency is ERGOnomical.

---

## Question 18:

* Arobi
  &gt; The common problem that often accours DeFi projects is that smart contract vulnerability can lead to loss of funds, what steps has your projects taken for solve to fix this major problem and prevent such occurrences in the future?

* Armeanio
  &gt; Regarding security concerns UTxO operate much differently than the account model. In the account model, the token and the smart contract logic are separate, flaws in the programming between the two is often the vulnerability or point of failure that is exploited in the account based model. 

  &gt; In extended UTxO the smart contract is embedded within the box (UTxO token) itself, there is no separation and each box is protected by a guard script making it much more difficult to manipulate.

---

## Question 19:

* I Am Back
  &gt; 90% investors sell tokens after first listing exchange. Can you give us advice and tell benefits for hold your token in long term?

* kushti khushi
  &gt; Ergo already listed on dozen of exchanges, and price going up mostly. Please note that this is mineable Proof-of-Work cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, so pricing mechanics and distribution is different from most of modern tokens.

---

## Question 20:

* HOBERT
  &gt; As a bounty hunter, does Your project have any bounty program or airdrop now for users?

* Glasgow
  &gt; Yes we’re still setting it up formally but checkout - https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/issues

---

## Question 21:

* Ayhan
  &gt; Platform security is very important,how strong is Ergo security?

* Glasgow
  &gt; “In regards to security, we always tried to use the most straightforward and well-studied approach; otherwise, to cover a new direction with a published paper and a lot of testing.” - kushti

  &gt; Each script is applied to an unspent output. We have drawn this feature from the Bitcoin protocol, which uses UTXOs or the 'coin' model rather than an 'account' model like Ethereum's. We consider this a more secure approach since boxes are immutable, as well as being more flexible.

  &gt; Ergo's blockchain uses the Autolykos algorithm for consensus, which is a variant of Equihash and offers better ASIC resistance. This enables better decentralization. At the same time, we recognize that ordinary users who do not run a full node should enjoy the same security benefits as miners. Ergo's non-interactive proof-of-proof-of-work (NiPoPoW) allows anyone to make and verify transactions with complete confidence, without needing the storage, bandwidth and time required to download the full blockchain. As little as 1 MB of data is needed – meaning any device can be used.

---

## Question 22:

* Xyz
  &gt; Is it true your project really support staking program? if yes, how does your stake work system look like, what are the requirements for users if they want to stake on your platform?Staking programme is very important for any project, Can i stake your token? Do you have any plan of starting staking programme?

* Armeanio
  &gt; Ergo has a dApp called the mixer. Developers are currently in the process of creating what is being called a staking contract. Now staking here has to do with owning a stake of the fees this dApp produces. 

  &gt; Since there is no mechanism of securing consensus this is not akin to PoS but is more similar to earning passive rewards from an asset that produces a dividend.

---

## Question 23:

* Gia Hy
  &gt; 1.  There are some opinions that PoW now is obsolete so why Ergo chose PoW instead of PoS? How would you resolve the “staking issue” for Ergo?
  &gt; 2.  For almost projects in the industry they need private sale, seed sale, ICO, IEO, IDO… to fundraising in order to build the project vulnerably, so why didn’t Ergo do that. Where does the capital come from for Team to develop and Is it effected to the Ergo’s progess?

* kushti khushi
  &gt; PoW is simpler and well studied to the moment. 

  &gt; ICO was discussed back in 2017, but the result would be very different. No public tokensale/VC means totally different and natural growth of the ecosystem, which is worth long painful months of initial depression the team survived through.

---

## Question 24:

* Pakija
  &gt; How is this project different from the rest of the other outstanding projects currently in the market?

* Glasgow
  &gt; Too many to list - It returns to Bitcoins roots - and is truly for the people! Only a handful of coins hand tokenomics which are as fair. Read the manifesto 

  &gt; https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-26-the-ergo-manifesto/

## Question 31:

* I Am Back
  &gt; If we are in BEAR market, What are the plans on surviving on BEAR market? Surviving in a bear market is not easy for a new project entering to crypto, Do you have any plans on this?

* Armeanio
  &gt; Ergo is building for the long term, it was born in crypto winter and the devs kept their head down focusing on research and development. 

  &gt; The commitment to this is outlined in the Ergo Manifesto.

---

## Question 32:

* Emma Mackey ❤
  &gt; Do you have community for non english users? how do you plan to aware your project in non english countries?

* Glasgow
  &gt; We have amazing communities around the world ! See a full list here - https://github.com/ergoplatform/awesome-ergo/blob/master/pages/community.md

## Question 38:

* Rian
  &gt; I think the most unique of your project is ageusd (sigusd, and sigrsv) which is bring stable coin to our community, my question is for the next future could you also want to bring those stable coin to exchanges? And what is the benefits for us as ERG holder if sigusd and sigrsv token bring to exchange?! Thanks

* kushti khushi
  &gt; It seems ErgoDEX will be the first exchange, but there are some talks with CEXes on sigUSD/RSV listings

## Question 39:

* 🌀ZARA VE🌀
  &gt; Could you share with us your approach to the community and your strategy to expand your community? Do you have practices that increase and encourage motivation for the community?

* Armeanio
  &gt; Personally, I think the best way to grow crypto as a whole is simple, education which leads to growth and adoption. Ergo is a research-driven project. 

  &gt; This is not simply on the user side. Although understanding the tools provided, their benefits, and their risks is always extremely important. 

  &gt; It is also important for developers to learn from the community what tools are needed. 

  &gt; It is important for developers to learn from other developers as the capacity and technology of a system evolve.  

  &gt; That is a feedback cycle that drives growth and adoption.

## Question 41:

* Hello Sir😎
  &gt; Binance smart Chain blockchain is having high transaction speed and cheap gas fees, Are you planning to launch your mainet or switch to other blockchains in the future?

* Glasgow
  &gt; Ergo Platform is one of the most sophisticated protocols in the space with stateless clients (for true full-nodes), NiPoPoWs (for light clients), and the ability for miners to vote on parameter changes like increasing the block size easily. Here’s an outline of the scaling plan.

  &gt; L0: A lot of efficiency improvements in the node have been completed starting from v4.0.8.  We are going to count every memory allocation and every operation. 20-50x improvements are likely still possible by just optimizing the node code. Implementations for bootstrapping with NiPoPoW proofs and UTXO set snapshots are planned.

  &gt; L1: Ergo's blocks have an *extension section* which allows the implementation of a wide variety of other scaling solutions such as *BitcoinNG-style macroblocks* and *Sharding* -- and even lets us do generic sidechains with velvet or soft forks.

  &gt; L2 (off-chain) - Ergo could support the Lightning Network, Rainbow network, Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payments, and FairSwap/FastSwap protocols - and many others. Our implementation here will depend on the applications.

What is Yield Farming? | A Comprehensive Article About Yield Farming And Its Usages For Beginners!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTrainingFree/comments/p2z2vp/what_is_yield_farming_a_comprehensive_article/,AdaasCapital,1,2021-08-12 20:44:30,0,/r/CryptoTrainingFree/comments/p2z2vp/what_is_yield_farming_a_comprehensive_article/,NaN," One important application of [decentralized financial systems (DeFi)](https://adaascapital.com/what-is-defi/) is Yield Farming. **Yield Farming is a strategy for making money from digital currencies**. In the Yield Farming profit strategy, individuals are charged a fee for lending their cryptocurrencies through smart contracts and platforms that offer Yield Farming.

# What is Yield Farming in DeFi?

To fully understand the concept of Yield Farming, we first need to study concepts such as liquidity pools, liquidity suppliers, smart contracts, and decentralized finance (DeFi) very quickly and easily.

# Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

A decentralized financial system was created with the goal of **eliminating intermediaries** such as banks and legislatures in finance. How to implement this process is a bit specialized, but in simple terms, blockchain technology and smart contracts based on this technology allow the implementation of a decentralized financial system and its easy use. In this financial system, you do not have age, sex, religion, geography, etc. restrictions to receive a loan, and with only one system connected to the Internet, you can do all your finances with the lowest fees.

# Smart Contracts

Simply put, smart contracts are pieces of **programmed code based on blockchain technology**. The main purpose of innovating smart contracts is **trust between users by computer**.

# Liquidity Pool

Liquidity pool is an innovation created by the advent of DeFi and Decentralized Exchange (DEX). Decentralized exchanges provide all assets that can be traded through liquidity pools. **Liquidity pools are a smart contract**.

# Liquidity Provider

People who put their assets in liquidity pools are defined as liquidity Providers. These people **receive a fee by locking their assets** in these smart contracts.

&amp;#x200B;

# Yield Farming Definition

Obviously, you understand the process of making a profit in liquidity pools. People receive rewards by locking their cryptocurrencies in these contracts, which are also in the form of cryptocurrencies. 

This process of making a profit is called Yield Farming. This innovation is currently underway in the **Ethereum Network** and its decentralized finance protocols, and individuals can select tokens defined on the Ethereum platform in Yield Farming projects and lock in Decentralized Finance liquidity pools to make a profit.

# What Is The Difference Between Yield Farming And Stacking?

As you may have noticed by now, Yield Farming is **making a profit by providing liquidity** in the liquidity pools of decentralized exchanges. On the other side of the stacking process is the **locking of digital assets in “Proof of Stake | PoS” networks to verify transactions**. In both Yield Farming and Stacking processes, people receive rewards in the form of cryptocurrencies by locking their cryptocurrencies, but the difference is in the technical aspects of these processes.  
Due to the beginner to intermediate level of this article, we have avoided explaining these technical differences professionally!

# DeFi And Yeild Farming Health Index With ""Total Value Locked""

The “Total Value Locked | TVL” is one of the best ways to **check the soundness** of decentralized finances and Yield Farming projects. The TVL index represents the total value of cryptocurrencies locked in DeFi lending platforms, and in simpler terms, this index represents the **sum of the total liquidity** in liquidity pools. Many people use this index to **analyze the health** of Yield Farming projects.  
In the following, we have shown you the **DEFI PULSE site**, which shows the total value locked index in decentralized finance (DeFi) in dollars. Obviously, the growth of this index indicates the confidence of investors and the growth of this innovation.

# [https://defipulse.com/](https://defipulse.com/)

# Benefits And Risks In Yield Farming

### Main Features

The biggest advantage of Yield Farming innovation is the **amount of profit** from this investment. The relationship between fast participation in new Yield Farming projects and the amount of profit is a linear and direct relationship; Of course, the timing of the sale of reward codes also has a significant effect on the profitability of Yield Farming.

### Existing Risk

On the other hand, just as Yield Farming provides significant benefits to investors, it poses great risks to investors. The emergence of decentralized financial technology is causing projects to be attacked by **hackers**. Also, **technical problems** in developing smart contracts put investors in a position to accept large investment risks.

# An Important Point In Investing With Yield Farming

Before you start locking your cryptocurrencies in Yield Farming platforms, you should know that this process of making a profit is one of the most complex profit-making strategies through cryptocurrencies, and your slightest mistake will cause you to lose capital and irreparable losses.

The opportunity cost of Amp and why ecosystem participation is highly beneficial,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMPToken/comments/p394n7/the_opportunity_cost_of_amp_and_why_ecosystem/,GuitarAndCookies,1,2021-08-13 05:18:11,17,/r/AMPToken/comments/p394n7/the_opportunity_cost_of_amp_and_why_ecosystem/,Education,"A member of this subreddit recently made a comment discussing the opportunity cost of Amp to be prohibitively high compared to other cryptocurrencies. I agree that there is tremendous value all over the place in crypto/blockchain and analyzing opportunity cost is a worthwhile exercise. The commenter also discussed that Amp currently is not yet useful outside of speculation, coming to the main point that there are much better choices than Amp because its use is low and the opportunity cost is high compared to other tokens. The commenter's optimal strategy was to speculate elsewhere and trade back into Amp at the end of its consolidation periods.

I disagree with this premise for a couple reasons. I disagree that Amp's utility is currently low. Amp is the first crypto I've ever owned that is useful to me walking around the real world because it provides me an easy and beneficial way to spend my digital assets in a way that was never before possible. What other cryptocurrencies can be beneficial to **you** outside of your trading desk? I challenge you to name more than five and explain how you personally benefit aside from speculation. What other cryptocurrencies provide such a tremendous benefit to **merchants** anywhere? Few, if any. What other cryptocurrencies can create new benefits over time with further development? A lot, and Amp is one of them. **Participation** in the ecosystem now is a strong way to capitalize on the continuous growing utility of Amp without having to speculate elsewhere in the market. This post will explain why.

By my calculations on how to extract value from Amp, you essentially have three options, and/or a combination of any of them:

1) Participate/use Amp the way it is meant to be used and earn rewards as a result, thus driving value in the overall ecosystem; 2) Look elsewhere to make profitable trades and funnel some of those profits back into Amp, piggy-backing off those in option 1 to create value for you; and 3) Buy and hold Amp purely for speculation, piggy-backing off of those in option 1 and 2 to create value for you.

I like option 1 because participation in the ecosystem contributes to its long-term growth and there is a lower risk of losing on bad trades. People act like every trade they make is genius in a bull-market but realistically trading often is a very easy way to lose money when the markets turn south or you make a miscalculation. *Some* people will benefit most from option 2 by doing good research/analysis, taking advantage of bull market runs, and making smart trades, but I don't think *most* people have that continuous capacity and will eventually fall short. *Many* people will benefit least from option 3 compared to speculating on other tokens, or simply going with option 1. Keep in mind pure speculation may be best for those who are very new to the technology side of things where staking or liquidity pools present a higher risk of user error or miscalculation, but for those with a deeper understanding of blockchain technology and the crypto economy, I think option 1 unlocks greater value.

 A lot of us here may also benefit from all three of these options together. Diversifying your assets and your strategies is often a wise choice.

**Amp is functional. Amp's utility is clear. Amp helps solve a multi-billion dollar annual problem.**

Amp already works, and for nearly a year now people have been using Amp to collateralize crypto payments on Flexa's network, and from what we understand there has not been a single instance of fraud. Myself and many others have spent hundreds or thousands of dollars on Flexa network as we participate directly, receiving the fees from our own payments, lowering costs to merchants, and protecting merchants from fraud. The system already works at some of the world's largest retailers on some of the most widely used point-of-sale systems and online shop integrations. Flexa is being primed to work almost anywhere in North America, and eventually throughout the world. And although many people complain at a lack of news/announcements, Flexa has poured on partnerships with some of the worlds largest payments companies and blockchain companies over the past couple years. Moreover, Flexa has made it clear that by 2022 we should be able to also spend at a lot more merchants, spend airline miles, spend rewards points, and possibly spend crypto directly from our bank accounts or financial institutions, all with a mobile app. The fact that people are disappointed that Flexa's news and announcements aren't driving price is totally fine. It shows that Amp's value may be attributed more towards participation and use rather than speculators trading on announcements; an indicator that the functional economic purpose of the Amp token is working as intended.

**Those of us participating in the Amp and Flexa ecosystems are the real drivers of value. Pure speculators will often fall behind the value curve.**

People look at day-to-day price action of Amp and see long consolidation periods or stagnant prices and they think the ecosystem around this token is somehow not being used, not growing fast enough, or not going to make it. By my own and many other's analysis that perspective is completely wrong. In a few short years Flexa has built a working payment processing system with a balance between centralization for efficiency/regulatory compliance with a decentralized marketplace for collateralization and risk. The benefits of the network have never been possible before. And people both inside and outside of the crypto market are quickly catching on. Flexa and Amp ecosystems are rapidly growing. Every quarter we have seen these monsters grow more and more. Soon these projects will grow out of infancy into a more adolescent phase and eventually into adulthood, possibly gobbling up the market share from those traditional finance institutions stuck in the past. In a matter of years, those of us **participating continuously** will have had the opportunity to accumulate large positions being early adopters of one of the most beneficial value-transfer technologies ever created. Those of us buying at market tops or all-time highs in hopes of hitting a moon-shot are at much higher risk because Amp was never intended or marketed as speculative moon-shot. It was designed for people to use. Is there a risk this project fails entirely? Absolutely. Are there other risks along the way? 100%. It is up to everyone to calculate and understand those risks to the best of their abilities. The Amp token developers and Flexa team have given us a lot of information to calculate risks and rewards of participating in this project: a detailed whitepaper, two highly professional audits, dozens of presentations, a wealth of other resources, etc. Also shoutout to this community for being impressively strong at finding and sharing information in an easily understandable way.

**Current network participation enables greater long-term network growth.**

Is it necessary for Amp to have over a billion dollars of staked collateral at this very moment? Probably not *necessary* to current spending proportions, but what people don't realize is that the community by buying, staking, and holding, enables the entire system to work now - and with exponential future growth. With enough collateral, Flexa could grow to collateralize billions of dollars in transactions per day (or more). That unused collateral is a lot more than non-functional speculation. Amp is an ecosystem of payment backers and spenders (oftentimes both at the same time). And although a lot of our collateral may not be immediately useful today, it is ready to be used by spenders and merchants on the day its needed. The collateral aspect of the network doesn't need to play catch up. This is one of the ideas behind the Amp token subsidy to Flexa capacity from its network development fund.

You see a lot of speculators here come along, comparing Amp's value to other projects. And there's nothing wrong with that. I've said many times here, if you are coming to buy Amp as a speculative investment and hope the price magically goes up you should not buy it. Buy it if you want to use it. If you want to be part of the ecosystem by staking, spending, or providing liquidity to Flexa's open-market purchase and collateral reward distribution system, then I recommend thinking about buying Amp. Otherwise you are best off looking elsewhere for other investment opportunities. 

And I always get flack for telling people to look elsewhere if you're buying to speculate. Please keep in mind it is my opinion that Amp is meant to be used, not speculated on. Amp can be valuable without the necessity of speculation. For example, I wouldn't generally buy a car or a phone or a guitar simply to speculate on their future value, nor would I buy Amp simply to speculate on its future value. I will say there is more of a monetary value proposition in buying a digital asset compared to the other examples, but I am making speculations on any purchase - that doesn't mean it is the sole function of the purchase. Part of the car's value is speculation that it will drive comfortably and reliably. Part of the phone's value is speculation that it will work well and keep me connected to people. Part of the guitar's value is speculation that it will sound and feel good. Part of Amp's value is speculation that it will reward me for lowering value-transfer costs and reducing fraud risk. I make those purchases as a means to obtain the value of the asset's experience, not to speculate purely on the asset's future value while it sits there collecting dust. Amp is the same way. While Amp is a bit more theoretical than my examples because it does not harbor the same types of physical properties, Amp to me is a means of both *obtaining value* (in the token itself and rewards provided through staking), *providing value* (to merchants/other users), and *extracting value* (from spending real world goods and services, from the ease and efficiency of being able to spend digital assets, from the ability to pay with my phone, from the ability to maintain a greater level of data privacy on my purchases). The value proposition of Amp goes so much further than pure speculation, and that proposition can only be unlocked through using Amp as designed, and by participating in the overall ecosystem - currently as an Amp staker and Flexa spender but also excited to see what the future open-source Amp ecosystem holds.

**Having an all-or-nothing mentality when it comes to Amp is not necessary. Amp and Flexa help make other digital assets more valuable too.**

People occasionally have an all or nothing mentality where you either have to buy one token or another. Diversification in both asset acquisition and investment strategy is a wise choice. Many of us that own Amp own it, like I said, to participate in the ecosystem so that we can spend our crypto in an extremely beneficial way. That doesn't mean we have to spend our entire life-savings on Amp token. We are all free to spend our money on a wide range of things, and often that is the safest and smartest way to invest in anything.

It is even more important to say that Flexa, through Amp, is able to streamline and unlock efficient value in nearly any digital asset. By diversifying in the digital asset market, *and* participating in the Amp ecosystem, you are going to benefit more widely because Flexa and Amp can also help grow the value of other digital assets, making them less expensive, easier to spend, and more widely accepted. When the cost of transferring value in digital assets to real goods and services becomes much lower via Flexa network, you're going to benefit by participating in the Amp ecosystem and by having your digital assets become easier and faster to turn into tangible value that lead to life's many enjoyments.

Note: None of this is financial advice or advice of any kind. I am sharing my own personal opinions on why I see participation in Amp's ecosystem as the most beneficial path forward for those interested in the using the token."
"GS Blockchain, the World’s First Cross-Border Public Dividend Chain",https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Genesis_chain/comments/p3lghy/gs_blockchain_the_worlds_first_crossborder_public/,Genesis_chain,1,2021-08-13 19:24:59,0,/r/u_Genesis_chain/comments/p3lghy/gs_blockchain_the_worlds_first_crossborder_public/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o4p2dwjc14h71.png?width=823&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f4be3a424559fda8f78d093eb50ba558252736c

 GS blockchain, the world’s first cross-border public dividend chain, officially unveiled. GS blockchain is jointly initiated by Yahoo, genesis. X laboratory, TELUS security laboratory, etc., and promoted by the core members of the transnational joint technological innovation laboratory from Silicon Valley. GS is committed to building a point-to-point trading mode without borders, and creating a larger network and more efficient trading system.

**Technical features of GS blockchain**

GS blockchain took the lead in proposing the basic platform of the distributed chain network system. In addition to the distributed ledger framework of GS blockchain itself, it provides support of the implementation of blockchain systems under different governance modes, besides, it is capable to cooperate with different chains from diversed business fields and regions through various protocols of GS blockchain, and is able to form cross-chains and cross-links of various heterogeneous blockchains and traditional information systems-crossing system interaction mapping. Therefore, GS blockchain innovatively proposes a matrix three-dimensional grid architecture - Super fusion chain network structure.

GS blockchain provides fault tolerance for the consensus system composed of N consensus nodes. This fault tolerance includes both security and availability. It can resist general faults and Byzantine faults, and is suitable for any network environment.

At the same time, GS blockchain is committed to implementing global decentralized and ownerless digital technology computers to execute point-to-point contracts. Generally speaking, GS is a world computer that you can’t turn off. The combination of encryption architecture and turing’s complete innovation establishes the most feasible tool that can use blockchain technology to execute smart contracts, which will promote the emergence of a large number of new industries. This innovation eliminates the third-party role in censorship, fraud and online cooperation. Compared with ETH, the representative work of blockchain 2.0, GS is equipped with a higher scalability, faster transaction processing speed, more stable and long-term operation of all nodes, stronger security protection, more reasonable transaction cost mechanism and with a perfect business model. These innovative and excellent indicators will enable GS to truly practice the efficient operation in the fields of Decentralized Application (DAPP), Decentralized Finance (defi), Non-Fungible Token (NFT), etc.

**Equity Certificate—GS Token**

GS circulates in various application scenarios such as transaction, mining, reward , punishment, voting and dividend of GS ecology. It is the value object and equity certificate of each transaction link around GS public chain. GS's consumption and mining is the most important part of the ecology of GS public chain. GS has put the construction of consumption and mining ecology in the first place of project expansion since the establishment of the project.

GS's general model is designed to encourage miners to hold and pledge GS for long periods of time in order to reap long-lasting dividends, rather than a simple process of mining and transaction’s realization. GS is a token equipped with a pattern of analogous deflationary. At the beginning of the operation of the main network, according to the linear production’s reduction rule, the production will be reduced by 1% per month. In the following stage, the actual commercial demands are anchored by the curve mathematical model, and the number of GS distributed would be weighted by a floating form. The total number of GS issued in the previous two years will be 200 million. 

**Stable Currency GC**

GC is an algorithmic stable currency used in GS public chain ecology. It has the advantages of no asset pledge, decentralized issuance, algorithm driven stability maintenance, stable arbitrage mechanism, meeting diversified investment needs and various consumption transaction scenarios. GC is bench-marking USDT, and would definetly go further than USDT in the field of commercial application.

Mining model of GS

The economic incentive layer of Public Chain : POC (proof of consumption) consensus mechanism issues GS;

Issuance of GC by mechanism of smart contract : 

GS pledges GC (70%);

GS redempts GC (70%);

Smart contract constructs decentralized exchange: 

GS (parent chain token) buy / sell GC (stable currency);

GC (stable currency) buy / sell sub chain token; 

Customers consume in merchant's with an obtain of products and services. Merchants pay a certain proportion of GS to the public chain (calculated according to the dynamic business model) as a service fee which enters the GS dividend pool;

At the same time, according to the competitive mining model, the public chain feeds back the corresponding computing power to customers and businesses according to the weight of customer's consumption amount in the total consumption amount of the whole network;

Merchants and customers hold the computing power to continuously mine and produce GS;

Customers can choose to pledge GS to the dividend pool and share GS dividend rewards.

**Business Model - Consumption Mining**

• An acquirement of computing powers through the process of consuming —— Computing powers could mine tokens —— Tokens distribute dividends;

• Provide huge consumption flow for online and offline shopping malls, with a more authentic evaluation information, more transparent product information, safer shopping process and more credible business behavior;

• Based on the operation concept of  ""consumption means investment and transaction means dividend"", GS changes the buyer-seller relationship, promote the deeper integration between the buyer and the seller, and creating a more sustainable consumption viscosity;

• Ensure that consumers can achieve a more cost-effective consumption experience , discounts and rebates, with more tangible benefits and diversified rights and interests, which turns out a realization of consumption profits; 

• A Dual-token mechanism of ""pledge + redemption"" , with a dividend token as a value carrier and a consumption token as the consumption medium, which leads to a deep integration of the real economy and token economy;

•Promoters of ecological construction is expected to win an instant rewards and as well long-term ecological benefits. Furthermore, GS link a wider range of consumer groups for various industries.

Breaking Down DeFi: Beginner's Guide,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p3ntri/breaking_down_defi_beginners_guide/,pbjclimbing,1,2021-08-13 23:54:39,7,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p3ntri/breaking_down_defi_beginners_guide/,EDUCATIONAL," We have all heard of DeFi and know that it stands for decentralized finance. It is a lot more complicated than it sounds. Below are several of the common DeFi applications (dapps). Many of them can be used independently, but some of them are often used in combination with each other. There are many many more than I am including. Some of the explanations are simplified and are meant to give a general gist, not be argued about the minutia.

# Borrowing and Lending 

This might seem straightforward and it can be, but a lot of the DeFi network is based off of leverage. People will put some assets down as collateral and then borrow a greater amount and user one of the methods below to have that money make them more money

**Compound** and **Aave** are two dapps that allow you to borrow and lend crypto assets. There is a spread between the borrowing and lending rates. 

# Decentralized Exchange Platforms 

Commenly called a DEX, decentralized exchange platforms, use automated market makers (AMM) to complete trades. A normal exchange has an order book where they have a list of what people will sell and buy a crypto for and then they match two together. AMMs have liquidity pools which consist of 2\* cryptos at a ratio to each other (called a pair). The balance between the 2 cryptos in the pair sets the ratio, which is essentially the exchange rate. If one is in more demand than the other then the balance will change which will change the price.

**Uniswap:** This is one of the most popular DEXes for ERC-20 tokens and very straight forward. Any user can set a liquidity pool between 2 tokens and earn a portion of the set spread (normally 0.6%). Uniswap how the majority of people buy an ERC-20 token that is not listed on an exchange/their exchange. Other DEXes that are similar to Uniswap include SushiSwap (ERC-20) and Pancake Swap (BEP-20)

**Balancer:** A more complicated version of Uniswap. Instead of just having liquidity pairs, Balancer has multi-token pools which can function like an index. The fees tend to be hire, but you can sometimes get a better rate than going through Uniswap, especially if there is not a direct pair between the tokens.

**Bancor:** Balancer is like a more complicated version of Uniswap and Bancor is less complicated, but tries to address ways that liquidity providers can lose money through impermanent loss, slippage, and involuntary exposure

**Curve Finance:** A low fee DEX that focuses on stablecoins

# Prediction

The DeFi market is filled with dapps that allow you to attempt to predict the market. They also have

**Augur:** Prediction market protocol that allows you to essentially bet on anything (might need a VPN some places).

**dYdX:** One of the larger decentralized margin trading platform that allows leverage.

# Staking

Staking is one of the core tenants of the DeFi network. You can stake a token and earn that token, or another token. You can also stake a liquidity token (essentially the proof that you have money in the liquidity pool).

**Yearn.Finance:** Yearn, finds the best way to stake your tokens using smart contracts, often resulting in a higher return. Very active community and governance.

# Synthetic/Wrapped Assets

Synthetic/wrapped assets are essentially a crypto that mimics something else. Either a 1:1 backing or smart contract allows a crypto to be traded on another chain (bitcoin on the ethereum blockchain). They can also allow other assets like stocks, indexes, commodities to be traded via the blockchain.

**Synthetix:** Allows the creation of synthetic assets like gold, stocks, fiats. The synthetic assets are backed by collateral locked into smart contracts

# Traditional Financial Services

**MakerDao:** A USD pegged stablecoin, DAI, backed by crypto collateral. This allows banking services and is one of the backbones of the DeFi world. USDC is backed 1:1 by USD in a bank account. Tether is backed by “trust us its good”.

**Nexus Mutual:** Provides cover/insurance for smart contracts. This is most commonly used for complex DeFi staking endeavors that have far greater returns than the cost, but involve many smart contracts which could all be a vulnerability.

# Conclusion

If you are not used to the DeFi space, this can all sound overwhelming. It is very easy to lose a lot of money in the DeFi space if you are unsure of what you are doing. Keep in mind that the higher the yield, frequently the higher the risk. Earning 80% APY on ETH will involve significant risk and depending on the protocol, you might not even know exactly what the risk is."

# **Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises**

-	Policy makers have 4 levers to pull when dealing with debt
  - Austerity
  - Debt defaults/Restructurings
  - Central Bank printing money &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot;
  - Transfers of money and credit
-	The first 2 are deflationary and the latter 2 are inflationary. Which levers the policy makers pull determine who benefits and who suffers. This process is painful for everyone
-	**Template of a debt crisis**
-	Typically occur because debt and debt service costs rise faster than the incomes needed to service that debt
  - Usually, a central bank can alleviate typical debt crises by lowering interest rates, but severe crises occur when that is no longer possible. IE - 0% interest rates
  - Classically, a lot of short-term debt cycles leads to a long-term debt cycle.
-	Long term debt cycles are just bigger versions of short-term debt cycles
-	During the upswing, credit is freely available and people are willing to take on more risk
-	Credit is cut during a crisis. Asset prices fall, debtors have trouble servicing debt, investors get scared and cautious which leads to liquidity problems
-	Deflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by the local currency
-	Inflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by foreign currency
-	Positive effects of debt cycles come first; negative come later
-	Typically, the worst debt bubbles are not accompanied by high and rising inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth
  - This is because policymakers make the mistake of accommodating debt growth because they are focused on inflation and/or growth, not on debt growth itself, the asset inflations they are producing, and whether or not debts will be able to be serviced
-	It is the tightening of monetary policy that usually pops a bubble
-	No specific event or shock caused the stock market bubble to burst in 1929
-	During a severe economic downturn, protectionist/populist policies begin to rise and outrage over the governments role in &amp;quot;bailing out&amp;quot; financial institutions
-	Once policymakers shift their attention to increasing financial regulation and oversight, that typically signals the of the big debt cycle
-	It is typically the case that the first tightening or policy does not hurt stocks and the economy
-	By 1937, all currencies had all devalued a lot against Gold, but not so much against each other
-	Gold bullion is the only asset that has no counterparty risk

# **Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle**

-	Early – Debt is not growing faster than incomes. Debt is financing activities that produce growth. Known as &amp;quot;Goldilocks&amp;quot; period
-	Bubble – Debt is rising faster than incomes and this produces strong asset returns and growth. This process is generally self-reinforcing because it allows people to borrow more. This can go on for decades. These are short term cycles but lots of them adding up can lead to a long-term debt cycle
  - Usually start from Bull markets. Lower interest rates drive asset prices higher, which leads to economic growth and the ability to take on more debt
  - Lending standards are reduced as people and business lever up
  - Lenders and speculators make lots of fast/easy money which reinforces the bubble
  - As a bubble nears the top of the cycle, the economy is the most vulnerable, but people are feeling the wealthiest and the most bullish
  - The Boom encourages new speculators into the market further driving up prices
  - Humans by nature tend to move in crowds and weight recent experiences more heavily. This causes people to extrapolate too much from the recent past in both up and down markets
  - Central banks usually target inflation or inflation/growth and don&amp;#39;t target the management of bubbles, the debt growth they enable can go on to finance the creation of bubbles. And the bursting of bubbles can cause severe economic pain
  - Don&amp;#39;t only look at one metric to serve as an indicator of a debt crisis
  - Monetary policy, in many cases, helps inflate the bubble rather than constrain it
    - How to Spot a Bubble
      - Prices are high relative to traditional measures
      - Broad bullish sentiment
      - Purchases are financed by high leverage
      - New buyers enter the market
      - Buyers make very forward purchases to speculate or protect themselves from future price gains
      - Stimulative monetary policy reinflates the bubble and tight monetary policy contributes to its popping
-	The Top – prices have been driven by a lot of leveraged buying and the market gets fully long, leveraged, and overpriced, it becomes rip for reversal
  - Most often occurs when the central bank starts to tighten and interest rates rise for whatever reason
  - This causes a debt service squeeze and hurts asset prices. Which reduces the amount of money lenders are willing to lend out as they become cautious
  - Investors move from risk assets to less risky assets slowing down growth
  - A negative &amp;quot;wealth effect&amp;quot; occurs when one&amp;#39;s wealth declines, which leads to less lending and spending. This is due to both negative psychology and financial condition
  - Yield curve is usually flat or inverted
    - People are incentivized to move into cash just before the crash which itself slows down lending
  - Unemployment is low
  - The more leverage that exists and the higher the prices, the less tightening it takes to prick the bubble and the bigger the bust that follows
    - Immediate post bubble period
    - People mistakenly judge the decline to be a buying opportunity and find &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; stocks failing to see that earning are likely to decline much more. They extrapolate too much from the recent past
    - Wealth falls first and incomes fall later, creditworthiness worsens, which constricts lending activity, this hurt spending and lowers investments and makes borrowing more difficult
    - As asset prices fall, the lenders tighten lending standards which hurts spending and investment
    - This causes people to sell investments to raise cash which causes more driving down of prices and is a self-reinforcing cycle
-	The &amp;quot;Depression&amp;quot;
  - In a normal recession, cutting interest rates can stimulate the economy. But in a depression, rates can&amp;#39;t be cut because they are already at 0%
  - The central banks have to go to alternative ways to stimulate the economy. IE – &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or printing money or stimulus
  - Declines of 50% of people&amp;#39;s assets are common
  - As the depression begins, defaults and restructurings hit the various people. Especially leveraged ones (Banks)
  - Runs on banks are common
  - At this stage of the cycle, debt defaults and austerity dominate which are deflationary
  - People financial condition worsens, which makes lenders more reluctant to loan money. Which slows down the economy
  - Usually, institutions and policymakers have learned from the past, but not every depression is the same as before and this catches them off guard. It doesn&amp;#39;t tend to play out like the last one that they are defending against
  - If the central bank prints money to alleviate the credit shortage, it can cause inflation if not careful
  - A big part of this deleveraging process is that people discover that much of what they thought they of as wealth was simply other people promises to give them money. And now those promises are not being kept and that wealth isn&amp;#39;t real
  - Fear cascades through the system, and these fears feed on themselves and lead to a scramble for cash that results in a shortage (investors sell assets)
  - The depression phase is dominated by deflationary forces of debt reduction
  - The investor class experiences a tremendous loss of &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; wealth, and as a result, they become extremely defensive, they seek safety in liquid investments like bonds, gold or cash
  - The 4 options policymakers have for dealing with the depression
    - They are typically slow to react initially because they don&amp;#39;t want to bail out the people who got themselves into problems
    - Austerity – Usually the most obvious thing to do. But it doesn&amp;#39;t bring the debt and income into balance. Government revenues fall and demands for government services rise which cause deficits to rise and subsequent rise in taxes. All this is bad
    - &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or Printing Money – The moves come in progressively larger doses as more modest initial attempts to rectify the imbalances fail. However, those early efforts typically produce bear market rallies
    - Debt defaults/Restructurings – You have to clean out the bad debt so the flow of money can continue to return to prosperity.
    - Redistribute the Wealth – Wealth gaps increase during bubbles and they become glaring during the hard times. Political populism tends to take hold after this time period. Taxes on the rich become common talking points. Central bank purchases of assets disproportionally help the rich
    - Stocks usually fall 50%
    - Currency devaluation will usually be 50% against gold
    - Deficits widen to 6% of GDP
    - Economic activity falls about 10%
    - Unemployment is 10-15%
    - Aggressive stimulation usually occurs about 2-3 years into a depression
-	The &amp;quot;Beautiful Deleveraging&amp;quot;
  - Happens when the policymakers move the 4 levers in a balanced way
  - Printing money during this phase doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily cause inflation. It won&amp;#39;t if its offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces. If income is growing faster than debt, you will be ok. However, if debt is growing faster than income, you can have a problem.
  - But central bankers can abuse the stimulative policy&amp;#39;s and cause a &amp;quot;ugly inflationary deleveraging&amp;quot; IE – Weimer Germany in the 1920&amp;#39;s
  - Printing money and debt monetization/government guarantees are inevitable in depressions in which interest rate cuts won&amp;#39;t work (IE – Already at 0%)
  - All the deleveraging eventually led to big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits, and currency devaluations (against gold, commodities, and stocks)
  - In the end, policy makers always print money because it is the easiest
    - Austerity causes more pain than benefit
    - Big restructuring wipes out too much wealth too fast
    - Redistributing of sufficient size doesn&amp;#39;t happen without a revolution
-	Pushing on a string phase
  - Late in the cycle, the policy makers have to be careful because their stimulative policies effects have diminished.
  - Economy usually enters a low growth and low return of assets
  - The danger of this phase is that too much money printing and subsequent devaluation can cause a &amp;quot;ugly inflationary deleveraging&amp;quot; to occur
    - Monetary Policy 1
      - Usually try to lower interest rates first. If that doesn&amp;#39;t work, they go to 2
    - Monetary Policy 2
      - &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or printing money and buying financial assets. But over time, QE&amp;#39;s ability to stimulate the market is reduced as asset prices are high and risk premiums are low. IE – investors don&amp;#39;t want to buy expensive assets that are projected to have low returns. Investors move into cash for protection which makes further QE less and less effective
      - Sometimes at this phase, policy makers monetize debt in even larger quantities in an attempt to compensate for QE reduced effectiveness. This may provide a short-term boost but there is a real risk that prolonged monetization will lead people to question the currency&amp;#39;s suitability as a store of value. This can cause investors to rush to safe havens like Gold
      - At some point, low interest rates and low premiums on risk assets from monetary policy 2 don&amp;#39;t work anymore and policy makers look to Monetary Policy 3 to stimulate the economy
    - Monetary Policy 3 – Where the US is at in 2020
      - Puts money directly into the hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and incentivizes them to spend it
      - Government provides direct or indirect stimulus payments in many different forms
-	Normalization
  - System gets back to normal. But this usually takes 5-10 years and economic activity is slow during this time frame. And it takes investors a very long time to get comfortable taking the risk of holding equities again

# **Inflationary Depression**

-	Reserve currency countries that don&amp;#39;t have significant foreign currency debt can have inflationary depressions, they usually emerge more slowly and later in the process, after sustained and repeated overuse of stimulus to reverse a deflationary deleveraging.
-	If a reserve-currency country permits much higher inflation in order to keep growth stronger by printing lots of money, it can further undermine demand for the currency, erode its reserve currency status (IE make investors view it less as a store of wealth) and turn its deleveraging into an inflationary one"
Economic Model of GS Public Chain,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Genesis_chain/comments/p3zsv3/economic_model_of_gs_public_chain/,Genesis_chain,1,2021-08-14 10:40:44,0,/r/u_Genesis_chain/comments/p3zsv3/economic_model_of_gs_public_chain/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y34vlsepk8h71.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a8dc55252ffe4caf81578c0edb7e6d45f8f9ae4

**Certificate of Interests — GS**

GS circulates in trading, mining, reward, punishment, voting, dividend and other application scenarios of GS ecology, and is the value target and equity certificate of each trading link of GS public chain. All allocated tokens will be mapped to GS Public Chain synchronously after the main network launches.

Consumption mining of GS is the most significant part around GS Public Chain (Genesis Chain)’s ecology. GS has put the construction of consumption mining ecology in the first place of project expansion since the very beginning. The purpose of the mining model designed in this paper is to enable GS to continuously attract the participation of consuming miners, which is ought to ensure an increase of computing power around the whole network and as well as a promotion of the growth on the whole ecological value.

This paper unveils a rational design, that the early consuming miners can obtain considerable economic benefits by participating in the test network and the consuming mining behavior of the early main network phase. At the end of the testing phase, the early consuming miners are expected to continue participating in mining and serving the community for a long run, and become an ecological node to guide the subsequent consuming miners into. At the same time, GS consuming mining model avoids an excessive concentration of early mining interests to the head miners; that is to say, GS is trying her best to maximize the guarantee of decentralization, and reserves a higher income space for the miners who enter the consumption process later.

GS’s general model is designed to encourage miners to hold and pledge GS for a long period of time in order to reap long-lasting dividends, rather than a simple process of mining and transaction’s realization. GS is a token equipped with a pattern of analogous deflationary. At the beginning of the operation of the main network, the production will be reduced by 1% per month according to the linear production’s reduction rule. In the following stage, the actual commercial demands are anchored by the curve mathematical model, and the number of GS distributed would be weighted by a floating form. The total number of GS issued in the previous two years would be 200 million.

**Stable Currency GC**

GC is the algorithmic stable currency circulated in the ecosystem of GS Public Chain, which is equipped with the following features: an exemption from asset pledge, an issuance in decentralized way, a stability maintenance driven by algorithm, a mechanism of stable arbitrage. Therefore, GC meets the multiple investment needs and various consumption trading scenarios. GC is bench-marking USDT, and would definitely go further than USDT in the field of commercial application.

**Mining model for GS**

The economic incentive layer

of Public chain: GS is issued based on the consensus mechanism of PoC (Proof of Consumption);

GC is issued by the Smart contract:

GS pledge GC (70%)

GS redemption GC (70%);

Smart contract builds decentralized exchange:

GS (fundamental chain token) buy/sell GC (stable currency) buy/sell sub chain tokens;

Customers obtain products and services through consuming in the merchant; whereafter, the merchant hands up a certain proportion of GS to the public chain (the proportion is calculated according to the dynamic business model) as the service fee, which enters the bonus pool of GS;

At the same time, according to the model of competitive mining which weighs the proportion of the miner’s consumption amount of the total consumption amount around the whole network, a response of corresponding computing power is emitted from the chain to the customer and the merchant as well;

Merchants and customers are capable of mining GS sustainably in the case of holding computing power;

Customers may choose to pledge GS into the bonus pool and enjoy GS bonus.

**Distribution of GS**

The total number of GS issued in the previous two years is 200 million units, afterwards, GS will issue additionally anchoring the actual commercial demands of each year. The distribution is as follows:

• Foundation: 20 million, a linear release by 36 months. It is mainly used for marketing, incentives for community, GS developers and liquidity providers.

• Private Placement: 20 million, a linear release by 36 months.

• Team Motivation: 20 million, a linear release by 36 months.

• Distribution of Blockchain: 140 million, which is the total of the previous two years, afterwards, the actual commercial demands of each year would be anchored and the number of GS distributed will be weighted in a floating form.

**Business Model — Consumption Mining**

• New economic model: An acquirement of computing power through the process of consuming — — Computing powers could mine tokens — — Tokens distribute dividends;

• Provide online and offline mall with a huge consumption flow, with an evaluation information more real, product condition more transparent, shopping process much safer and merchant behavior more trusted;

• Based on the operation concept of “consumption means investment, transaction acquires dividend “, GS changes the trading relationship, promotes the deep integration of buyers and sellers, and strengthens the continuous viscosity from customers;

• An ensure of a more cost-effective consumption than the traditional discount rebates that could offer to the customers, as well as a more tangible returns, more diversified interests, and a more profitable form of consumption-leading-to-dividend ;

• A Dual-token mechanism of “pledge + redemption” , with a dividend token as the value carrier and a consumption token as the consumption medium, which leads to a deep integration of the real economy and token economy;

• Promoters of ecological construction is expected to win an instant rewards and as well long-term ecological benefits. Furthermore, GS links a wider range of consumer groups for various industries.

**Business Model — Blockchain 3.0 World Computers**

As an integrator of the excellence in the era of Blockchain 3.0, GS is dedicated to the implementation of globally decentralized and ownerless technology computer to execute point-to-point contracts. Popularly, GS is a world computer that you can never shut down. An innovative combination of Crypto architecture and Turing-complete creates the most viable tools by utilizing blockchain technology to execute smart contracts, thereby facilitating the emergence of a number of new industries that eliminate the third-party role in censorship, fraud and online collaboration. Compared with ETH, the representative work of blockchain 2.0, GS is equipped with a higher scalability, faster transaction processing speed, more stable and long-term operation of all nodes, stronger security protection, more reasonable transaction’s cost mechanism and with a perfect business model. These innovative and excellent indicators will enable GS to truly operate efficiently in areas such as Decentralized Applications (DAPP), Decentralized Finance (DEFI) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT). The age of GS has brought us a trusted world computer of the world. With the impact of GS, the commercial civilization has reached to a new standard, and the folks have been capable of sharing common benefits.

**Profit Forecast**

• Released by eMarketer, the amount of global retail market is $25 triillion in 2019, and it is expected to reach about $30 trillion till 2024 at a conservative estimated annual growth rate of 4%;

• If GS public chain covers 1% of the global retail market in three years, which is $300 billion;

• According to an average dividend’s level from various industries — 15%, the annual cumulative bonus pool of GS public chain is $300 billion \*15% (the proportion of dividend capital in the global retail consumption)= $45 billion;

• Based on 20 times of the price-earnings ratio, the market value of the token would be $45 billion \*20= $900 billion;

• Circulating Volume of the token then is 400 million, the unit price of token will be $900 billion / $400 million = $2,250;

• The initial issue price of GS is $1, which means that early participants of GS public chain’s ecosystem have win an remarkable upvaluation by 2,250 times!"

X laboratory, TELUS security laboratory, etc., and promoted by the core members of the transnational joint technological innovation laboratory from Silicon Valley. GS is committed to building a point-to-point trading mode without borders, and creating a larger network and more efficient trading system.

**Technical features of GS blockchain**

GS blockchain took the lead in proposing the basic platform of the distributed chain network system. In addition to the distributed ledger framework of GS blockchain itself, it provides support of the implementation of blockchain systems under different governance modes, besides, it is capable to cooperate with different chains from diversed business fields and regions through various protocols of GS blockchain, and is able to form cross-chains and cross-links of various heterogeneous blockchains and traditional information systems-crossing system interaction mapping. Therefore, GS blockchain innovatively proposes a matrix three-dimensional grid architecture - Super fusion chain network structure.

GS blockchain provides fault tolerance for the consensus system composed of N consensus nodes. This fault tolerance includes both security and availability. It can resist general faults and Byzantine faults, and is suitable for any network environment.

At the same time, GS blockchain is committed to implementing global decentralized and ownerless digital technology computers to execute point-to-point contracts. Generally speaking, GS is a world computer that you can’t turn off. The combination of encryption architecture and turing’s complete innovation establishes the most feasible tool that can use blockchain technology to execute smart contracts, which will promote the emergence of a large number of new industries. This innovation eliminates the third-party role in censorship, fraud and online cooperation. Compared with ETH, the representative work of blockchain 2.0, GS is equipped with a higher scalability, faster transaction processing speed, more stable and long-term operation of all nodes, stronger security protection, more reasonable transaction cost mechanism and with a perfect business model. These innovative and excellent indicators will enable GS to truly practice the efficient operation in the fields of Decentralized Application (DAPP), Decentralized Finance (defi), Non-Fungible Token (NFT), etc.

**Equity Certificate—GS Token**

GS circulates in various application scenarios such as transaction, mining, reward , punishment, voting and dividend of GS ecology. It is the value object and equity certificate of each transaction link around GS public chain. GS's consumption and mining is the most important part of the ecology of GS public chain. GS has put the construction of consumption and mining ecology in the first place of project expansion since the establishment of the project.

GS's general model is designed to encourage miners to hold and pledge GS for long periods of time in order to reap long-lasting dividends, rather than a simple process of mining and transaction’s realization. GS is a token equipped with a pattern of analogous deflationary. At the beginning of the operation of the main network, according to the linear production’s reduction rule, the production will be reduced by 1% per month. In the following stage, the actual commercial demands are anchored by the curve mathematical model, and the number of GS distributed would be weighted by a floating form. The total number of GS issued in the previous two years will be 200 million.

**Stable Currency GC**

GC is an algorithmic stable currency used in GS public chain ecology. It has the advantages of no asset pledge, decentralized issuance, algorithm driven stability maintenance, stable arbitrage mechanism, meeting diversified investment needs and various consumption transaction scenarios. GC is bench-marking USDT, and would definetly go further than USDT in the field of commercial application.

Mining model of GS

The economic incentive layer of Public Chain : POC (proof of consumption) consensus mechanism issues GS;

Issuance of GC by mechanism of smart contract :

GS pledges GC (70%);

GS redempts GC (70%);

Smart contract constructs decentralized exchange:

GS (parent chain token) buy / sell GC (stable currency);

GC (stable currency) buy / sell sub chain token;

Customers consume in merchant's with an obtain of products and services. Merchants pay a certain proportion of GS to the public chain (calculated according to the dynamic business model) as a service fee which enters the GS dividend pool;

At the same time, according to the competitive mining model, the public chain feeds back the corresponding computing power to customers and businesses according to the weight of customer's consumption amount in the total consumption amount of the whole network;

Merchants and customers hold the computing power to continuously mine and produce GS;

Customers can choose to pledge GS to the dividend pool and share GS dividend rewards.

**Business Model - Consumption Mining**

• An acquirement of computing powers through the process of consuming —— Computing powers could mine tokens —— Tokens distribute dividends;

• Provide huge consumption flow for online and offline shopping malls, with a more authentic evaluation information, more transparent product information, safer shopping process and more credible business behavior;

• Based on the operation concept of  ""consumption means investment and transaction means dividend"", GS changes the buyer-seller relationship, promote the deeper integration between the buyer and the seller, and creating a more sustainable consumption viscosity;

• Ensure that consumers can achieve a more cost-effective consumption experience , discounts and rebates, with more tangible benefits and diversified rights and interests, which turns out a realization of consumption profits;

• A Dual-token mechanism of ""pledge + redemption"" , with a dividend token as a value carrier and a consumption token as the consumption medium, which leads to a deep integration of the real economy and token economy;

•Promoters of ecological construction is expected to win an instant rewards and as well long-term ecological benefits. Furthermore, GS link a wider range of consumer groups for various industries.

To sum up, GS blockchain represents the integrator of business 4.0 + technology 4.0, exploring global decentralized and ownerless digital technology, and is designated to opening up a new business era called the blockchain 3.0!"
A Guide to stETH on Curve Finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LidoFinance/comments/p4dpex/a_guide_to_steth_on_curve_finance/,SlintyLinters,1,2021-08-15 02:47:39,5,/r/LidoFinance/comments/p4dpex/a_guide_to_steth_on_curve_finance/,NaN,"Hi, everyone.

Earning High Yields on Stablecoins,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p51d7y/earning_high_yields_on_stablecoins/,AlpacaFinance,1,2021-08-16 04:43:25,4,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p51d7y/earning_high_yields_on_stablecoins/,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,"Similar to the 60/40 portfolio, many crypto investors hold a percentage of their portfolio in stablecoins to earn yield on them. Where do you guys deposit your stablecoins, what yield are you getting, and what’s the reason for you using that platform over others?

On deciding where to deposit, most people look for security. Reassuring places might be large CeDeFi entities like Celsius, BlockFi, or Coinbase, where you can earn 8.9%, 7.5%, and 4% interest, respectively. Next might be old-name DeFi platforms, like Aave (2%), Compound (4%), Yearn (8%), or Curve (8% in CRV rewards). But, Ethereum has high fees and Yearn has been exploited before.

We really believe that Alpaca Finance on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) offers among the highest stablecoin yields (20-50%), while still being secure and trusted. Alpaca Finance is a leader in leveraged yield farming and is the #3 protocol on BSC in terms of TVL ($1.6B in TVL) and #22 across all DeFi chains, according to DeFiLlama statistics. TrueUSD has deposited $40M in Alpaca Finance in a vote of confidence in the platform. Alpaca has 11 audits on their smart contracts and developed many of their own security measures, such as time-locked contracts and an Oracle Guard. If you visit their Docs, you can see the sheer amount of information and transparency they provide. It’s much more than other protocols. From their well-designed user interface and NFT campaigns, you can see how serious they are about their product.

How does Alpaca offer such high interest rates? It’s not from free governance token giveaways. It’s because leveraged yield farming of stablecoins is just very capital efficient. For example, if you open a USDT-BUSD leveraged yield farm and deposit $10k USDT, you can borrow up to $50k BUSD (6x leverage) and farm the combined total of $60k. It’s a little bit like Aave, where users deposit stablecoins, borrow stablecoins, and repeat, so they are essentially leveraged up on stablecoins. But, the difference is Alpaca Finance 1) does this in one easy step for you and 2) routes your stablecoins to providing liquidity on AMMs, where you earn yield farming rewards and trading fees, which is more profitable than borrowing/lending (like in Aave or Compound). Thus, you can get 20-50% yields (right now it’s at 40%).

Anyway, let me know what you guys think. Feel free to ask me anything about leveraged farming or DeFi in general. I just want to spread the word that you can still profit by just holding stablecoins, no need to ape everything into crypto."

I tried to find help with the support but nothing. Do you guys can help me at least with the number three? Anyone used to find problems in get the contact less up and running?

Aave on Polygon Question- atokens and/or matokens?,https://www.reddit.com/r/0xPolygon/comments/p5qxvo/aave_on_polygon_question_atokens_andor_matokens/,thebubrub,1,2021-08-17 06:39:25,2,/r/0xPolygon/comments/p5qxvo/aave_on_polygon_question_atokens_andor_matokens/,NaN,"Hello friends,

I am relatively new to using both Aave and the matic network.  In doing quite a bit of reading on both, I see a lot of mention about receiving ""atokens"" when depositing in Aave - they are interest bearing tokens.  My understanding is that if using Aave on polygon, you would instead receive ""matokens"" - these are just the interest bearing tokens for polygon.  Further, I could possibly then take these tokens over to curve finance and stake them there.

1. Is the above correct?
2. If yes, how do I see my ""matokens' in my metamask wallet?  I see none, after depositing. I have added the ""maDai"" token to the metamask wallet, as I have deposited Dai tokens in Aave, but it shows a zero balance.  I can't see any indication in metamask that I have ever received any interest bearing tokens by using Aave on polygon.  However, I can confirm with certainty that I have indeed deposited (and some borrowing) on Aave and am gaining interest payments.

What am i missing here?"
Staking ETH: Don’t make the same mistakes I did,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p5r4gn/staking_eth_dont_make_the_same_mistakes_i_did/,deathtolucky,1,2021-08-17 06:49:23,49,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p5r4gn/staking_eth_dont_make_the_same_mistakes_i_did/,MINING-STAKING,"When staking ETH, make sure that you have all of the information before you lock anything in. I opted to go with Lido and Ledger Live. It seemed easy, straightforward and enabled my access to ETH should I need it while retaining possession of my keys. 

While this is true, and it does work very seamlessly, I later learned that I could have “zapped” my ETH straight into the Yearn Finance ETH-stETH pool for a higher APY which autocompounds your rewards. 

My choice still wasn’t completely boneheaded, but if you’re really looking to earn the highest yield on your coins and you have a high risk tolerance for exposure to smart contracts, there are MANY options available (Curve, Balancer, Convex, etc). I got a little excited and just wanted exposure to the space. It also depends on you volume since you need to pay gas fees to zap into YFI and to close out positions. Nevertheless, take your time to research your options. 

If anyone has anything to add to this regarding earning a yield on ETH on any L2 or sidechains (Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, etc), please feel free!"
Depositing tokens vs atokens on Curve,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/p5r6te/depositing_tokens_vs_atokens_on_curve/,thebubrub,1,2021-08-17 06:53:02,2,/r/defi/comments/p5r6te/depositing_tokens_vs_atokens_on_curve/,NaN,"Hello friends,

I have a question regarding depositing into the aave pool on curve finance.  Here's my understanding of my two options:

1. deposit tokens directly into the aave pool on curve
2. first deposit tokens into aave, receive atokens, then deposit atokens into the aave pool on curve

It would seem that #2 is absolutely better than #1.  #2 lets you get interest on Aave and then additional interest on Curve.  I can deposit 100 Dai into Aave, get the interest from aave, receive 100 aDai and put into Curve for that interest... why would I not do this?  Am I not essentially getting interest from two platforms on the same 100 Dai? I am sure that I am missing something, please let me know!

thank you"

DeFi is booming. And it is starting with lending and borrowing. In this article, we will discuss the interest rates in the crypto lending and borrowing industry. Specifically, zero-coupon bond. In the next newsletters, we will dive into interest rate swaps, direct collateralised swaps and other interesting structures.

# General Conclusion

Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is the hottest use case of Ethereum at present. DeFi has been attracting the attention of the community. In recent times, we have been experiencing a DeFi summer with the fastest growth since its inception.

DeFi is transparent and autonomous. It is a set of execution of smart contracts which operate on a publicly viewable blockchain. Users need not rely upon any party or anyone. This mechanism empowers everyone who interacts with protocols.

**Lending and Borrowing**

Most popular use case of DeFi is lending and borrowing. On DeFi, we can find lending money to strangers easily by smart contracts. This means we can give someone our money to earn passive income, at the same time borrowers will also mortgage their assets to get coins they want. The collateral is not the physical asset like gold, silver or real estate. Here, the collateral is cryptocurrencies.

**Interest Rates**

One such platform is MakerDAO which has 2.8M $ETH locked (\~2.45% existing $ETH supply). MakerDAO provides $DAI — a stablecoin, when users lock-in ETH. $DAI is tried to peg at $1. It provides liquidity into the MakerDAO system. There are many other DeFi dapps like Compound, Aave, Sushiswap, etc. who use $DAI. They are providing different types of lending and borrowing assets which is backed by collaterals. Borrow and lend relate to the **floating (or variable) interest rate.** DeFi is doing well.

&gt;But, DeFi still lacks one important tool which provides **the fixed interest rate.**

# Fixed Interest Rate

In traditional finance, the Fixed interest rate often understood as low-risk interest rates and almost absolutely safe. It is a needed and important factor. Clearly, it affects other factors in the economy: lending rates of banks, Interbank interest rates, Gold Price, Real Estate Price, etc. On a more macro level, one country's interest rates can affect other countries with each trading relationship.

On DeFi the same. The Fixed Interest Rate will impact investor's behaviour because a rational investor always tries to produce a yield greater than the fixed interest rate (in this case). That means it will impact our portfolio.

Fixed Interest Rate does not change during a loan period, allowing borrowers/lenders to accurately predict how much they need to pay or receive in future.

Currently, DeFi has a lot of projects starting to implement fixed-rate products with 2 main approaches:

(1) Zero-coupon bond.

(2) Direct Collateralised Swap.

# Zero-Coupon Bond

A zero-coupon bond (ZCB) pays a fixed yield on maturity. The crypto market is volatile and lending-borrowing is taking place on a variable rate of interest. But other one wants to control risky better by using the fixed interest rate products. Non-availability of a fixed rate of interest is a barrier towards mass adoption of DeFi.

## So what is zero-coupon bond ?

&gt;A zero-coupon bond is a type of bond that does not pay interest periodically. That is interest is paid at the time of the bond purchase or on the maturity date.

### Valuation

The present value of the bond is determined by its future face value, the interest rate of the bond and the duration of the bond.

    PNV = (FaceValue)/(1+r)^n

All things equal,

* Higher duration = lower price to pay now
* Higher face value = higher price to pay now
* Higher interest rate = lower price to pay now

## In DeFi

2 ways we see zero-coupon bond concept:

1. An ERC20 token with the above mechanism — lower price now for future payouts
2. Protocol like YIELD.IS

### ERC20 token as zero-coupon bond

Crypto research company Paradigm published a whitepaper (April 2020) depicting how to make and issuance of the zero-coupon bond as ERC20 tokens which is called yTokens.

As this whitepaper, ""*yTokens are like the zero-coupon bonds and are backed by collateral in another asset. By buying or selling y Tokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a fixed term. yTokens are fungible and trade at a floating price, which means their “interest rates” are determined by the market. The prices of yTokens of varying maturities can be used to infer interest rates, and even to construct a yield curve. Depending on the target asset, yTokens can settle through “cash-settlement” using an on-chain price oracle, through “physical settlement” in the target ERC20 token, or by synthetically issuing or borrowing the target ERC20 token on another platform.""*

To make sense easier, participants in the protocols using zero-coupon bond include the borrower, the lender, the liquidity provider.

* **The borrower** will mortgage the asset, in exchange for the token representing the loan, debt tokens can be redeemed at a fixed value in the future. The borrower then sells the debt token at a discount.
* **The lender** is a person who buys a bond at a discount price and receives interest when the bond matures.
* **The liquidity provider** that will provide liquidity for the bond in return receives transaction fees and profits when the bond matures.  
📷

yToken's yield doesn't rely upon system governance. It decides price according to market price rather than depending on governance or any formula.

Compare with $DAI, the problem of $DAI is that it is pegged to $1 but the collateral is not USD and the interest rate is continuously changed by the governance model, theoretically. But yToken price is expected to float and the interest rate will be determined by the trade discount. It also will have an expiration date. If you hold yToken for a certain period, you would earn predictable of interest and if you withdraw early (difference with selling), you may incur a loss.

**But how does the system work exactly?**

""You can create yTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to effectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying yTokens is economically similar to lending\* the target asset. The effective ‘interest rate’ received by yToken holders is determined by the discount at which yTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.”

\**Lending the asset because when you buy the bond via owning yTokens, it transfers the ownership of the collateral from the depositor to you.*

A sample use case:

James wants to lend 10,000 $ETH and earns interest for 1 month. The current price of yToken (that bond token) is 0.98 $ETH. With 10,000 $ETH, he can get 10,204.08 yTokens.

If he keeps it for 1 year, he will get out 204.08 $ETH.

But he only wants to keep it for 1 month. So he earns 17 $ETH. (204.08/17)

At the end of 1 month, he gets back his principle (10,000 ETH) and interest (17 ETH).

The volatility of $ETH does not affect the yield in $ETH as the yToken has been issued against the borrower's collateralised Ethereum.

&gt;Aka, the principle and interest are denominated in the same asset. Hence, not affected by volatility.

## New Same DeFi Product

### Reflex Bond

One of those top upstart efforts is **Reflex bonds** by blockchain developer Stefan Ionescu. he outlined how to create a bond product on Ethereum that provide price stability (as stablecoins) without maintaining an arbitrary and common in the cryptoeconomy to date.

In other words, reflex bonds would have ""floating redemption prices""-the same with $yToken that I mentioned, that has the ability to minimise the price volatility from the market compared to stablecoins.

The purpose of a reflex bond is to be a more stable representation of its collateral while maintaining a high level of reliability. If it is used in other platforms, a reflex bond can protect its user from huge and sudden volatility.

### Notional Finance

Notional Finance has launched a fixed-rate borrowing/lending protocol through a financial method called $fCash. $fCash are negotiable tokens that represent positive or negative cash flow requirements at a specific point in the future, and can be traded against the base currency (e.g. $DAI, $USDC) in the liquidity groups that support AMM.

Lenders buy $fCash and close a rate that represents the amount of the base currency they can claim against their $fCash at maturity. The borrower uses $fCash and can sell it to receive the base currency, in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the base currency at a specific time in the future. $fCash tokens are always paired - assets and liabilities are always zero on the Notional system.

### UMA's yUSD

UMA has launched its first yield dollar token -$yUSD (SEP20), which is essentially a zero-coupon bond redeemable for $1 at the expiry date and can be traded with $USDC through Balancer AMM.

**TLDR:**

&gt;Economics of tokenisation and ecosystem is free weekly in your inbox. Please share it with anyone that can benefit from this knowledge.

We have explained that those products about Fixed Interest Rate, although they are quite new they are essential in the DeFi space. More Fixed Interest Rate products will appear in the future and are intended for those who want risk control and easy access to traditional investment firms that use Fixed Interest Rates for their portfolios.

Next, we will continue to showcase another interesting product, the Interest Rate Swap. They are also in essence a derivative product."

### Reflex Bond

One of those top upstart efforts is **Reflex bonds** by blockchain developer Stefan Ionescu. he outlined how to create a bond product on Ethereum that provide price stability (as stablecoins) without maintaining an arbitrary and common in the cryptoeconomy to date.In other words, reflex bonds would have ""floating redemption prices""-the same with $yToken that I mentioned, that has the ability to minimise the price volatility from the market compared to stablecoins.The purpose of a reflex bond is to be a more stable representation of its collateral while maintaining a high level of reliability. If it is used in other platforms, a reflex bond can protect its user from huge and sudden volatility.

### Notional Finance

Notional Finance has launched a fixed-rate borrowing/lending protocol through a financial method called $fCash. $fCash are negotiable tokens that represent positive or negative cash flow requirements at a specific point in the future, and can be traded against the base currency (e.g. $DAI, $USDC) in the liquidity groups that support AMM.Lenders buy $fCash and close a rate that represents the amount of the base currency they can claim against their $fCash at maturity. The borrower uses $fCash and can sell it to receive the base currency, in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the base currency at a specific time in the future. $fCash tokens are always paired - assets and liabilities are always zero on the Notional system.

# General Conclusion

Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is the hottest use case of Ethereum at present. DeFi has been attracting the attention of the community. In recent times, we have been experiencing a DeFi summer with the fastest growth since its inception.DeFi is transparent and autonomous. It is a set of execution of smart contracts which operate on a publicly viewable blockchain. Users need not rely upon any party or anyone. This mechanism empowers everyone who interacts with protocols.**Lending and Borrowing**Most popular use case of DeFi is lending and borrowing. On DeFi, we can find lending money to strangers easily by smart contracts. This means we can give someone our money to earn passive income, at the same time borrowers will also mortgage their assets to get coins they want. The collateral is not the physical asset like gold, silver or real estate. Here, the collateral is cryptocurrencies.**Interest Rates**One such platform is MakerDAO which has 2.8M $ETH locked (\~2.45% existing $ETH supply). MakerDAO provides $DAI — a stablecoin, when users lock-in ETH. $DAI is tried to peg at $1. It provides liquidity into the MakerDAO system. There are many other DeFi dapps like Compound, Aave, Sushiswap, etc. who use $DAI. They are providing different types of lending and borrowing assets which is backed by collaterals. Borrow and lend relate to the **floating (or variable) interest rate.** DeFi is doing well.

&gt;But, DeFi still lacks one important tool which provides **the fixed interest rate.**

# Fixed Interest Rate

In traditional finance, the Fixed interest rate often understood as low-risk interest rates and almost absolutely safe. It is a needed and important factor. Clearly, it affects other factors in the economy: lending rates of banks, Interbank interest rates, Gold Price, Real Estate Price, etc. On a more macro level, one country's interest rates can affect other countries with each trading relationship.On DeFi the same. The Fixed Interest Rate will impact investor's behaviour because a rational investor always tries to produce a yield greater than the fixed interest rate (in this case). That means it will impact our portfolio.Fixed Interest Rate does not change during a loan period, allowing borrowers/lenders to accurately predict how much they need to pay or receive in future.Currently, DeFi has a lot of projects starting to implement fixed-rate products with 2 main approaches:(1) Zero-coupon bond.(2) Direct Collateralised Swap.

# Zero-Coupon Bond

A zero-coupon bond (ZCB) pays a fixed yield on maturity. The crypto market is volatile and lending-borrowing is taking place on a variable rate of interest. But other one wants to control risky better by using the fixed interest rate products. Non-availability of a fixed rate of interest is a barrier towards mass adoption of DeFi.

## So what is zero-coupon bond ?

&gt;A zero-coupon bond is a type of bond that does not pay interest periodically. That is interest is paid at the time of the bond purchase or on the maturity date.

### Valuation

The present value of the bond is determined by its future face value, the interest rate of the bond and the duration of the bond.

    PNV = (FaceValue)/(1+r)^n

All things equal,

* Higher duration = lower price to pay now
* Higher face value = higher price to pay now
* Higher interest rate = lower price to pay now

## In DeFi

2 ways we see zero-coupon bond concept:

1. An ERC20 token with the above mechanism — lower price now for future payouts
2. Protocol like YIELD.IS

### ERC20 token as zero-coupon bond

Crypto research company Paradigm published a whitepaper (April 2020) depicting how to make and issuance of the zero-coupon bond as ERC20 tokens which is called yTokens.As this whitepaper, ""*yTokens are like the zero-coupon bonds and are backed by collateral in another asset. By buying or selling y Tokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a fixed term. yTokens are fungible and trade at a floating price, which means their “interest rates” are determined by the market. The prices of yTokens of varying maturities can be used to infer interest rates, and even to construct a yield curve. Depending on the target asset, yTokens can settle through “cash-settlement” using an on-chain price oracle, through “physical settlement” in the target ERC20 token, or by synthetically issuing or borrowing the target ERC20 token on another platform.""*To make sense easier, participants in the protocols using zero-coupon bond include the borrower, the lender, the liquidity provider.

* **The borrower** will mortgage the asset, in exchange for the token representing the loan, debt tokens can be redeemed at a fixed value in the future. The borrower then sells the debt token at a discount.
* **The lender** is a person who buys a bond at a discount price and receives interest when the bond matures.
* **The liquidity provider** that will provide liquidity for the bond in return receives transaction fees and profits when the bond matures. 📷

yToken's yield doesn't rely upon system governance. It decides price according to market price rather than depending on governance or any formula.Compare with $DAI, the problem of $DAI is that it is pegged to $1 but the collateral is not USD and the interest rate is continuously changed by the governance model, theoretically. But yToken price is expected to float and the interest rate will be determined by the trade discount. It also will have an expiration date. If you hold yToken for a certain period, you would earn predictable of interest and if you withdraw early (difference with selling), you may incur a loss.**But how does the system work exactly?**""You can create yTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to effectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying yTokens is economically similar to lending\* the target asset. The effective ‘interest rate’ received by yToken holders is determined by the discount at which yTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.”\**Lending the asset because when you buy the bond via owning yTokens, it transfers the ownership of the collateral from the depositor to you.*A sample use case:James wants to lend 10,000 $ETH and earns interest for 1 month.

There are many other DeFi dapps like Compound, Aave, Sushiswap, etc. who use $DAI. They are providing different types of lending and borrowing assets which is backed by collaterals. Borrow and lend relate to the **floating (or variable) interest rate.** DeFi is doing well.

&gt;But, DeFi still lacks one important tool which provides **the fixed interest rate.**

# Fixed Interest Rate

In traditional finance, the Fixed interest rate often understood as low-risk interest rates and almost absolutely safe. It is a needed and important factor. Clearly, it affects other factors in the economy: lending rates of banks, Interbank interest rates, Gold Price, Real Estate Price, etc. On a more macro level, one country's interest rates can affect other countries with each trading relationship.On DeFi the same. The Fixed Interest Rate will impact investor's behaviour because a rational investor always tries to produce a yield greater than the fixed interest rate (in this case). That means it will impact our portfolio.Fixed Interest Rate does not change during a loan period, allowing borrowers/lenders to accurately predict how much they need to pay or receive in future.Currently, DeFi has a lot of projects starting to implement fixed-rate products with 2 main approaches:(1) Zero-coupon bond.(2) Direct Collateralised Swap.

# Zero-Coupon Bond

A zero-coupon bond (ZCB) pays a fixed yield on maturity. The crypto market is volatile and lending-borrowing is taking place on a variable rate of interest. But other one wants to control risky better by using the fixed interest rate products. Non-availability of a fixed rate of interest is a barrier towards mass adoption of DeFi.

## So what is zero-coupon bond ?

&gt;A zero-coupon bond is a type of bond that does not pay interest periodically. That is interest is paid at the time of the bond purchase or on the maturity date.

### Valuation

The present value of the bond is determined by its future face value, the interest rate of the bond and the duration of the bond.

    PNV = (FaceValue)/(1+r)^n

All things equal,

* Higher duration = lower price to pay now
* Higher face value = higher price to pay now
* Higher interest rate = lower price to pay now

## In DeFi

2 ways we see zero-coupon bond concept:

1. An ERC20 token with the above mechanism — lower price now for future payouts
2. Protocol like YIELD.IS

### ERC20 token as zero-coupon bond

Crypto research company Paradigm published a whitepaper (April 2020) depicting how to make and issuance of the zero-coupon bond as ERC20 tokens which is called yTokens.As this whitepaper, ""*yTokens are like the zero-coupon bonds and are backed by collateral in another asset. By buying or selling y Tokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a fixed term. yTokens are fungible and trade at a floating price, which means their “interest rates” are determined by the market. The prices of yTokens of varying maturities can be used to infer interest rates, and even to construct a yield curve. Depending on the target asset, yTokens can settle through “cash-settlement” using an on-chain price oracle, through “physical settlement” in the target ERC20 token, or by synthetically issuing or borrowing the target ERC20 token on another platform.""*To make sense easier, participants in the protocols using zero-coupon bond include the borrower, the lender, the liquidity provider.

* **The borrower** will mortgage the asset, in exchange for the token representing the loan, debt tokens can be redeemed at a fixed value in the future. The borrower then sells the debt token at a discount.
* **The lender** is a person who buys a bond at a discount price and receives interest when the bond matures.
* **The liquidity provider** that will provide liquidity for the bond in return receives transaction fees and profits when the bond matures. 📷

yToken's yield doesn't rely upon system governance. It decides price according to market price rather than depending on governance or any formula.Compare with $DAI, the problem of $DAI is that it is pegged to $1 but the collateral is not USD and the interest rate is continuously changed by the governance model, theoretically. But yToken price is expected to float and the interest rate will be determined by the trade discount. It also will have an expiration date. If you hold yToken for a certain period, you would earn predictable of interest and if you withdraw early (difference with selling), you may incur a loss.**But how does the system work exactly?**""You can create yTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to effectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying yTokens is economically similar to lending\* the target asset. The effective ‘interest rate’ received by yToken holders is determined by the discount at which yTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.”\**Lending the asset because when you buy the bond via owning yTokens, it transfers the ownership of the collateral from the depositor to you.*A sample use case:James wants to lend 10,000 $ETH and earns interest for 1 month. The current price of yToken (that bond token) is 0.98 $ETH. With 10,000 $ETH, he can get 10,204.08 yTokens.If he keeps it for 1 year, he will get out 204.08 $ETH.But he only wants to keep it for 1 month. So he earns 17 $ETH. (204.08/17)At the end of 1 month, he gets back his principle (10,000 ETH) and interest (17 ETH).The volatility of $ETH does not affect the yield in $ETH as the yToken has been issued against the borrower's collateralised Ethereum.

&gt;Aka, the principle and interest are denominated in the same asset. Hence, not affected by volatility.

### Reflex Bond

One of those top upstart efforts is **Reflex bonds** by blockchain developer Stefan Ionescu. he outlined how to create a bond product on Ethereum that provide price stability (as stablecoins) without maintaining an arbitrary and common in the cryptoeconomy to date.In other words, reflex bonds would have ""floating redemption prices""-the same with $yToken that I mentioned, that has the ability to minimise the price volatility from the market compared to stablecoins.The purpose of a reflex bond is to be a more stable representation of its collateral while maintaining a high level of reliability. If it is used in other platforms, a reflex bond can protect its user from huge and sudden volatility.

### Notional Finance

Notional Finance has launched a fixed-rate borrowing/lending protocol through a financial method called $fCash. $fCash are negotiable tokens that represent positive or negative cash flow requirements at a specific point in the future, and can be traded against the base currency (e.g. $DAI, $USDC) in the liquidity groups that support AMM.Lenders buy $fCash and close a rate that represents the amount of the base currency they can claim against their $fCash at maturity. The borrower uses $fCash and can sell it to receive the base currency, in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the base currency at a specific time in the future. $fCash tokens are always paired - assets and liabilities are always zero on the Notional system.

### UMA's yUSD

UMA has launched its first yield dollar token -$yUSD (SEP20), which is essentially a zero-coupon bond redeemable for $1 at the expiry date and can be traded with $USDC through Balancer AMM.**TLDR:**

With 10,000 $ETH, he can get 10,204.08 yTokens.If he keeps it for 1 year, he will get out 204.08 $ETH.But he only wants to keep it for 1 month. So he earns 17 $ETH. (204.08/17)At the end of 1 month, he gets back his principle (10,000 ETH) and interest (17 ETH).The volatility of $ETH does not affect the yield in $ETH as the yToken has been issued against the borrower's collateralised Ethereum.

&gt;Aka, the principle and interest are denominated in the same asset. Hence, not affected by volatility.

## New Same DeFi Product

### Reflex Bond

One of those top upstart efforts is **Reflex bonds** by blockchain developer Stefan Ionescu. he outlined how to create a bond product on Ethereum that provide price stability (as stablecoins) without maintaining an arbitrary and common in the cryptoeconomy to date.In other words, reflex bonds would have ""floating redemption prices""-the same with $yToken that I mentioned, that has the ability to minimise the price volatility from the market compared to stablecoins.The purpose of a reflex bond is to be a more stable representation of its collateral while maintaining a high level of reliability. If it is used in other platforms, a reflex bond can protect its user from huge and sudden volatility.

### Notional Finance

Notional Finance has launched a fixed-rate borrowing/lending protocol through a financial method called $fCash. $fCash are negotiable tokens that represent positive or negative cash flow requirements at a specific point in the future, and can be traded against the base currency (e.g. $DAI, $USDC) in the liquidity groups that support AMM.Lenders buy $fCash and close a rate that represents the amount of the base currency they can claim against their $fCash at maturity. The borrower uses $fCash and can sell it to receive the base currency, in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the base currency at a specific time in the future. $fCash tokens are always paired - assets and liabilities are always zero on the Notional system.

### UMA's yUSD

UMA has launched its first yield dollar token -$yUSD (SEP20), which is essentially a zero-coupon bond redeemable for $1 at the expiry date and can be traded with $USDC through Balancer AMM.**TLDR:**

We have explained that those products about Fixed Interest Rate, although they are quite new they are essential in the DeFi space. More Fixed Interest Rate products will appear in the future and are intended for those who want risk control and easy access to traditional investment firms that use Fixed Interest Rates for their portfolios.Next, we will continue to showcase another interesting product, the Interest Rate Swap. They are also in essence a derivative product."

Debating the jump back to school to enter this career field,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p6g373/debating_the_jump_back_to_school_to_enter_this/,bears_gm,1,2021-08-18 08:19:03,2,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/p6g373/debating_the_jump_back_to_school_to_enter_this/,Student,"Hi all, Hope this is allowed.

Finance major, 27 yo (28 by end of year) who graduated with a major in Finance only 2 years ago (Dec. 2019). Pay has been underwhelming. Wayy more cut throat and 'who you know' type industry than I was expecting. I will be leaving my job, but I'm trying to figure out a plan. I'm 28k deep in loans, with an amount just above that available. I went to school for the security, thinking Finance would have the inc. and security I was looking for.. feeling like that was wrong.

I've been lurking on the sub for awhile and have generally gotten the sense, life's good in cs. I'd be making the change hoping for work-life balance and a good salary - what I thought I'd get with my major. I have a few questions hoping anyone could maybe help narrow my choices for me.

1. Do I need to go back and remajor in CS if I'm hoping to become a SW Developer or would you recommend a different path?
2.  Is entry-level pay decent? (I ask because I'd likely need to take out more in loans)
3. How many years in work can I expect to make close to 100k?
4. Is it stressful?
5. Do you foresee remote work options to be acceptable/plentiful in the field?
6. How would you describe the work on a day to day basis?

Things that might help:

* I'm not passionate about CS, but I wasn't passionate about Finance... I'd be in it to finance the things I am passionate about (traveling on weekends w/o having to worry about money.. being able to hang out with friends after work.. etc.) - to me a job is a job, if it helps you live the life you want... I'll be happy
* Would be a steep learning curve in that I'm generally not cpu literate.. but tbf, I've never taken the time or had reason to venture into it deeply.
* I like to master/understand something. I'm not sure whether this kind of work would feel taxing in that you can never master it (?)

I know it's a bit much... any response would feel helpful!

Thnx"

1. How do I properly link Zerion to my Nano X? Do I need any wallets on my Zerion account before linking?

2. I know lots of DeFi is based on Ethereum - will I need to pay transaction fees in ETH to provide liquidity to Curve LPs even if the pools don’t comprise some % of ETH?

3. Similarly, do I need ETH to buy crypto index funds or can I use fiat/something else? Are there transactions fees associated w/buying and selling?"

- Must know your time horizon for investments
  - Short Term Investments – 1 year or less
  - Intermediate Term Investments – 2-5 years
  - Long Term Investments – 5 plus years
- Is the investment Liquid(stocks) or Illiquid (Real Estate)?
- Don&amp;#39;t buy preferred shares or convertible shares of stock. They have tax advantages that individual investors can&amp;#39;t get
- Derivative assets(futures) - derive their value from an underlying security or something else (very speculative)
- Stocks – you are the owner
- Bonds – you are the bank
- Short term securities – cash = principal is safe. Inflation risk still exists.
- Mutual Funds – managed on your behalf
- Stocks have historically done better than bonds but move up and down more (Do you want to eat well or do you want to sleep well?)
  - Stocks have a greater distribution range than bonds. IE – they up 30% one year and down 10% the next
  - Investment returns over time tend to mirror a normal distribution or &amp;quot;bell curve&amp;quot;
  - The greater the standard deviation, the wider the distribution of returns and the risker the investment. Stocks have wider distribution and more risk than bonds. But long term they provide a higher average return
- Don&amp;#39;t chase the next big thing. You will lose
- Don&amp;#39;t speculate
- Do NOT invest in an annuity
- Short Term Investments - Cash
  - 1 year or less
  - Usually Guaranteed
  - Very liquid
  - Low Risk-Low Return
  - Good place for emergency fund
  - Can lose purchasing power if they don&amp;#39;t keep up with inflation. Which they sometimes don&amp;#39;t
    - Common types
  - Savings accounts – stated rate of interest
  - Series EE savings bonds - Discount method – buy for $50 and redeem for $100 later.
  - Series I savings bonds – indexed to inflation
  - Treasury Bills – 1, 3 or 6-month maturity
  - Certificate of Deposit (CD) – have to be on deposit for a certain amount of time. From days to years. They usually rollover if you don&amp;#39;t stop them
  - Money Market Mutual Fund – mutual fund that invests only in short term securities. Unlike savings, they are not federally guaranteed but are considered risk free because other companies will bail them out in a problem
- Mutual Funds
  - Choose a family, not a fund
  - Professional money management and diversification
  - DCA – Dollar cost average is a great way to invest in mutual funds. You don&amp;#39;t worry what the market is doing or where it is going.
  - Don&amp;#39;t try to time the market. DCA!!!
  - Keep a long-term horizon and DCA
  - Most mutual fund investors BUY HIGH and SELL LOW. Don&amp;#39;t do this. Do not bail out of stocks when the market is down and buy on the way up. Most mutual fund investors do worse than the funds they invest in.
  - Choose a fund family and stick with them. Re-evaluate your investments once a year.
  - PITA (Pain in the A\*\*) factor is low
  - Fees
    - Management fee - Between 0.05% and 2% based on asset value
    - 12b-1 – &amp;quot;Advertisement fee&amp;quot; usually under 1%
    - Trading Cost – not disclosed in the prospectus. Look at the fund turnover. Higher turnover = higher trading costs. Lower turnover = lower trading costs
    - Load – charge a commission when the fund is bought. Paid to the financial representative. Usually 3-5%
      - A – front end load – paid upfront
      - B – back end load – paid when shares are sold
      - Deferred sales charge – ladder down then go to zero. 5,4,3,2,1
    - No Load – no commission when the fund is bought
      - No sales representative
      - 12b-1 Fee can&amp;#39;t be over 0.25%
      - I, F = don&amp;#39;t have a &amp;quot;load&amp;quot; but charge a &amp;quot;management fee&amp;quot; of usually 1-2%
      - Index funds are usually true no load funds – be careful because some 401K&amp;#39;s have index funds with very high fee

- REIT – Real Estate Investment Trust
  - Pass through investments that must distribute 95% of earnings to shareholders
  - Own various forms of real estate
  - Good long-term investment
  - No PITA factor unlike being a landlord
  - Very liquid
  - They are a hedge against inflation
  - No management concerns
  - Offer diversification
- Stocks
  - Allow general public ownership in a business
  - Historically the best return is in stocks
  - Very liquid
  - Primary Market – IPO&amp;#39;s – don&amp;#39;t get involved in this
  - Secondary Market – where most investors trade
  - Stay away from OTC (Over the Counter) markets
  - Bid (Sell) - Ask (Buy) – what they will buy or sell a security for. The market makers make the spread between the bid/ask and provide liquidity to the market
  - Don&amp;#39;t buy on margin
  - Don&amp;#39;t sell short
  - Dow Jones – price weighted index of 30 companies
  - S+P 500 – market cap weighted index of 500 companies
  - MSCI and EAFE – index of foreign companies
  - Stock spin off – conversion of a company&amp;#39;s subsidiaries into a standalone company
  - Stock split – increase in number of shares outstanding. IE 2 for 1. You had 100 shares at $10 but now you have 200 shares at $5
  - Share buyback – company buys back their own shares and this increases the EPS because you have less shares
  - Stocks can have different classes.
    - A – original shares
    - B, C, D, E, etc – companies can have different share classes that have different rights or benefits. IE – higher dividend, more votes, etc. look at what you are buying
  - You want cash dividends, not stock dividends

Valuation techniques

- Fundamental analysis of finance holds that the value of a stock is based on the present value of its future cash flows
- The worth of a company is primarily based on the earnings the company will produce in the future (difficult to predict)
- The most fundamental influence on stock prices is the level and duration of the future growth earnings and dividends. However, future earnings are dividends are NOT easily estimated even by professionals – Burton Malkiel
- There is no single financial ratio(P/E) that can summarize the general state of affairs of the company
- P/E ratio – current price of a company divided by the earnings per share. Industries tend to have certain P/E ratios. Some tend to have higher or lower P/E
- Historically P/E was supposed to match its growth rate. IE – 20% growth rate = 20 P/E. But P/E have been 100+ at times
- Growth stocks tend to have high P/E – must have very high earnings to justify
- Value stocks tend to have low P/E – doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean it is a good buy
- The P/E ratio tells you how long to earn back your investment back. IE – P/E 10 takes 10 years
- Price/Sales ratio (P/S) – same as P/E but you used sales instead of earnings. Usually used for fast growing companies who don&amp;#39;t have any earnings. Wall St. justified high prices on internet stocks during the late 90&amp;#39;s by using a P/S ratio
- Price/Book Ratio (P/B) – Book value is assets minus liabilities. P/B ratio is current price divided by book value.
- Price Ratio Analysis - Expected stock price =
  - 5-year average P/E or P/S or P/Cash Flow x Current EPS X (1 + EPS Growth Estimate)
  - The Price Ratio Analysis has not been very reliable analysis tool
- Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
  - Shares of a stock are valued on the basis of the present value of the future dividend streams the stock is projected to produce
  - This strategy worked very well during the 2001 downturn
  - Value of a stock = present value of all future dividend payments
  - Present value – the value today of a lump sum to be received at some future date
  - Different types of DDM
    - Zero Growth – assumes dividends will continue at a fixed rate indefinitely. Works well for stable income producing stocks
      - Take annual dividends and divide by required rate of return (you generate this number)
      - IE – Dividend of $3 a share and 6% required rate of return = $50 share value
      - Zero growth is another way to think about dividend yield
      - IE – Dividend divided by market price = rate of return
      - Example – Utility stock pays a $2.86 dividend. Current price is $75. If we want an 8% return take 2.86/0.08 = $35.75 – stock is overvalued based on our expected 8% return
      - You can also flip the formula to get what the market thinks the return is going to be. Take the dividend/price. 2.86/75 = 3.81%
    - Constant perpetual growth model – assumes dividends will grow at a specified rate perpetuity into the future. Good for companies with consistent dividend growth
      - Example – dividend of $10 per share and a 5% dividend growth rate. Required rate of return = 15%.
      - (10 x 1.05) / (15% - 5%) = 10.5 / 10% (0.1) = $105
      - 3M example - $230.37 per share. $5.44 dividend. Dividend growth 8%. Required rate of return 13%
      - (5.44 x 1.08) / (13 – 8) = 5.87 / 5% = $117.50 – overvalued based on example. But this formula is very susceptible to changes in required rate of return
    - The constant perpetual growth model is very sensitive to dividend growth and required return rates plugged into the formula
    - You can&amp;#39;t use DDM for a company that isn&amp;#39;t paying dividends
    - Dividend growth rates are very difficult to estimate. Unless you are looking at large cap, well established companies. But for smaller, faster growing companies in new industries, it is almost impossible
    - DDM – The value of a stock is based on the present value of its future cash flows
    - This strategy is good for prudent, long term investors
- The value line investment survey is a good place to get your information. You can get this information at some library&amp;#39;s.
- Doing all this math only tilts the odds in our favor. It doesn&amp;#39;t guarantee that it will work like we wanted. Ask yourself a simple question. Would I want to own this company if I had X dollars? That is the real question.
- There is no one financial ratio that tells you to buy or sell a stock
- Balance Sheet
  - Financial summary of firm&amp;#39;s assets, liabilities, and shareholders&amp;#39; equity
  - Assets – liabilities = shareholder equity
  - Current – Less than 1 year
  - Long Term – More than 1 year
- Income Statement
  - Financial summary of the operating results for a specified period
  - Revenue – expenses = income
- Cash Flow Statement
  - Financial summary of the cash flow of the company and other events
- Reports
  - 10K – annual
  - 10Q – quarterly
- Financial Ratios – remember there is no one ratio to consider
  - P/E – Price/Earnings
    - Most popular stock market ratio
    - Price/EPS
    - Tells you how long in years it will take the company to earn back its price. P/E of 5 = 5 years to earn back your investment
    - Look at competitor&amp;#39;s P/E ratio. Don&amp;#39;t just look at one number
    - The P/E ratio should approximately match the growth rate. PEG ratio of 1. Higher than 1 = P/E is higher than growth rate. Less than 1 = P/E is lower than growth rate. More than 1 is common now.
  - Dividend per share
    - Dividend/Number of shares outstanding
  - Dividend Yield
    - Dividend per share/market price
  - Dividend payout ratio – how much of the earnings are being paid out in dividends
    - Dividend per share/EPS
  - Book Value
    - Shareholders equity/Number of shares outstanding
    - It tells you the &amp;quot;liquid&amp;quot; value of the company if you sold off all the assets and paid off all the debts and paid off the shareholders. Many companies trade above book value because they are worth more intact than split up
  - Price to book value per share – tells an investor how far above the market value is above the book value
    - market price/book value
    - 3-4+ is not uncommon. IE – Book value of $5 and market value of $20
    - Less than 1 is bad because the company is in danger because raiders might try to take the company and sell off the assets
  - Price to cash flow and price to sales – don&amp;#39;t use these
    - A way to &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; companies without earnings. Many companies were valued with this during the internet boom of the late 90&amp;#39;s
- Profitability ratio
  - Net Profit Margin
    - Rate of profit earned after expenses and taxes.
    - Varies based on industry
    - Net Income/Total Revenue
  - Gross Profit Margin
    - Rate of profit earned from gross profit
    - Gross Profit/Total Revenue
  - Operating Margin
    - Rate of profit being earned from net income adjusting for non-cash items
    - Operating Income/Total Revenue
    - The higher the better with the profitability ratios. But check your competitors and see what is the normal for your industry
  - Return on assets (ROA)
    - Measures profitability relative to its total assets
    - Net Income/Total Assets
  - Return on equity (ROE)
    - Measure of the overall profitability of a company in relation to shareholders equity
    - Net Income/Total Stockholder equity
    - Return on equity is sensitive to the amount of debt a company carries. If a company carries more debt, it will have a higher ROE.
    - ROA and ROE can be drastically different, especially if a company carries lots of debt
- Liquidly Ratios
  - Current Ratio
    - Current Assets/Current Liabilities
    - Current ratio of 1.0 or higher is good. It means you have enough money to fund your short-term obligations. Higher number is better
- Leverage Ratios
  - Debt to equity ratio
    - Long-term debt/Total stockholder equity
    - A higher ratio means that the company is financing its growth with debt. The lower the number the better
- Sir Issac Newton – I can calculate the movement of the stars but not the madness of men
- Maynard Keynes – The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent
- From 1963-1998 the S+P 500 Index funds beat the active funds in 22 of the 36 years
- Many mutual funds have high expenses and high turnover rates. They also have a short time horizon. This makes it hard for them to beat the market.
- If you hear – BE CAREFUL!!!
  - It&amp;#39;s a new era
  - It&amp;#39;s different this time
  - The old ways of valuing stocks are gone
- Ben Graham – the investing public is incorrigible. It will buy anything, at any price, if there seems to be some action in progress.
- Mania&amp;#39;s will end with a crash every time.
- Ben Graham – Be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy
- John Templeton – Bear markets are born of pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy.
- Diversification – spreading your investments across asset classes to eliminate some, but not all risk
- Diversification – guarantees that some investments will not do well any given year. You have to look at the whole portfolio
- Cash has not been the top performer vs stocks or bonds in the last 25 years."

The survey “Customer experience in the financial sector” was carried out with the objective of understanding how the process of digitalization of communication has transformed the decision-making process of clients in the financial market. 

Overall, six out of ten customers would switch to a bank that offers a more seamless interaction experience. Consumers are fifteen times more likely to migrate from a bank because they do not believe in the credit granting protocols of their institutions.

Knowing this, Cointimes prepared an article exemplifying 5 situations in which you will not need a bank to solve your financial problems.

## 5 examples of what the Defi market can do 

The idea of [development of defi ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/decentralized-finance-defi-development) is to provide financial services, until then restricted to large financial institutions, to anyone, without having to ask for permission from banks, in a transparent manner and 24 hours a day.

With these innovations, it may no longer be necessary to deal with bank service dissatisfaction and denial of service.

### Loans

Can you imagine financing the car without having to queue at the bank or look at the manager's ugly face? These first Defi protocols that we are going to introduce allow you to get a loan with all the security of blockchain technology. 

AAVE and Compound are well-known decentralized financial projects that focus on cryptocurrency lending. Every trade is registered in a *smart contract* on the Ethereum blockchain, and it is only executed when all the agreed conditions are met. 

Aave and Compound create liquidity pools, which are nothing more than the surplus agents in a common financial system, that is, people who have no money and want to lend to someone earning interest as a reward. In this way, these protocols obtain funds to operationalize loans. 

### Decentralized Brokerage - DEXs

Decentralized brokers, DEXs, developed at Ethereum, offer investors a transparent and blockchain-based trading system, with less identification requirements (KYC), but with much more stable pricing, better experience and user interface (UX/UI ) and a much less frustrating trading experience.

Part of this was done through the use of shared liquidity pools and algorithmic pricing models. Uniswap, SushiSwap, Curve and 0x total more than 90% of all DEX traded volume.

### Insurance

For the nascent and pulsating market of cryptocurrencies, in which it is recommended that the individual will be his own bank and, therefore, will bear all the decisions and mistakes made, there is, of course, no Credit Guarantee Fund.

But the [development of DeFi](https://www.blockchainx.tech/decentralized-finance-defi-development) market, which concentrates the largest volumes of trading and innovation in the cryptoactives market, tried to get ahead and create two innovative businesses to meet this demand.

Nexus Mutual is a decentralized insurance protocol built on Ethereum that currently provides coverage for blockchain smart contracts.

Nexus Mutual includes smart contract failure coverage, which protects against potential bugs in the executed code and financial losses that can be incurred due to hacks or exploits in smart contract code.

After a failure in the smart contract, a Claims Assessment process will be carried out which will be evaluated by the Claims Assessors. Once approved, the Coverage Amount will be paid to the insured.

**Guarantee**

Maker Protocol (MKR) is a decentralized application that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Managed by the community itself, the protocol allows for the granting and taking of loans through stablecoin backed by dollar DAI (DAI).

With one shot, the protocol hit two holes. It allows loans in DAI and also backs the token in dollars, the dominant currency in the traditional financial system. Commonly used by investors who want to protect themselves from the volatility of cryptocurrencies. 

### Derivatives

A derivative is a financial contract between two or more parties based on the future price of an underlying asset. Derivatives are generally used to hedge risks or speculate on the price of the underlying asset in case of changes.

Synthetix is ​​an Ethereum-based protocol that opens up huge possibilities for the trillion-dollar derivatives market, but using decentralized finance or DeFi. It was released in 2017 under the name Havven (HAV), but after a year it was renamed to Synthetix 

**Conclusion**

According to Caio Borges, head of sales at Infobip in Brazil, ""The financial institution that manages to offer a better experience for the younger customer here in Brazil, will probably have more possibility of retaining them in the long term, when their purchasing power is greater"" .

However, if banks continue to leave customers unhappy, DEFI protocols can absorb more than 68% of their customers."

Nexus Mutual is a decentralized insurance protocol built on Ethereum that currently provides coverage for blockchain smart contracts.

Nexus Mutual includes smart contract failure coverage, which protects against potential bugs in the executed code and financial losses that can be incurred due to hacks or exploits in smart contract code.

After a failure in the smart contract, a Claims Assessment process will be carried out which will be evaluated by the Claims Assessors. Once approved, the Coverage Amount will be paid to the insured.

Maker Protocol (MKR) is a decentralized application that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Managed by the community itself, the protocol allows for the granting and taking of loans through stablecoin backed by dollar DAI (DAI).

With one shot, the protocol hit two holes. It allows loans in DAI and also backs the token in dollars, the dominant currency in the traditional financial system. Commonly used by investors who want to protect themselves from the volatility of cryptocurrencies. 

### Derivatives

A derivative is a financial contract between two or more parties based on the future price of an underlying asset. Derivatives are generally used to hedge risks or speculate on the price of the underlying asset in case of changes.

Synthetix is ​​an Ethereum-based protocol that opens up huge possibilities for the trillion-dollar derivatives market, but using decentralized finance or DeFi. It was released in 2017 under the name Havven (HAV), but after a year it was renamed to Synthetix 

**Conclusion**

According to Caio Borges, head of sales at Infobip in Brazil, ""The financial institution that manages to offer a better experience for the younger customer here in Brazil, will probably have more possibility of retaining them in the long term, when their purchasing power is greater"" .

However, if banks continue to leave customers unhappy, DEFI protocols can absorb more than 68% of their customers."
DeFi market is an alternative for 68% of Brazilians dissatisfied with banks,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFiBuzz/comments/p6mniv/defi_market_is_an_alternative_for_68_of/,yokesh351,1,2021-08-18 15:53:03,0,/r/DeFiBuzz/comments/p6mniv/defi_market_is_an_alternative_for_68_of/,NaN,"Almost seven (68%) out of ten Brazilians consider changing their bank to an institution with more consistent and efficient service, reveals a study carried out by Infobip, a global communication platform in the cloud, in partnership with the consultancy Frost &amp; Sullivan.

The survey “Customer experience in the financial sector” was carried out with the objective of understanding how the process of digitalization of communication has transformed the decision-making process of clients in the financial market. 

Overall, six out of ten customers would switch to a bank that offers a more seamless interaction experience. Consumers are fifteen times more likely to migrate from a bank because they do not believe in the credit granting protocols of their institutions.

Knowing this, Cointimes prepared an article exemplifying 5 situations in which you will not need a bank to solve your financial problems.

## 5 examples of what the Defi market can do 

The idea of [development of defi ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/decentralized-finance-defi-development) is to provide financial services, until then restricted to large financial institutions, to anyone, without having to ask for permission from banks, in a transparent manner and 24 hours a day.

With these innovations, it may no longer be necessary to deal with bank service dissatisfaction and denial of service.

### Loans

Can you imagine financing the car without having to queue at the bank or look at the manager's ugly face? These first Defi protocols that we are going to introduce allow you to get a loan with all the security of blockchain technology. 

AAVE and Compound are well-known decentralized financial projects that focus on cryptocurrency lending. Every trade is registered in a *smart contract* on the Ethereum blockchain, and it is only executed when all the agreed conditions are met. 

Aave and Compound create liquidity pools, which are nothing more than the surplus agents in a common financial system, that is, people who have no money and want to lend to someone earning interest as a reward. In this way, these protocols obtain funds to operationalize loans. 

### Decentralized Brokerage - DEXs

Decentralized brokers, DEXs, developed at Ethereum, offer investors a transparent and blockchain-based trading system, with less identification requirements (KYC), but with much more stable pricing, better experience and user interface (UX/UI ) and a much less frustrating trading experience.

Part of this was done through the use of shared liquidity pools and algorithmic pricing models. Uniswap, SushiSwap, Curve and 0x total more than 90% of all DEX traded volume.

"What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained",https://www.reddit.com/r/AltStreetBets/comments/p6w7i5/what_is_yield_farming_the_rocket_fuel_of_defi/,Wolf_Joe,1,2021-08-19 01:44:22,10,/r/AltStreetBets/comments/p6w7i5/what_is_yield_farming_the_rocket_fuel_of_defi/,Discussion," Yield farming was likely the greatest driver of the decentralized finance (Defi) explosion in 2020. Risk-tolerant investors saw the potential of yield farming and jumped at the chance to earn “free” interest with their cryptocurrencies. It isn’t exactly free, however, and the gains come with significant risk, depending on the project. While many farms are only profitable for a few weeks, we’ve compiled a list of the best yield farms for longer-term fee-earning.

The strategy uses the innovative technology of smart contracts, which in essence are automatically executing coded contracts that run on blockchains like Ethereum. Yield farming has grown as an investment strategy along with the technology that enables it. It can be risky, and scams are still part of the ecosystem, but the best platforms already have proven their worth. 

**What is Yield Farming?**

Yield farming is the popular strategy DeFi users take advantage of to put their cryptocurrencies to work to earn high interest. According to DeFiPulse, a DeFi analytics and ranking platform, DeFi protocols have over $50 billion worth of cryptocurrency locked in these programs. There are multiple types of yield farming projects offering different financial services, mostly to earn astonishingly high interest. Large banks might earn you 0.01% to 0.25% a year, but these sub-percent yields can’t compete with the 20% to 200% earnings some DeFi platforms tout. Often, the higher the interest, the riskier the staking pool is. Watch out for scams and unproven platforms that may lose you your money.  

**Yield Farming on Ethereum vs. Binance Smart Chain**

 Defi first erupted onto the cryptocurrency scene on the **Ethereum** network, but since then it has spread to other blockchains including Binance Smart Chain (BSC). **BSC** was launched by Binance Exchange in April 2019 to rival Ethereum. The Ethereum network has been struggling with high transaction fees caused by an increase in users and in computation needed to run the staggering number of complex Defi transactions. BSC is more centralized, which helps speed up transaction processing and dramatically lowers transaction fees compared to its rival. The Ethereum network charges these fees in Ether (ETH), and BSC charges them in Binance Coin (BNB).

The highest value DeFi platforms are on Ethereum (Aave, Curve, Uniswap, etc.), but BSC has enough large projects including PancakeSwap and Venus Protocol to compete with the Ethereum network. Ethereum-based platforms can only use Ether and other tokens built on Ethereum on its network, most of which are called ERC-20 tokens. BSC’s native token is BNB, and its platforms can use other tokens on the network (most called BEP-20 tokens). BSC is still cheaper to send transactions, but at the time of writing, Ethereum gas fees have dropped since DeFi became so popular. Now you can find some of the best yield farms on both chains.

**Best Yield Farms in 2021**

 

**1. Liquidity Providing on Uniswap**

 Uniswap is the second-largest decentralized exchange (DEX) behind Curve Finance by total value locked with more than $5.5 billion in the platform. The platform offers swaps with Ethereum and thousands of ERC-20 tokens and staking in liquidity pools to provide the swaps. Liquidity providers earn a percentage of trading fees for every swap, and with a large enough principle deposited, they earn significant interest. Interest rates on Uniswap and all other DEXes vary by the pool and market fluctuations.

Investors should be careful depositing assets in pools with volatile cryptos because drastic price changes could incur dramatic impermanent loss. Also, like on all DeFi platforms, smart contracts could fail, resulting in major losses. There are currently 2 main versions of the platform, Uniswap V2 and V3. 

**2. Aave**

 Aave is the reigning DeFi king in terms of total value locked with a staggering value of over $10 billion, according to DeFiPulse.com. Aave is a decentralized platform on Ethereum (and the Polygon sidechain) that offers low-interest cryptocurrency borrowing and lending. Because investors have deposited so much crypto into Aave to earn interest, its borrow APRs are some of the best on the market. Variable borrowing of stablecoins (like DAI, USDC and USDT) range from 3% APR to 7% at the time of writing. 

The unlikely possibility of smart contract failure is the main risk of depositing into Aave. Borrowers must consider the threat of liquidation when the ratio of the value of assets borrowed versus the value of the loan’s collateral rises above a threshold (called the maximum loan-to-value ratio) that varies between tokens. Anyone can buy up your collateral, and you could only recover up to 50% of the loan’s value.

 **3. PancakeSwap**

 PancakeSwap, like Uniswap, is a decentralized exchange (DEX). It functions similarly to Uniswap but is on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network instead of Ethereum and has a few more features focused on gamification. It holds the highest total value locked of all BSC DeFi projects by a mile at about $7 billion. PancakeSwap offers BSC token swaps, interest-earning staking pools, a gambling game where users predict the future price of BNB and even non-fungible token (NFT) art. 

**4. ZooKeeper**

 Zookeeper will provide a dual farming experience while embracing the popular crypto trend of NFTs. The project will complement another existing Wanchain Dapp: Wanswap (www.wanswap.finance); thus greatly augmenting liquidity. However, Zookeeper will have its own utility token ($ZOO) distributed as farming rewards to Wanswap Liquidity Providers (LPs), who stake their WSLP (Wan Swap Liquidity Provider tokens).

All this makes ZooKeeper a unique gamified yield farming Dapp with profit potential and gaming fun.

 

**Yield Farming Versus Holding Crypto**

Yield farming is so popular because cryptocurrency investors want exposure to their favorite investments while earning interest at the same time. In safe yield farms and liquidity pools, this can be a great strategy. However, the gains from these opportunities and the principle investment aren’t completely safe in yield-farming platforms. Smart contract failures, scams and impermanent losses have cost investors hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto investments. Beware of ludicrously high interest estimates, and always vet DeFi platforms before investing.

What am I looking for?

You: Someone that is intelligent. Someone that has a bit of an ego and can back it up. Just be prepared to have your ego put into check. I love being teased. And I hope you do too. If we were walking down the street together you would find ways to gently touch me or inadvertently brush your arm against my body. I would catch you glancing at my breasts or checking out my butt. Your hand would rest on the small of my back, hovering right above the curve of my bottom.

You like to rile me up in playful arguments and I know better but I still argue with you anyway.

I am independent. Don’t feel like you need to let me be. I like to be guided and controlled from time to time. I’ll fight you on it but I’m okay with you asserting your dominance. Be possessive. Be jealous. Be open with me. Be loving. Be doting. Be honest. Be charming, witty, and kind.

Have a career. Be a professional. In college, I used to fall for the engineering guys. Not sure why lol might have been the egos or the mutual STEM background. Take active care of yourself. No beer bellies, burger bellies, or dad bods, please. Be child-free as I do not have children.

You don’t have to be an avid reader but I would like to discuss literature at some point as I am a voracious reader. I would like to be able to share books!

Me: I am 5’6 of average build and moderate shape, if that makes sense? Lol I am a olive-skinned but on the paler side. I do have a booty. It’s there. Can’t help it lol. I have long dark brown /light brown hair (depending on the season and my sun exposure lol). Features that people typically comment on – my eyes, my smile, my hair, my legs, my butt and strangely enough, my feet. I have had men speed walk, stride for stride, to ask me out because of my “smile and energy”. Men will approach me, stare at me, and occasionally buy me drinks while I’m out with friends or my significant other.

I am kind. I am generous. I am giving. I love to smile. So much so that I have smile lines and crinkles around my eyes. I am warm. I am direct and I’m not afraid to speak my mind. I am playful and silly. I find hilarity in dry humor. Music is always on my mind. So many of my memories are associated with music! Music preference ranges from Hilary Duff (lol) to Snarky Puppy to Chicago to Elton John. I am currently on a Juanes kick right now.  I often joke that I have a soundtrack in my head to go with my day or mood. I love tennis and getting outdoors! But also shopping lol. I have two cats, I bake, I love Friends, Schitts Creek, and Legally Blonde. I promise my movie and tv choices are more eclectic than that. I work in a STEM field and have a deep interest in all aspects of health. If you make time for me, I can most definitely make time for you. Mutual attraction is important to me as is intellectual stimulation so please include a photo.

Can’t wait to meet you! :)"

It isn't due until mid-December, and so I know I have plenty of time but it was so disheartening when I went to tackle it today. Even if I tried to follow Medium or other articles I was still running into issues. I just seemed to have gotten error after error and no clue why or how to sort it out. Maybe I shouldn't rely heavily on other codes and see if I can do my own thing from the ground up. I got as far as downloading the data, but everything I thought I knew about Python just didn't seem to help me. When will I use fuzzbuzz?!

One good thing, I suppose, is I was able to find a script that downloaded the tickers for all the constituent S&amp;P500 stocks so that I don't have to type them all out. 

I don't know. It'll be a learning curve but I'm excited to practise. I really do adore using Python - one of my lecturers has written a MatLab script I can use for the first half of the dissertation (I am doing it on pairs trading) but there's a very large part of me that wants to work this out myself. 

Sorry if this isn't the place, just wanted a little vent.

As the title states, I just discovered that my exact job was posted on my company job portal, LinkedIn, Indeed, etc. 

I have been working on a very small team (5 people) in a Fortune 500 company for 7 months now. I am in shock with this discovery and feel completely blindsided. I think it’s safe to assume the team is looking to replace me as I haven’t been informed of any new additions. Would you all agree? If so, what is your suggested course of action, aside from immediately job hunting. Do I politely confront my manager? Do I resign prior to being terminated? I have a healthy emergency fund so I would be comfortable resigning and disqualifying myself from receiving unemployment benefits, if resignation would be more advantageous. If/when the time does come, what are major do’s and dont’s? I intend to be as professional as possible, despite the unfortunate circumstance. 

For context, it is a relatively technical role within the finance department that entails a “deep learning curve”. I get along very well with the team and have not received any “negative” feedback, although I am certainly still learning. When I was hired, my manager warned me that it will likely take 1-1.5 years before I am fully comfortable with the role. 

Thank you all in advance.

Edit: not sure how relevant this is, but Indeed shows that the job was posted 28 days ago, while the respective LinkedIn post is from 7 days ago

Edit 2: a follow up question that I have been thinking about: Is it common for companies to recruit replacements prior to a vacancy? A friend of mine said that his company required a position to be vacant before they posted it. Anyone have experience with this?"

Alright, let’s get to it. For the last few months I’ve been chasing yields across the polygon network ever since AAVE and Curve Finance made the migration in the spring. Since then the ecosystem has been b-o-o-m-i-n-g. It should be noted here that not all DeFi protocols are made equally, and for this reason my recommendations are skewed more towards blue-chip protocols that have been through extensive security audits and have a history of safe operation while managing millions/billions of dollars. But I’m not one to stifle innovation, so I’ll make sure to include some up-and-coming protocols for the more risk-tolerant degens out there. Also, like many of you, I chose to avoid USDT (ew) as much as possible, and this guide will reflect that.

# 1. The Bridge:

In order to move funds from Ethereum to the Polygon network, I recommend using the Polygon (Matic) POS bridge. This process usually costs around $10 and takes about 10-15 mins. You can transfer a variety of coins, including Matic, Eth, USDC, and DAI - [https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/)

Keep in mind that it will cost more to move your funds back using the bridge (usually around $30-$50). I know this can seem a bit discouraging (and terrifying) but the process is relatively simple and if you commit to keeping your stablecoins on the network it will pay off the fees in a matter of months.

I know there are new methods and alternatives popping up everyday, so keep an eye out for cheaper ways to bridge funds to the network. More exchanges are also beginning to offer direct onboarding options.

# 2. STABLECOINS:

I'll focus primarily on:

USDC

DAI (Maker Protocol)

FRAX

MUSD (Mstable)

UST

miMATIC (Mai Finance)

PUSD (PolyQuity)

&amp;#x200B;

*Where to swap them?*

\-**Curve Finance** and **Mstable** have good stablecoin swap rates.

\-And everything can also be swapped for the best rates using **1inch**. Seriously. It’s amazing. (this will be better than using **Quickswap**, but with a more limited selection of coins)

\-miMATIC and PUSD are over collateralized stable coins minted from crypto vaults on **Mai Finance** (they accept Matic, Link, Ethereum, and Curve for minting) and **PolyQuity** (they only accept Matic) You can also just swap for them. MiMATIC is available anywhere (so use 1inch) and PUSD is only available for trading on SushiSwap. 

# 3. DEFI PROTOCOLS

Finally, the fun part. Here is a quick overview list of what I’ll be touching on that the Matic network has to offer. Remember, has fee’s are DIRT cheap here, which means this is a great place to experiment.

**-AAVE**

[https://app.aave.com/markets](https://app.aave.com/markets)

USDC, DAI, or USDT - (4-6% average including WMATIC rewards)

**-Curve Finance**

[https://polygon.curve.fi/](https://polygon.curve.fi/)

DAI-USDT-USDC pool - about 10% (includes WMATIC &amp; CURVE rewards) - uses AAVE for yield - you could also take this LP and deposit it into a yield aggregator on this list for extra returns) \*This pool includes exposure to USDT.

**-Mstable**

[https://app.mstable.org/#/musd/save](https://app.mstable.org/#/musd/save)

USDC, DAI, USDT, FRAX - save pool, currently 30.60% APY (includes 16.48% WMATIC and 10.84% MTA rewards)

Mstable has also just currently set up it’s new pool function in partnership with **Frax Finance**. This pool returns about 20%-60% APY but includes lockup periods for higher returns):

[https://app.frax.finance/staking#mStable\_FRAX\_mUSD](https://app.frax.finance/staking#mStable_FRAX_mUSD)

**-Stake Dao**

[https://stakedao.org/](https://stakedao.org/)

am3CRV (curve stablecoin pool LP) - 25.64% APY

This is a great way to yield extra return on the Curve Finance stablecoin pool. This involves more moving parts and thus higher risk. (You are relying on AAVE, CURVE, and StakeDao to remain intact)

\-**Balancer**

[https://polygon.balancer.fi/#/](https://polygon.balancer.fi/#/)

USDC, DAI, USDT, miMATIC pool - 18% APR (paid out weekly on Wednesdays - includes MATIC/Balancer rewards)

**Cream Finance**

[https://app.cream.finance/](https://app.cream.finance/)

USDC - 9% APY

DAI - 10% APY

(These rates change based on the balance of deposits/loans on the protocol and may not be as consistent as other options here) Also, it looks like CREAM just added Frax to the protocol, so keep an eye out for future rates.

**Pickle Finance**

[https://app.pickle.finance/](https://app.pickle.finance/)

DAI - 22.49% APY (includes PICKLE and MATIC rewards)

am3CRV (Curve LP) - 20% APY (includes PICKLE and MATIC rewards)

miMATIC-USDC (Quickswap LP) - 31.23% APY (includes PICKLE and MATIC rewards)

**Kyber Network (DMM Swap)**

[https://dmm.exchange/#/farms](https://dmm.exchange/#/farms)

USDC-DAI (Kyber LP) - 18.38% APY (includes KNC rewards) - note that these rewards are vested over a 30 day period after claiming. Also, these rewards are ending in about 2 weeks, but who knows, maybe there will be more to come in the future.

**Quickswap**

[https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap)

USDC-miMATIC (Quickswap LP) - 16.43% APY (rewards paid in QUICK)

I recommend taking this LP and throwing it into a yield aggregate like Pickle Finance for maximum returns!) Also, quickstep offers a range of other stablecoin pools, but I will not be covering them because they do not compete with the returns of most of the other protocols here)

**Sushiswap**

[https://app.sushi.com/farm](https://app.sushi.com/farm)

USDC-FRAX (sushiswap LP) - 16.02% APR (rewards paid in SUSHI and WMATIC)

**Apeswap**

[https://app.apeswap.finance/yield](https://app.apeswap.finance/yield)

USDC-DAI (Apeswap LP) - 17.23% APR / 19.85% APY (Rewards include BANANA and WMATIC)

**PoolTogether**

[https://app.pooltogether.com/](https://app.pooltogether.com/)

USDT (single pool) - 12.84% APR in WMATIC (and daily opportunity to win lottery prize.

**Mai Finance**

[https://app.mai.finance/farm](https://app.mai.finance/farm)

USDC-miMATIC (Quick LP) - 26.27% APR (Rewards paid in QI)

Note that this pool includes a 0.5% deposit fee (gotta commit to it)

**DFYN**

[https://exchange.dfyn.network/#/popular-farms](https://exchange.dfyn.network/#/popular-farms)

UST-USDT (Dyfn LP) - 36.64% APR (Rewards in DFYN)

DAI-USDC (defy LP) - 26.16% APR (Rewards in DFYN)

Please note that DFYN has a complex rewards / vesting schedule. Make sure to read it over before depositing to any pools/farms.

**BarnBridge**

[https://app.barnbridge.com/smart-yield/markets](https://app.barnbridge.com/smart-yield/markets)

Barnbridge is in the process of releasing incentivized rewards for their stablecoin pools (USDC, DAI, USDT) I’m not sure when they will come, but it’s possibly something to keep an eye out for.

**bZx Protocol (Torque.Loans / Fulcrum trading)**

[https://polygon.fulcrum.trade/lend](https://polygon.fulcrum.trade/lend)

USDC - 6.41% APR

USDT - 8.84% APR

These interest bearing tokens can also be deposited into vaults at Autofarm to increase yield (13%-18% APY) -[https://autofarm.network/polygon/59/](https://autofarm.network/polygon/59/)

&amp;#x200B;

# MY FAVORITES:

So far Mstable has the best yield-to-safety ratio for me (read about how MTA is sacrificed if USDT fails). I also love Pickle Finance for the single DAI pool, and Autofarm (or Beefy Finance: [https://polygon.beefy.finance/](https://polygon.beefy.finance/) ) for optimizing LP yields from other protocols. You sure can build a lot of setups with these money Legos.

Alright, that’s it. I’ve spent a whole hour away from staring at the charts and the withdrawals are setting in. If I’ve gotten anything horribly wrong or left out anyone’s favorite protocol feel free to leave a comment below.

It ain’t much, but it’s honest work.

Ray Dalio Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises Part 1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/p8ikpm/ray_dalio_principles_of_navigating_big_debt/,captmorgan50,9,2021-08-21 09:43:39,4,/r/Gold/comments/p8ikpm/ray_dalio_principles_of_navigating_big_debt/,NaN,"# **Ray Dalio**

# **Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises**

-	Policy makers have 4 levers to pull when dealing with debt
  - Austerity
  - Debt defaults/Restructurings
  - Central Bank printing money &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot;
  - Transfers of money and credit
-	The first 2 are deflationary and the latter 2 are inflationary. Which levers the policy makers pull determine who benefits and who suffers. This process is painful for everyone
-	**Template of a debt crisis**
-	Typically occur because debt and debt service costs rise faster than the incomes needed to service that debt
  - Usually, a central bank can alleviate typical debt crises by lowering interest rates, but severe crises occur when that is no longer possible. IE - 0% interest rates
  - Classically, a lot of short-term debt cycles leads to a long-term debt cycle.
-	Long term debt cycles are just bigger versions of short-term debt cycles
-	During the upswing, credit is freely available and people are willing to take on more risk
-	Credit is cut during a crisis. Asset prices fall, debtors have trouble servicing debt, investors get scared and cautious which leads to liquidity problems
-	Deflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by the local currency
-	Inflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by foreign currency
-	Positive effects of debt cycles come first; negative come later
-	Typically, the worst debt bubbles are not accompanied by high and rising inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth
  - This is because policymakers make the mistake of accommodating debt growth because they are focused on inflation and/or growth, not on debt growth itself, the asset inflations they are producing, and whether or not debts will be able to be serviced
-	It is the tightening of monetary policy that usually pops a bubble
-	No specific event or shock caused the stock market bubble to burst in 1929
-	During a severe economic downturn, protectionist/populist policies begin to rise and outrage over the governments role in &amp;quot;bailing out&amp;quot; financial institutions
-	Once policymakers shift their attention to increasing financial regulation and oversight, that typically signals the of the big debt cycle
-	It is typically the case that the first tightening or policy does not hurt stocks and the economy
-	By 1937, all currencies had all devalued a lot against Gold, but not so much against each other
-	Gold bullion is the only asset that has no counterparty risk

# **Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle**

-	Early – Debt is not growing faster than incomes. Debt is financing activities that produce growth. Known as &amp;quot;Goldilocks&amp;quot; period
-	Bubble – Debt is rising faster than incomes and this produces strong asset returns and growth. This process is generally self-reinforcing because it allows people to borrow more. This can go on for decades. These are short term cycles but lots of them adding up can lead to a long-term debt cycle
  - Usually start from Bull markets. Lower interest rates drive asset prices higher, which leads to economic growth and the ability to take on more debt
  - Lending standards are reduced as people and business lever up
  - Lenders and speculators make lots of fast/easy money which reinforces the bubble
  - As a bubble nears the top of the cycle, the economy is the most vulnerable, but people are feeling the wealthiest and the most bullish
  - The Boom encourages new speculators into the market further driving up prices
  - Humans by nature tend to move in crowds and weight recent experiences more heavily. This causes people to extrapolate too much from the recent past in both up and down markets
  - Central banks usually target inflation or inflation/growth and don&amp;#39;t target the management of bubbles, the debt growth they enable can go on to finance the creation of bubbles. And the bursting of bubbles can cause severe economic pain
  - Don&amp;#39;t only look at one metric to serve as an indicator of a debt crisis
  - Monetary policy, in many cases, helps inflate the bubble rather than constrain it
    - How to Spot a Bubble
      - Prices are high relative to traditional measures
      - Broad bullish sentiment
      - Purchases are financed by high leverage
      - New buyers enter the market
      - Buyers make very forward purchases to speculate or protect themselves from future price gains
      - Stimulative monetary policy reinflates the bubble and tight monetary policy contributes to its popping
-	The Top – prices have been driven by a lot of leveraged buying and the market gets fully long, leveraged, and overpriced, it becomes rip for reversal
  - Most often occurs when the central bank starts to tighten and interest rates rise for whatever reason
  - This causes a debt service squeeze and hurts asset prices. Which reduces the amount of money lenders are willing to lend out as they become cautious
  - Investors move from risk assets to less risky assets slowing down growth
  - A negative &amp;quot;wealth effect&amp;quot; occurs when one&amp;#39;s wealth declines, which leads to less lending and spending. This is due to both negative psychology and financial condition
  - Yield curve is usually flat or inverted
    - People are incentivized to move into cash just before the crash which itself slows down lending
  - Unemployment is low
  - The more leverage that exists and the higher the prices, the less tightening it takes to prick the bubble and the bigger the bust that follows
    - Immediate post bubble period
    - People mistakenly judge the decline to be a buying opportunity and find &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; stocks failing to see that earning are likely to decline much more. They extrapolate too much from the recent past
    - Wealth falls first and incomes fall later, creditworthiness worsens, which constricts lending activity, this hurt spending and lowers investments and makes borrowing more difficult
    - As asset prices fall, the lenders tighten lending standards which hurts spending and investment
    - This causes people to sell investments to raise cash which causes more driving down of prices and is a self-reinforcing cycle
-	The &amp;quot;Depression&amp;quot;
  - In a normal recession, cutting interest rates can stimulate the economy. But in a depression, rates can&amp;#39;t be cut because they are already at 0%
  - The central banks have to go to alternative ways to stimulate the economy. IE – &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or printing money or stimulus
  - Declines of 50% of people&amp;#39;s assets are common
  - As the depression begins, defaults and restructurings hit the various people. Especially leveraged ones (Banks)
  - Runs on banks are common
  - At this stage of the cycle, debt defaults and austerity dominate which are deflationary
  - People financial condition worsens, which makes lenders more reluctant to loan money. Which slows down the economy
  - Usually, institutions and policymakers have learned from the past, but not every depression is the same as before and this catches them off guard. It doesn&amp;#39;t tend to play out like the last one that they are defending against
  - If the central bank prints money to alleviate the credit shortage, it can cause inflation if not careful
  - A big part of this deleveraging process is that people discover that much of what they thought they of as wealth was simply other people promises to give them money. And now those promises are not being kept and that wealth isn&amp;#39;t real
  - Fear cascades through the system, and these fears feed on themselves and lead to a scramble for cash that results in a shortage (investors sell assets)
  - The depression phase is dominated by deflationary forces of debt reduction
  - The investor class experiences a tremendous loss of &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; wealth, and as a result, they become extremely defensive, they seek safety in liquid investments like bonds, gold or cash
  - The 4 options policymakers have for dealing with the depression
    - They are typically slow to react initially because they don&amp;#39;t want to bail out the people who got themselves into problems
    - Austerity – Usually the most obvious thing to do. But it doesn&amp;#39;t bring the debt and income into balance. Government revenues fall and demands for government services rise which cause deficits to rise and subsequent rise in taxes. All this is bad
    - &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or Printing Money – The moves come in progressively larger doses as more modest initial attempts to rectify the imbalances fail. However, those early efforts typically produce bear market rallies
    - Debt defaults/Restructurings – You have to clean out the bad debt so the flow of money can continue to return to prosperity.
    - Redistribute the Wealth – Wealth gaps increase during bubbles and they become glaring during the hard times. Political populism tends to take hold after this time period. Taxes on the rich become common talking points. Central bank purchases of assets disproportionally help the rich
    - Stocks usually fall 50%
    - Currency devaluation will usually be 50% against gold
    - Deficits widen to 6% of GDP
    - Economic activity falls about 10%
    - Unemployment is 10-15%
    - Aggressive stimulation usually occurs about 2-3 years into a depression
-	The &amp;quot;Beautiful Deleveraging&amp;quot;
  - Happens when the policymakers move the 4 levers in a balanced way
  - Printing money during this phase doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily cause inflation. It won&amp;#39;t if its offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces. If income is growing faster than debt, you will be ok. However, if debt is growing faster than income, you can have a problem.
  - But central bankers can abuse the stimulative policy&amp;#39;s and cause a &amp;quot;ugly inflationary deleveraging&amp;quot; IE – Weimer Germany in the 1920&amp;#39;s
  - Printing money and debt monetization/government guarantees are inevitable in depressions in which interest rate cuts won&amp;#39;t work (IE – Already at 0%)
  - All the deleveraging eventually led to big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits, and currency devaluations (against gold, commodities, and stocks)
  - In the end, policy makers always print money because it is the easiest
    - Austerity causes more pain than benefit
    - Big restructuring wipes out too much wealth too fast
    - Redistributing of sufficient size doesn&amp;#39;t happen without a revolution
-	Pushing on a string phase
  - Late in the cycle, the policy makers have to be careful because their stimulative policies effects have diminished.
  - Economy usually enters a low growth and low return of assets
  - The danger of this phase is that too much money printing and subsequent devaluation can cause a &amp;quot;ugly inflationary deleveraging&amp;quot; to occur
    - Monetary Policy 1
      - Usually try to lower interest rates first. If that doesn&amp;#39;t work, they go to 2
    - Monetary Policy 2
      - &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or printing money and buying financial assets. But over time, QE&amp;#39;s ability to stimulate the market is reduced as asset prices are high and risk premiums are low. IE – investors don&amp;#39;t want to buy expensive assets that are projected to have low returns. Investors move into cash for protection which makes further QE less and less effective
      - Sometimes at this phase, policy makers monetize debt in even larger quantities in an attempt to compensate for QE reduced effectiveness. This may provide a short-term boost but there is a real risk that prolonged monetization will lead people to question the currency&amp;#39;s suitability as a store of value. This can cause investors to rush to safe havens like Gold
      - At some point, low interest rates and low premiums on risk assets from monetary policy 2 don&amp;#39;t work anymore and policy makers look to Monetary Policy 3 to stimulate the economy
    - Monetary Policy 3 – Where the US is at in 2020
      - Puts money directly into the hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and incentivizes them to spend it
      - Government provides direct or indirect stimulus payments in many different forms
-	Normalization
  - System gets back to normal. But this usually takes 5-10 years and economic activity is slow during this time frame. And it takes investors a very long time to get comfortable taking the risk of holding equities again

# **Inflationary Depression**

-	Reserve currency countries that don&amp;#39;t have significant foreign currency debt can have inflationary depressions, they usually emerge more slowly and later in the process, after sustained and repeated overuse of stimulus to reverse a deflationary deleveraging.
-	If a reserve-currency country permits much higher inflation in order to keep growth stronger by printing lots of money, it can further undermine demand for the currency, erode its reserve currency status (IE make investors view it less as a store of wealth) and turn its deleveraging into an inflationary one"
"Understand more about IDOs, the new ways to finance crypto projects",https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/p8m2zj/understand_more_about_idos_the_new_ways_to/,yokesh351,0,2021-08-21 13:53:08,2,/r/btc/comments/p8m2zj/understand_more_about_idos_the_new_ways_to/,NaN,"What is an IDO?

An initial decentralized finance offering (IDO) is a method for launching tokens using automated market makers (AMMs) from decentralized brokers (DEXs) such as Uniswap on the Ethereum network .

IDOs are also called “Initial Listings on Uniswap”, “Initial 'farming' offers” and “Initial 'Pools' offers”, although “Initial DeFi Offer” or “IDO” are the most commonly used terms.

DEXs like uniswap offer specific advantages for projects to raise funds through sales of tokens, including listings apermissionadas - i.e. allow anyone to participate and interact.

There are two types of contracts that are part of Uniswap's trading engine Exchange contracts (or “exchange contracts”) have a pool of a specific token and a counterparty with which users can convert tokens.

Factory contracts manage the creation of new exchange contracts and register new addresses of standard ERC-20 tokens to the Uniswap registry.

zand its clones, such as PancakeSwap , from Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

*What are tokens?*

There are no listing fees or verification processes for adding tokens at Uniswap. Instead, any user can request the manufacturing contract to register a new token.

A user who wants to add a token uses a function called “create exchange” (or “create exchange”), which involves registering the address for an ERC-20 token for which a user wants to create a market.

The function makes the exchange contract check the Uniswap registry to see if a contract already exists for that token. If no exchange contract for the token is listed, the manufacturing contract creates an exchange contract and registers the new ERC-20 token.

Liquidity pool platforms such as Uniswap are increasingly becoming the system of choice for distributing this new class of DeFi tokens, and the volume traded on these DEXs soared in 2020 and 2021.

## The Advantage of Token Token On A DEX Automated Market Maker

Automated market making brokers (or AMMs) don't use trade books like traditional brokers — where buyers are connected with individual sellers. Instead, brokers such as Uniswap use an alternative method to settle trades in cryptocurrencies.

Rather than forming a pair of buyers and sellers, tokens are bought and sold at a rate determined by a bonding curve .

With this mechanism, tokens are acquired if the price goes up, and as tokens are sold, the price goes down. In both cases, the exchange rate is determined by a supply curve rather than a market with offers made by buyers and sellers.

Foreign exchange contracts contain a pool of specific ERC-20 tokens and a counterparty token (such as ETH, USDC etc.). If there is a supply of both tokens, a trade can take place with an automatically generated price based on supply and demand.

The user does not have to worry about connecting with another trader to exchange or specify a price.

Since price and counterparties do not need to be considered and trading takes place automatically, launching a project via an IDO or an AMM from a DEX is an easier process to raise capital than other token offer models such as initial offers for currencies (ICOs) and brokerage initial offers (IEOs) .

## ICOs x IDOs

With the [development of Initial Coin Offerings](https://www.blockchainx.tech/ico-development) (ICOs) model, popularized between 2017 and 2018, projects performed token sales through a website, where custody and token transfers were based on trust, not stand-alone contracts or pre-fabricated infrastructure , such as Uniswap.

This required the development and management of a centralized website just to make the sale.

When the sale was made, another big difference with the ICO model was that, after the launch sale ended, projects still needed to find a broker or a secondary market to trade their tokens.

This was problematic for projects financed via ICO, as most of the most popular crypto brokers charged between tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to integrate a new token.

Listing at several centralized brokerages required gaining access so that a sufficient number of active investors would integrate sufficient liquidity for trading pairs. It was an expensive and time-consuming experience.

With IDOs, a trading market is created at the same time a token is released, as the creation of secondary markets is automatic and allowed in decentralized AMMs.

This results in an active market for trading and liquidity immediately accessible to participants after the initial sale of the token — solving problems such as liquidity and price uncertainty.

ICOs were primarily applied via Ethereum's ERC-20 protocol standard and quickly became the most popular use case on the network. They were an essential factor in the price increase of ether ( ETH ) in 2017.

Investors who wanted to access exclusive business flow opportunities needed to accumulate ether to participate in ICOs.

It also resulted in new users and transaction activity on the Ethereum blockchain, creating a positive feedback loop that boosted the price of the cryptocurrency.

IDOs, as well as ICOs, also played a role in propelling ether's price during the most recent uptrend. Tokens released through IDOs offer aggressive yields similar to ICOs and have users creating Ethereum accounts and transacting on the network.

It's important to mention that there are other factors behind the ether price boost, including the growing DeFi and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) sectors and a growth in interoperability between blockchains , allowing new projects to connect to Ethereum.

But this time, the token offering craze is spreading to other blockchain platforms — most notably Binance Smart Chain (BSC) .

At the first big IDO on Uniswap, UMA , on April 23, the price of ether had risen by 2,227%. Since the first big IDO on PancakeSwap, BLINk , on November 20, the price of the binance coin ( BNB ) has risen by 2.313%.

## The next step for IDOs: token pools and settlement curves with checks

Another evolution of IDO came with the launch of IDO-specific platforms such as Polkastarter , BCS starter and Samurai .

What differentiates token releases on these platforms from token releases on Uniswap and PancakeSwap is the verification process for the listing of tokens on these platforms.

At Polkastarter, for example, the application process is overseen by Polastarter's staff and board, which includes members from Huobi , Polygon , Alchemy and other investors and entrepreneurs.

BSCstarter is a decentralized funding platform for [Binance Smart Chain ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/bep20-token-development)protocols. It sets itself apart from other launch platforms in that it is completely community-governed.

It has few compliance requirements for projects aiming to join this community. Instead, it opts for a system where the BSCstarter community determines which projects are worth listing using its collective audit and its own surveys.

The system leverages the prudence of the contribution concept so that it is the verification of possibly unfavorable projects.

Anyone can sign up on BSCstarter to launch a token on the platform. After submitting the request, a presales contract is generated based on the token design rule.

Community members who have a specific balance of START , the native token of BSCstarter, will have the opportunity to audit submitted projects. They can vote “yes” or “no” and, when a vote is sent, it cannot be changed.

Projects that receive more “yes” votes than “no” votes and receive at least 10% of the total START token supply as a “yes” vote will receive approval to begin their sale."

An initial decentralized finance offering (IDO) is a method for launching tokens using automated market makers (AMMs) from decentralized brokers (DEXs) such as Uniswap on the Ethereum network .

IDOs are also called “Initial Listings on Uniswap”, “Initial 'farming' offers” and “Initial 'Pools' offers”, although “Initial DeFi Offer” or “IDO” are the most commonly used terms.

DEXs like uniswap offer specific advantages for projects to raise funds through sales of tokens, including listings apermissionadas - i.e. allow anyone to participate and interact.

There are two types of contracts that are part of Uniswap's trading engine Exchange contracts (or “exchange contracts”) have a pool of a specific token and a counterparty with which users can convert tokens.

Factory contracts manage the creation of new exchange contracts and register new addresses of standard ERC-20 tokens to the Uniswap registry.

zand its clones, such as PancakeSwap , from Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

*What are tokens?*

There are no listing fees or verification processes for adding tokens at Uniswap. Instead, any user can request the manufacturing contract to register a new token.

A user who wants to add a token uses a function called “create exchange” (or “create exchange”), which involves registering the address for an ERC-20 token for which a user wants to create a market.

The function makes the exchange contract check the Uniswap registry to see if a contract already exists for that token. If no exchange contract for the token is listed, the manufacturing contract creates an exchange contract and registers the new ERC-20 token.

Liquidity pool platforms such as Uniswap are increasingly becoming the system of choice for distributing this new class of DeFi tokens, and the volume traded on these DEXs soared in 2020 and 2021.

## The Advantage of Token Token On A DEX Automated Market Maker

Automated market making brokers (or AMMs) don't use trade books like traditional brokers — where buyers are connected with individual sellers. Instead, brokers such as Uniswap use an alternative method to settle trades in cryptocurrencies.

Rather than forming a pair of buyers and sellers, tokens are bought and sold at a rate determined by a bonding curve .

With this mechanism, tokens are acquired if the price goes up, and as tokens are sold, the price goes down. In both cases, the exchange rate is determined by a supply curve rather than a market with offers made by buyers and sellers.

Foreign exchange contracts contain a pool of specific ERC-20 tokens and a counterparty token (such as ETH, USDC etc.). If there is a supply of both tokens, a trade can take place with an automatically generated price based on supply and demand.

The user does not have to worry about connecting with another trader to exchange or specify a price.

Since price and counterparties do not need to be considered and trading takes place automatically, launching a project via an IDO or an AMM from a DEX is an easier process to raise capital than other token offer models such as initial offers for currencies (ICOs) and brokerage initial offers (IEOs) .

DEXs like uniswap offer specific advantages for projects to raise funds through sales of tokens, including listings apermissionadas - i.e. allow anyone to participate and interact.

There are two types of contracts that are part of Uniswap's trading engine Exchange contracts (or “exchange contracts”) have a pool of a specific token and a counterparty with which users can convert tokens.

Factory contracts manage the creation of new exchange contracts and register new addresses of standard ERC-20 tokens to the Uniswap registry.

zand its clones, such as PancakeSwap , from Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

*What are tokens?*

There are no listing fees or verification processes for adding tokens at Uniswap. Instead, any user can request the manufacturing contract to register a new token.

A user who wants to add a token uses a function called “create exchange” (or “create exchange”), which involves registering the address for an ERC-20 token for which a user wants to create a market.

The function makes the exchange contract check the Uniswap registry to see if a contract already exists for that token. If no exchange contract for the token is listed, the manufacturing contract creates an exchange contract and registers the new ERC-20 token.

Liquidity pool platforms such as Uniswap are increasingly becoming the system of choice for distributing this new class of DeFi tokens, and the volume traded on these DEXs soared in 2020 and 2021.

## The Advantage of Token Token On A DEX Automated Market Maker

Automated market making brokers (or AMMs) don't use trade books like traditional brokers — where buyers are connected with individual sellers. Instead, brokers such as Uniswap use an alternative method to settle trades in cryptocurrencies.

Rather than forming a pair of buyers and sellers, tokens are bought and sold at a rate determined by a bonding curve .

With this mechanism, tokens are acquired if the price goes up, and as tokens are sold, the price goes down. In both cases, the exchange rate is determined by a supply curve rather than a market with offers made by buyers and sellers.

Foreign exchange contracts contain a pool of specific ERC-20 tokens and a counterparty token (such as ETH, USDC etc.). If there is a supply of both tokens, a trade can take place with an automatically generated price based on supply and demand.

The user does not have to worry about connecting with another trader to exchange or specify a price.

Since price and counterparties do not need to be considered and trading takes place automatically, launching a project via an IDO or an AMM from a DEX is an easier process to raise capital than other token offer models such as initial offers for currencies (ICOs) and brokerage initial offers (IEOs) .

## ICOs x IDOs

With the [development of Initial Coin Offerings](https://www.blockchainx.tech/ico-development) (ICOs) model, popularized between 2017 and 2018, projects performed token sales through a website, where custody and token transfers were based on trust, not stand-alone contracts or pre-fabricated infrastructure , such as Uniswap.

This required the development and management of a centralized website just to make the sale.

When the sale was made, another big difference with the ICO model was that, after the launch sale ended, projects still needed to find a broker or a secondary market to trade their tokens.

This was problematic for projects financed via ICO, as most of the most popular crypto brokers charged between tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to integrate a new token.

Listing at several centralized brokerages required gaining access so that a sufficient number of active investors would integrate sufficient liquidity for trading pairs. It was an expensive and time-consuming experience.

With IDOs, a trading market is created at the same time a token is released, as the creation of secondary markets is automatic and allowed in decentralized AMMs.

This results in an active market for trading and liquidity immediately accessible to participants after the initial sale of the token — solving problems such as liquidity and price uncertainty.

ICOs were primarily applied via Ethereum's ERC-20 protocol standard and quickly became the most popular use case on the network. They were an essential factor in the price increase of ether ( ETH ) in 2017.

Investors who wanted to access exclusive business flow opportunities needed to accumulate ether to participate in ICOs.

It also resulted in new users and transaction activity on the Ethereum blockchain, creating a positive feedback loop that boosted the price of the cryptocurrency.

IDOs, as well as ICOs, also played a role in propelling ether's price during the most recent uptrend. Tokens released through IDOs offer aggressive yields similar to ICOs and have users creating Ethereum accounts and transacting on the network.

It's important to mention that there are other factors behind the ether price boost, including the growing DeFi and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) sectors and a growth in interoperability between blockchains , allowing new projects to connect to Ethereum.

But this time, the token offering craze is spreading to other blockchain platforms — most notably Binance Smart Chain (BSC) .

At the first big IDO on Uniswap, UMA , on April 23, the price of ether had risen by 2,227%. Since the first big IDO on PancakeSwap, BLINk , on November 20, the price of the binance coin ( BNB ) has risen by 2.313%.

## The next step for IDOs: token pools and settlement curves with checks

Another evolution of IDO came with the launch of IDO-specific platforms such as Polkastarter , BCS starter and Samurai .

What differentiates token releases on these platforms from token releases on Uniswap and PancakeSwap is the verification process for the listing of tokens on these platforms.

At Polkastarter, for example, the application process is overseen by Polastarter's staff and board, which includes members from Huobi , Polygon , Alchemy and other investors and entrepreneurs.

BSCstarter is a decentralized funding platform for [Binance Smart Chain ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/bep20-token-development)protocols. It sets itself apart from other launch platforms in that it is completely community-governed.

It has few compliance requirements for projects aiming to join this community. Instead, it opts for a system where the BSCstarter community determines which projects are worth listing using its collective audit and its own surveys.

The system leverages the prudence of the contribution concept so that it is the verification of possibly unfavorable projects.

Anyone can sign up on BSCstarter to launch a token on the platform. After submitting the request, a presales contract is generated based on the token design rule.

Community members who have a specific balance of START , the native token of BSCstarter, will have the opportunity to audit submitted projects. They can vote “yes” or “no” and, when a vote is sent, it cannot be changed.

Projects that receive more “yes” votes than “no” votes and receive at least 10% of the total START token supply as a “yes” vote will receive approval to begin their sale."

About three months ago, I fell down a rabbit hole in the form of an academic paper called  [SHORT SELLING, DEATH SPIRAL CONVERTIBLES, AND THE PROFITABILITY OF STOCK MANIPULATION by John D. Finnerty](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf).

[Finnerty](http://www.finnecon.com/), a [finance professor](https://www.fordham.edu/gabelli-school-of-business/faculty/full-time-faculty/john-finnerty/), lays out his theoretical model describing naked short selling and mathematical equations governing it. Over the course of six posts, I examine the paper and his theories then apply them to get an estimate of shares shorted from December 2015 to April 2021.

The current estimate of total shorted shares are as follows (as we get more information about true short interest and I fix bugs in the model, the answer will probably be updated):

Note: SI% based on 77 million total shares outstanding

|Estimate made: 7/4/21|Quantity|SI %|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Low Estimate|1.3 billion|1688 %|

***MAIN TAKEWAYS FROM FIRST SERIES***

[Math Black Magic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw8281/math_black_magic_vol_1_why_it_is_mathematically/) centers around the breakdown of the market mechanics behind naked short selling as described in the Finnerty Paper. Main takeaways:

1. In order to short a stock to zero, you must short at least the same amount of shares the firm has outstanding doubling the float in the process.
2. FOMO is our strength. I speculate that apes' willingness to buy at higher and higher prices is what tripped up the algo and led to the run up. This is likely where SHF painted themselves into the corner.
3. I make an initial rough estimate that hedgies had shorted at least of 800 million shares and as high as a trillion.  In later, posts I refine my model and revise the answer to the current one.
4. There is a distinct price pattern left by naked short selling. First, price drops by a third. Second, that price is cut in in half. Third, the price is kicked down close to zero.

***MAIN TAKEAWAYS FROM SECOND SERIES***

In Short &amp; Shorter I lay out how I came to the revised estimate and make my conjecture on the strategy Kenny &amp; Co. had been applying. This series refers heavily to topics discussed in the previous series and dives pretty deep into microeconomics. Main theories I put forward:

1. Kenny, Steve, Gabe and Jeff have been maximizing profit by naked short selling strong companies with inelastic demand curves.
2. They may have rolled over FTDs, but they haven't net covered one share.
3. They have a monopoly on GME shares. Monopolies have no supply curves and their output is only determined by the market demand curve and their marginal cost curve.
4. I theorize that when the amount of shares outstanding are doubled through naked shorting, the price is cut in half. However, in order to double the amount of shares outstanding in the next attack, the manipulator will have to short double the amount of shares they shorted in the first attack. (Dilution works both ways)

How I plan to FIRE using free education and living in a tax haven,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/p9aub9/how_i_plan_to_fire_using_free_education_and/,Fire_Lord_OP,1,2021-08-22 19:28:49,22,/r/Fire/comments/p9aub9/how_i_plan_to_fire_using_free_education_and/,NaN,"30 yo, 48k USD in stocks. 10k USD in student debt with 1% interest.

I got a free education from Denmark and I got paid while taking it, while I mostly lived cheaply at my ex gf’s and my dads place (as he was travelling 5 months a year). When I graduated I applied for PhDs in finance and got admitted to MPhil finance in Hong Kong after a year. I get a student stipend here of about 3k USD and I’m able to save roughly 1250 USD a month. Planning to graduate next year.

I am quite old because:

1 year exchange in USA cost 7k USD.
1 year in Greenlandic high school (different system than Danish, so it slowed me down a year)
1 year in Beijing learning Chinese (break even from small jobs there)
1 year part time work saving 7k USD and feeling ill with unknown disease that eventually disappeared
1 year applying for PhDs

So, my plan is to try to find a jobs in HK at age 31 and grind it out for the next 5-13 years. If I can put away 3k USD per month for 13 years, I’m very likely to be top 1% richest in Denmark by age 44. That seems like enough money to where anything beyond that is just pointless. 

At the same time I’m trying to buy a property in Denmark and rent it out. Any spare cash will be deployed in the stock market immediately.

I’m staying in Hong Kong because the income tax is very low and salaries are high for finance jobs. Expecting to make 5k USD a month. Rent is very high in the city, but I don’t care about living far from the center, my long term FIRE goal is more important. There is no tax on stocks at all, which I love, already saved me 4K USD this year.

Things that could derail this plan includes, meeting a girl and getting children, which frankly would be a good thing.

Not landing a job that pays 5k USD.

Other curve balls life through at you.

The company has had a hard time filling the role, and finding qualified candidates apparently (which in and of itself surprised me). My friend talked about my background and thought I could be a good fit, they shared that interest and asked for my resume and quickly set up an interview.

 This company has over 50 locations or units across the country, and this controller position is the controller for one of those units. Each unit also has a VP of finance so I’m not the one in charge of the unit, however I would have direct reports.

My concern is will I be able to effectively manage the team? I would be coming in with no industry specific experience and no corporate accounting experience, on top of no management experience. They know this as well, it’s not like I’m lying about it. I meet all the posting’s required qualifications. They generated the interest in me. I am up for the challenge and the learning curve. 

Am I overthinking and psyching myself out with general self-doubt that occurs with any big career change? Has anyone made a similar leap to this? Maybe it’s normal?

To clarify - no offer yet. I’m just trying to prep for the interview and possibility of the job being offered. It may not even happen, but their interest is very strong. 

Any advice and insight appreciated!"
Yield Farming and Gas fees,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p9flip/yield_farming_and_gas_fees/,surgerix,1,2021-08-23 00:28:45,12,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p9flip/yield_farming_and_gas_fees/,STRATEGY,"I have been farming in 3 platforms since April. The gains have been good so far except for some losses during the Iron Finance catastrophe which has been paid off since. 

Aave and Curve are great but I am planning to close my farms on Polygon network and possibly move assets to Avalanche. 

My dilemma is that the gas fees moving from Matic network to Mainnet are intimidating to say the least. 

1. Any farmers here who can advise on the best or cheapest way to move assets to Mainnet?

2. How much assets would be worth it paying the gas fees?

3. Would you degen farm on Avalanche or stay on Polygon?


I don't have binance or Kucoin. 

I use metamask.

And yes, I have crypto in Celsius and blockfi as well but gains in defi are way better (at least back in April) than the interest in Cel and blockfi.

Thank you for sincere/serious recs/advice."
Where do you earn interest on your stablecoins?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p9u62x/where_do_you_earn_interest_on_your_stablecoins/,brian2707,1,2021-08-23 14:37:48,45,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p9u62x/where_do_you_earn_interest_on_your_stablecoins/,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION," 

I have a large part of my savings in crypto. But, I'm not a total ape and do hold a lot of stablecoins. However, holding stablecoins in your wallet is a huge waste of capital because you can easily earn 5-40% interest on them. Where do you guys deposit your stablecoins, what yield are you getting, and what’s the reason for you using that platform over others?

On deciding where to deposit, I think most look for security. Reassuring places might be large CeDeFi entities like Celsius, BlockFi, or Coinbase, where you can earn 8.9%, 7.5%, and 4% interest, respectively. Next might be old-name DeFi platforms, like Aave (2%), Compound (4%), Yearn (8%), or Curve (8% in CRV rewards). But, Ethereum has high fees and Yearn has been exploited before.

Of all the protocols I’ve researched, I think Alpaca Finance on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) offers really high yields (20-50%), while still being secure and trusted. Even though BSC has a bad rep, Alpaca Finance is different. They are a blue-chip protocol and leader in leveraged yield farming across all DeFi chains They have $1.6B in TVL, 11 audits on their smart contracts, and developed many of their own security measures, such as time-locked contracts and an Oracle Guard. If you visit their [Docs](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/), you can see the sheer amount of information and transparency they provide. It’s much more than other protocols. From their well-designed user interface and NFT campaigns, you can see how serious they are about their product.

How does Alpaca give you such high interest rates? Leveraged yield farming of stablecoins. For example, if you open a USDT-BUSD leveraged yield farm and deposit $10k USDT, you can borrow up to $50k BUSD (6x leverage) and farm the combined total of $60k. It’s a little bit like Aave, where users deposit stablecoins, borrow stablecoins, and repeat, so they are essentially leveraged up on stablecoins while capturing all that yield. But, the difference is Alpaca Finance 1) does this in one easy step for you and 2) routes your stablecoins to providing liquidity on AMMs, which is more profitable than borrowing/lending (Aave, Compound). Thus, you can get 20-50% yields (right now it’s at 40%).

Anyway, let me know what you guys think. Feel free to ask me anything about leveraged farming or DeFi in general. I just want to spread the word that you can still profit by just holding stablecoins, no need to ape everything into crypto."

# 

# Here are all the ways I’ve lost money in crypto:

* **Lost a private key (2015-2016)**

Bitcoin was a nightmare back in the day. There were no credit card onramps and no easy wallets. Basically your only option was downloading a client, and using some kind of P2P escrow service, which involved sending money to a random bank account and then waiting up to 24 hours while you hoped some BTC would appear. I downloaded [multibit](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MultiBit) somewhere around this time and promptly lost the keys. I think it had something like 0.1 btc in it, so not the end of the world, but still. I formatted that computer last year and sighed to myself when I noticed that app still lurking there. Coinbase ramped up in this period and the space improved a bit.

I was never one of these “farmed 1000s btc and lost it all” guys, more like bought and spent 1-2 to see what it was all about. I could kick myself for not buying more while I had the chance, but I’m honestly just glad I explored a little. I’d much rather have gone through all the hassle of buying a tiny bit of btc and losing it, than not trying at all.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Didn’t buy Ethereum (2016)**

After my initial foray in 2015, I forgot all about crypto for 2 years and didn't get involved again until Spring 2017. However, I was still receiving emails from Coinbase during that time, including the one above. Wish I’d paid attention to that one.

&amp;#x200B;

[Eth was trading at around $12 when I got this email.](https://preview.redd.it/w0099kd0t2j71.png?width=2430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41c4c1e4f95e86c34f6d634e2726d6ef8de00a7c)

&amp;#x200B;

* **September 2017 China FUD**

I got back into crypto in 2017 and started DCA’ing regularly. I saw my portfolio go up dramatically and got protective. There was a great fear it would all end. Because China. I sent btc over to an exchange, sold to fiat, waited for a dip and bought back in when things looked up. But after days of sweating buckets, hours of watching charts, 100s of dollars in fees, I ended up with actually slightly less crypto at the end of it. Lesson learned: HODL’ing really is easier and more effective than trying to time the market. Additional lesson learned: There will always be China FUD. This too shall pass.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Bitgrail hack (2017)**

Reddit got excited about this new token called raiblocks that was fast and free. Only problem - the main place you could buy it was a shitty Italian exchange called BitGrail. It got hacked. I lost some raiblocks and some litecoin I had there. For those who don’t know, raiblocks became Nano. You might have heard of it. It still gets mentioned here occasionally.

&amp;#x200B;

* **COSS exchange (2018)**

Ooh boy, this was a disaster. COSS had a unique fee allocation model that would reward holders of their token. The more people who used the exchange, the more you would benefit by accumulating a split of the fees. Except it was appallingly badly managed, every launch was a fuckup, and it started to resemble a Ponzi. KuCoin then did their idea much better. COSS eventually locked everyone out of their account while they did an audit, and amazingly some users are still locked out. I managed to get most of my tokens off their platform before this and logged back in to the new version during 2020 to scrape out the last dregs left there. I’d actually love to see a full investigation of what happened. [One redditor visited Singapore in 2018 to interview the team](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7w07mi/my_expectations_for_coss_after_one_week_with_the/). There’s got to be some interesting stories to tell. It looks like they abandoned the project and new management came in.

&amp;#x200B;

* **QTUM swap (2018)**

I have one whole erc-20 QTUM token in an old wallet, that will forever sit there. I missed the token swap and only found out this year. [Could have been worse](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/n05biy/i_have_100k_worth_of_old_qtum_am_i_fucked/).

&amp;#x200B;

* **Belt Venus pools (2021)**

[https://medium.com/belt-finance/belt-finance-april-21-incident-report-venus-issue-2fe82f6e0c69](https://medium.com/belt-finance/belt-finance-april-21-incident-report-venus-issue-2fe82f6e0c69)

Belt leveraged borrowing/depositing on Venus protocol. When Venus changed their withdrawal fee, several complications led to Belt’s pools slowly losing value. I was **very** lucky here and happened to be awake in the middle of the night when the news broke over telegram. I managed to withdraw my funds with a loss of maybe $100. Many people slept through the ordeal and awoke the next day to find out they were down thousands, and couldn’t even withdraw, being forced to watch their stakes lose even more value.

&amp;#x200B;

* **PancakeBunny hack (2021)**

[Urgh, this sucked](https://cointelegraph.com/news/pancakebunny-tanks-96-following-200m-flash-loan-exploit). I had money in wbnb-bunny. Bunny lost 90% of its value. Probably my biggest loss in crypto. TBF, Bunny made a compensation pool, and are still coming up with new ways to provide compensation. I broke the LP and sold everything at a massive loss, because the opportunity cost was too great. But who knows, the team and their token may make a comeback.

&amp;#x200B;

* **τBitcoin (2021)**

[tauBitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/t-bitcoin/) was meant to be pegged 1:1 with regular bitcoin. You could LP it with BTCB on pancakeswap for nice apy, and I’m always looking to increase my bitcoin stash. I added some but then it started to come off its peg. Turns out you were also taxed 30% for selling (to discourage further loss of peg). There were giant red flags all over this project and its related project BTCST. Deciding to break the LP, suffer huge impermanent loss, **and** be taxed 30% on it, was a tough decision to make. But the fear of riding it to zero was even worse, so I got out. It has one of the strangest telegram channels I’ve ever witnessed and remains the only telegram channel I’ve been banned from. It’s just bots talking to each other, and “volunteers” saying “soon” or banning users whenever they ask anything about the failed rebase. Seriously, fuck these guys.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why it doesn’t really matter

The main factor is simply time. If you are patient, then you will do well in this space. Bitcoin and Ethereum trend upwards over time. It is always tempting to seek higher returns through other opportunities, just don’t lose sight of the main two. Going all in on a shill of the month won’t always work. 

Crypto is endlessly fascinating and constantly changing. I think it’s worth experimenting with protocols and trying stuff out. If there are some losses along the way, that’s par for the course. DeFi is changing everything and I’m glad I tackled the steep learning curve to get on it early. I suffered some losses, but I made far more on the wins. If I never tried to explore new things, I’d have never even set up my first bitcoin wallet. That said, I’d actually describe myself as a fairly conservative hodler. I keep the majority of my portfolio in eth and btc and I allocate fairly small percentages to altcoins or degenerate yield farming. I was able to stomach a few hacks because it was never more than 5% of my portfolio. I also didn’t constantly run between flavours of the month. There’s nothing wrong with taking a stab at a new token, or a new farm, but maybe don’t do five at once and switch every week. It’s too much effort for too little reward.

Keep some of your crypto in btc and eth, earn interest where you can, and give it five years. You’re gonna make it. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

"BUSTA, the Next Generation in GameFi Arrives on Binance Smart Chain.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMars/comments/p9ywcn/busta_the_next_generation_in_gamefi_arrives_on/,toaster011011,1,2021-08-23 20:34:03,12,/r/CryptoMars/comments/p9ywcn/busta_the_next_generation_in_gamefi_arrives_on/,NaN,"**It’s time to go $BUST or go home.**

BUSTA is the next IDO on the [Starter.xyz](http://starter.xyz/) multichain launchpad, and we are excited about this next-generation iGaming &amp; DeFi platform.

Taking place on Starter BSC, BUSTA combines two of the most sought after utilities of 2021, decentralized finance, and iGaming, culminating in a term we have all become rather familiar with — GameFi.

At the heart of BUSTA is the multi-token crash game. But there is so much more to BUSTA than this devilishly addictive crash game, in fact, there is a whole ecosystem, DEX included! — Designed from the ground up to reward the $BUST DAO and therefore $BUST holders.

# What is BUSTA?

BUSTA aims to boldly go where no crash game has gone before… Binance Smart Chain. In fact, there are many more unique factors to BUSTA than simply this.

## The five main components of the BUSTA ecosystem include:

1. **iGaming platform:** $STARTing with BUSTA CRASH, a progressive jackpot game, this will eventually be the home of many games.
2. **Trading and betting module:** BUSTA contains its own niche DEX and farm for profitability for trading and betting on $BUST, as well as partner tokens.
3. **Partnership programme:** The program has a new approach to increasing the user base through referral links, where both parties benefit from a steady flow of passive income from play, trade and farming.
4. **Partnership portal:** Partners can list tokens in the BUSTA platform for constant pressure when burning the partner’s native token, which is provided by automated revenue collection and distribution.
5. **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO):** BUSTA’s DAO allows the community to control most of the ecosystem in the voting process.

## A Genuinely Rewarding Ecosystem

The founders of BUSTA aim to create a circular business model that would benefit players, investors, participants, traders, affiliates and partners. The ecosystem is designed so that each component benefits the other; and as each grows in popularity and volume, the entire ecosystem and community reap rewards.

*If you are really keen on understanding how the* BUSTA *Ecosystem works, then check this bad boy out!*

**Be the House**

\#GameFi is at the heart of the BUSTA ecosystem, and alongside the unique DEX concept, offers a huge amount of utility for the entire platform.

The iGaming platform will essentially grant the players the ability to be the ‘house’ by betting and holding $BUST and winning prizes while people play and trade.

The first game to launch on the platform, based on the hugely popular BustaBit, is BUSTA CRASH — and what’s more, it’s in BETA and waiting for you to play right now with BNB.

Well, what are you waiting for!? Get a taste for what BUSTA build: [http://crash.busta.gg](http://crash.busta.gg/)

***How does BUSTA CRASH work?***  
Users can place their bets with BNB (or partner tokens in the future), watch the multiplier curve increase exponentially, and then click the stop button to claim their winnings before the game eventually collapses. That way, the longer the round, the more you can win … but if the game crashes before you go out, the bet is lost.

## iGaming &amp; Crypto

Crypto and gaming have long had their fates aligned. United by a common audience, the two separate markets are fast finding their synergy.

The BUSTA GameFi platform aims to capitalise on this, with new, original games already in the works, and acquisitions of gaming companies, and third party gaming integrations firmly in their sights.

Each of the games will be demonstrably fair and will generate a small amount of revenue for the ecosystem in the form of the edge of the house. The edge of the house will then be distributed throughout the ecosystem through smart contracts for the benefit of the community and $ BUST token holders.

## A DEX Like No Other

The crypto space is full of punchy one-liners and marketing spin, but when BUSTA says it has created a decentralized exchange like no other, it is no exaggeration.

The BUSTA DEX, initially launching on BSC with cross-chain firmly on the agenda, allows for customizable transaction taxes and automated fee distribution to benefit listed tokens in ways never before seen in DeFi.

In short, what this means, is that any token (take LINK for example) can add liquidity to the BUSTA DEX and fully customise the transaction tax for their token.

The current model: Uniswap, like many other DEX’s, operates with a transaction (or trading) tax. This tax collects a small percentage of every trade that takes place on the exchange (usually around 0.25–0.5%) and then shares it between the DEX treasury and rewards for liquidity providers. This is how the DEX earns fees, and how LP providers are rewarded.

Currently, there is no way of altering this tax. It is applicable to every token, and every trade that takes place on the DEX.

The BUSTA DEX, for the first time, has built the transaction tax functionality into the router of their automated market maker (AMM) — and as a result, has made it fully customisable.

This tailored transaction tax is very attractive for a number of reasons. Primarily, for tokens plagued by trading bots, BUSTA DEX provides a safe haven. But also, for tokens that value their availability on Centralised Exchanges (CEXs), BUSTA DEX provides a way for them to have both.

Many CEXs just outright don’t list tokens with transaction taxes — especially most of the big ones because the exchanges have to consider the tx tax every time they process a withdrawal or transfer funds between wallets internally. Conversely, many of these tokens are missing out on a small tax that could be used to reinvest into their ecosystem. BUSTA is the solution.

*A single liquidity pool usually integrates two tokens and each pool creates a market for that specific pair of token (e.g. MEX/EGLD, MEX/BUSD).*

*It is used to permit decentralized trading, borrowing or lending and it usually represents the backbone of a decentralized exchange (DEX). A liquidity pool is the most important component of any DeFi platform and it substitutes the traditional order book model, used by a centralized exchange.*

*A liquidity pool can also represent the intersection of orders which decides whether an asset will move uptrend or downtrend. The liquidity pool is a very important aspect of* [***automated market makers (AMM)***](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm)*, yield farming, borrow-lend protocols, on-chain insurance, synthetic assets, blockchain-based games etc.*

# What are the existing types of liquidity pools?

*There are two types of platforms using liquidity pools:*

&amp;#x200B;

1. *Lending platforms* *– a single asset liquidity pool. The lender will deposit a type of token and will get cTokens, which are derivatives that derive their value from the assets deposited by the lender. A borrower deposits collateral to get a cToken and obtain a loan. In both cases, the transactions are between the lender and a smart contract on one hand and between the borrower and a smart contract on the other hand. Best known such platforms are Compound, AAVE and Maker*
2. *Decentralized exchanges (DEX)* *– dual asset liquidity pool. The most popular DEXs are Uniswap, Bancor, Sushiswap and Curve Finance.*

&amp;#x200B;

# What is a liquidity provider (LP)?

&amp;#x200B;

*Liquidity providers* *(LPs) contribute with an equal value of two tokens and this way create a market. In exchange for this, they gain trading fees corresponding to the trades that take place in the pool, proportional with their contribution in the total liquidity.*

*The interaction is this case is between a trader and the liquidity pool, without any other counterparty. If you want to buy an asset, you don’t need a seller of that asset, only enough liquidity in the pool.*

*When a LP provides liquidity to a pool, they get LP tokens, proportional to the liquidity they provided in that pool. When a trade facilitated by the pool happens, the corresponding fee is proportionally distributed to all the LP tokens holders. When a LP decides to withdraw their liquidity, plus the yielded fees, they must burn their LP tokens.*

# What’s the mechanism of a liquidity pool?

&amp;#x200B;

*Specific for a liquidity pool is the constant product equation:*

***x \* y = k***

*If a pool consists of units in token x and units in token y, any trades would take place in the pool, the quantities in x and y obtained after the trade, if multiplied, remain unchanged and it’s equal to the constant k.*

 

[Liquidity Pool](https://preview.redd.it/vj0ej5erf4j71.png?width=294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c688b0b119cc0ed64b32cf574d492d7aadf9bff)

*The price of the assets in the pool* *is established by the ratio between them in the pool. The ratio of the assets changes, but liquidity in the pool remains constant.*

*A liquidity pool use a constant product market maker algorithm. This makes it possible that the product of the amounts of the two given tokens always remains constant. Thanks to the algorithm, a pool can provide liquidity, no matter how big a trade is. That’s because the algorithm* *asymptotically increases the price of the most desired token. If a person buys MEX from a MEX/EGLD pool, they reduce the supply of MEX and adds the supply of EGLD, which will lead to an increase in the price of MEX and a decrease in the price of EGLD. Bigger pools mean a smaller move in the price of the contained tokens.*

# How about the incentives in a liquidity pool?

&amp;#x200B;

*Rewards* *can be different, depending on the platform: on a DEX, they could be a share in the trading fee, but on a lending platform they could represent a share of the interest received from the borrowers.*

*Yield farming or liquidity mining* *refers to the fact that liquidity pools are used to generate yield. The yielded tokens are first* *distributed algorithmically to the liquidity providers who contributed to the pool. In the second stage, the newly minted tokens are distributed proportionally to the users.*

*Some decentralized exchanges started to incentivize LPs with extra tokens for providing liquidity to specific pools, a process which is called “liquidity mining”. Extra tokens serve as a stimulus in creating larger liquidity pools and thus less slippage and a higher quality trading experience.*

*Minting of synthetic assets* *is another achievement one can benefit from liquidity pools. Users need to add collateral to a pool and get information about pricing from oracle services. They get a synthetic token, which can be pegged to precious metals, stocks etc.*

# What is impermanent loss in a liquidity pool?

*Impermanent loss* *takes place when the price of the tokens provided in the liquidity pool changes, compared with the moment they were deposited in that pool. The greater the change is, the greater the impermanent loss. The loss means less value at withdrawal time than at deposit time. Impermanent loss can be minimized by the trading fees in many situations.*

***e.g.*** *A liquidity provider deposits 1 eGLD and 100 BUSD in a liquidity pool. The deposited pair must be of equivalent value, which means that the price of 1 eGLD is 100 BUSD at the moment of depositing. The dollar value of the deposit is 200 USD when creating the deposit and let’s assume that there is a total of 100 eGLD and 10,000 BUSD in the pool, so the share of the LP in the pool will be 1%. The constant k is 100 \* 10,000 = 1,000,000.*

Further, let’s imagine a scenario where users swap BUSD for eGLD, thus adding BUSD and removing eGLD from the pool, until the pool reaches 80 eGLD and 12,500 BUSD. In this case, *1 eGLD is now equivalent to 156.25 BUSD, the ratio between both tokens will be changed, but the constant k is the same (80 \* 12,500 = 1,000,000).*

*At this moment, when the LP decides to withdraw their funds, the LP will get 1% from the pool (0.8 eGLD and 125 BUSD) and the deposit values 250 USD. The profit is obvious, but a loss took place: if they holded 1 eGLD and 100 BUSD, the total value could have been 256.25 USD. The impermanent loss is 256.25 USD – 250 USD = 6.25 USD. There are circumstances when impermanent loss can bring big losses and it’s recommended to take this concept into account when providing tokens in a liquidity pool.*

*If the trading fees for the EGLD/BUSD pool are 0.3%, the LP from this example is entitled to 1% of 0.3% of the total value of all successful trades. This way, the impermanent loss is minimized by the trading fees a LP gains by participating to a liquidity pool.*

# What are the advantages and disadvantages of liquidity pools?

&amp;#x200B;

***Main advantages***

* *Anyone can become a liquidity provider if they hold the appropriate asset(s)*
* *There are no intermediary entities, users can trade directly from their wallets*
* *Earning transaction fees can be very profitable*
* *The opportunity to gain yield farming reward tokens*
* *A liquidity pool doesn’t need a buyer and a seller of a certain asset, but the leverage of* *a pre-funded liquidity pool.*
* *In a liquidity pool, trades take place with limited slippage for the pairs involved, as long as there is a large liquidity pool.*
* *The implementation of insurance protocols is an advantage, because it provides protection if funds are stolen or lost*

&amp;#x200B;

***Main disadvantages/Risks***

* *Smart contract bugs*
* *Admin keys*
* *Impermanent loss*
* *Hacks*
* *Systemic risks*
* *Slippage due to high orders*
* *The pricing algorithm may fail*

# How can anyone join a liquidity pool?

&amp;#x200B;

*The method to join to a liquidity pool* *differs, according to the chosen platform. You usually must create an account on the platform, connect your wallet and deposit the tokens into the liquidity pool.*

Done with the GMAT forever,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/pa9d1x/done_with_the_gmat_forever/,themilkgoblin,1,2021-08-24 05:33:03,9,/r/GMAT/comments/pa9d1x/done_with_the_gmat_forever/,Testing Experience :snoo::snoo_sad::snoo_biblethump:,"Hey y'all,

Thought I'd share my experience with the GMAT in case it can be of use to anyone. Diagnostic 630 ---&gt; 740 on official exam in three months.

I started studying back in May by taking a class my university offers (although I graduated in 2018). My initial diagnostic through Kaplan was ovr 630 q37 v39, which was fairly encouraging given I'd only put in one week. Quant is def my weak area, especially compared to the super genius engineers that seem to take this test-- shout out to you all for ruining the curve for dumbos like me :) For context, I'm a white US citizen, Finance undergrad, career in program management in fintech banking.

The class was marginally helpful, but the geometry I learned definitely stuck. I think I got a lot more but going my own route.

My second practice test was again Kaplan a few weeks later, where I scored ovr 640 q38 v40. I was pretty devastated by the minimal improvement, although cut myself some slack considering I slept very poorly the night before. 

I tried to study 1-2 hours daily, 6 days per week. I usually started by reviewing problems I had missed in practice tests or question banks, then moving on to new problems. I also found youtube videos EXTREMELY helpful. Magoosh and Manhattan have a ton of free videos there, meant to entice you to purchase their programs, but when you consider that there are 10+ test prep companies also doing this, most topics you could want are covered. I would often leverage these videos as I commuted to and from work (many can be consumed without actually seeing the screen). I also practiced using the OG question banks.

My next practice test a GMAT Official Practice test #2. I scored ovr 700 q42 v44. I was ecstatic because &gt;700 was always the goal, and I still had about a month left to study. I'm not sure why I did so much better on the Official practice test. I've heard the math in Kap is more difficult, but I can't say for certain I noticed that. 

Over the course of my last month, I stuck to the same routine of reviewing problems I had missed and then working on new ones, watching youtube to learn new concepts and also leveraging GMAT Club heavily for problems I couldn't figure out (Official Practice Tests don't have solutions). 

I took Official tests 4 and 6 and scored ovr 710 q45 v42 and ovr 710 q44 v42. I should mention an issue that I ran into during both of these practice tests. As I began the quant sections, I came upon 
 a question both times very early that I knew how to do but just couldn't figure out. I could tell this would be considered an easy question, so this absolutely wrecked my psyche. In one of those practice tests, when I hit this point I straight up stopped the exam. I thought that there was no use in continuing since I had used 5 mins on one easy question that I likely missed. I decided to keep going though, and was glad I did. 

That last test was about a week before my actual test, so I assumed I had topped out at 710 (which to me was great!). I was hoping to hit 700-720 on the actual exam, but was nervous after hearing stories of people getting scores way lower than their practice tests. 

The day before the exam, I did no studying at all. I had a pit in my stomach for the entire week of the exam too. I never became super nervous for tests in college, but this one got to me.

The day came and I made sure to eat a light lunch and watch funny videos before my test. I arrived and the center feeling nervous, but confident that I had done all I could do to prepare. When I began the test, my heart dropped as one of the first quant questions was an easy work rate problem, and for some reason my brain could never wrap my head around those. Definitely my weakest of the common quant types. I started to panic, much as I did in previous practice tests when I knew I missed an easy question. But, I pushed on anyway with laser focus. I knew it was make or break time I guess and I had promised myself I would finish the exam no matter what just to get any kind of score. 

I thought that I had done a poor job in quant. Verbal felt really good. I was so focused and managed my time very well. If you asked me how I performed overall, I would have guessed 680-700. When I hit submit and saw my 740, I felt like crying. I thought it was a mistake. I was PUMPED. IR was 8, too.

Looking back, I still don't know why I did so much better than I had on the latest practice tests, but I do know that I set myself up for maximum success by doing literally every tip I saw online (dressing up, plenty of sleep, no studying on test day, words of affirmation, and, of course, lots of previous study to give me confidence). 

Overall, I'm just way stoked to have this behind me. It was a long journey but has given me not only a weapon in my holster when applying to B schools, but also self confidence that I can take beyond. 

I'm happy to answer any questions, and good luck to each of you in jour GMAT journey."
MUST-READ! E.E's latest posts help us understand Synthetic Shares!,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMCSTOCKS/comments/pac8v8/mustread_ees_latest_posts_help_us_understand/,AwesomeVisionaries,1,2021-08-24 08:14:23,20,/r/AMCSTOCKS/comments/pac8v8/mustread_ees_latest_posts_help_us_understand/,DD,"I have been closely following the genius E.E on Yahoo Finance and believe his posts are the most informative &amp; comprehensive ones to me. The below shows how he deduces the amount of AMC synthetic shares with step-by-step calculations. I do hope this could spread to help Apes  &amp; many others.

&amp;#x200B;

*This research was performed by E.E on Aug 22, 2021*

""Background: Dark pools emerged in the 1980s when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allowed brokers to transact large blocks of shares. Electronic trading and an SEC ruling in 2007 that was designed to increase competition and cut transaction costs have stimulated an increase in the number of dark pools.

Dark pools are private exchanges for trading securities that are not accessible by the investing public. ... Dark pools came about primarily to facilitate block trading by institutional investors who did not wish to impact the markets with their large orders and obtain adverse prices for their trades.

Dark pools are off-market prices that may be far from the public market with little transparency.  The prices at which trades are executed in dark pools may diverge from prices displayed in the public markets, which puts retail investors at a huge disadvantage.

We know they (SHFs) have been shorting AMC stock in January.  We know that the SHFs had massive FTD on January 8, 2021, with about 11.5 Million shares @ Avg. $2.05 Price for the FTD amount of $23.6 Million Dollars.  I will use this date as the first day that SHFs massively traded in the dark pool. 

I will perform the Average Volume traded in the dark pools since Jan 8, 2021, to see if the same synthetic shares that I previously calculated for AMC exist.

**1). Average Volume of AMC stock: 170,926,174 shares;**  

**2). Avg. dark pool volume: about 60%;**  

**3). # of days since dark pool trading: 160 trading days (from Jan 8 - Aug 20, 2021):**

170,926,174 x 60% x 160 = 16.4 Billion shares traded in the dark pools. (+/- 3% margin).

What are 16.4 billion synthetic shares that were created so far?  That is almost 32 times the 513M FLOAT:

What is AMC price for 16.4 billion synthetic shares when MOASS?  (SEE my previous posts for 3B, 18B, 26B synthetic share calculations).

I did my previous calculations to estimate the numbers of shares that were traded in the dark pools (SEE my previous Post).  Based on the May 2021 FINRA report and the Fintel May/June 2021 reports, the numbers of shares traded in the dark pools were estimated at about 18 billion shares (+/- 3% margin)

I believe Wes Christian estimated between 9B - 26B synthetic shares out there.  

With all the DTCC new rule filings taking effect starting Aug. 24, the Apes called for $100k, $250k, $500k FLOOR.  SEE my previous posts to see my breakdown calculations if the $100k, $250k, $500k is possible!   The young Apes need to Know what happens during the MOASS, as I mentioned in my previous post.   There will be many halts, followed by the dips, then the rips.   I believe this will be the biggest MOASS in history.   These are only my research and opinions.  Do your own research before investing.""    

&amp;#x200B;

*This research was performed by E.E on July 17, 2021*

""This particular calculation was based on a ""linear"" straight line of the 30Mil Shares returned on June 2nd. The actual ""curve"" calculation would be much higher, (about 2X - 5X)    

There are about 100M (legal) shares on loan.   I did some calculations to come up with the realistic AMC SP when all the (legal) shares are returned. 

For a ""linear"" straight line based on 30 Mil shares returned on June 2nd:

**1). AMC share price jumped from $35 to $72.**   

**2). If 60M (legal) shares on loan are returned, AMC SP should be about $109.**

**3). If 90M (legal) shares on loan are returned, AMC SP should be about $146.**

**4). If all 100M (legal) shares on loan are returned, AMC SP should be about $158.30.**

I estimated there are about 3B synthetic shares (my estimate is low).  Wes Christian thinks 9B to 26B synthetic shares.  There may be more...

I will provide my calculations for AMC SP for 3B, 9B, and 26B synthetic shares.  

**5). If 3B synthetic shares are returned, AMC Share Price should be about $7,200.**

**6). If 9B synthetic shares are covered, AMC SP should be about $21,600.**

**7). If 26B synthetic shares are covered, AMC SP should be about $62,208 per share.**

&amp;#x200B;

For the ""curve"" calculation, giving the same number of synthetic shares, When MOASS happens, I estimated AMC share price to be about: 

**8). For 3B synthetic shares==&gt;AMC share price should be about $14,400 - $36,000**

**9). For 9B synthetic shares==&gt;AMC SP should be about $43,200 to $108,000**

**10). For 26B synthetic shares==&gt;AMC SP should be about $124,416 to $311,040 per share.**

&amp;#x200B;

I have performed at least 4 different calculations so far to determine the realistic AMC SP during the height of the squeeze.  My most conservative (minimum) AMC share price is $10,000 per share when MOASS happens.  $10k is my most conservatives estimate.  (SEE my previous posts) for all (4) of my PT estimates."""

Sample Letter To Your Local Government Representative,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pah6aj/sample_letter_to_your_local_government/,Always_Question,1,2021-08-24 13:37:19,24,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pah6aj/sample_letter_to_your_local_government/,POLITICS,"We have all witnessed the recent attacks by the U.S. Treasury against the crypto space.  Here is a sample letter that you could send to your local government representative.  I'm in the U.S., so the sample letter is highly-U.S. centric, but please feel welcome to adapt it and use it in whatever jurisdiction you are in around the world.  Of course, governments cannot stop this revolution, but they could surely slow it down.  If we can continue applying constant pressure to elected representatives in a collective effort, I am confident that we can have a positive impact.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Representative \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,

Over the past month or so I have evolved into a single-issue voter. Are you for protecting and fostering the innovative crypto asset space or are you against it? If you are for innovation in this space, and can confirm that with me in a personalized letter, I will get behind you. I will support you with both words and action to their allowable limits.  I will become one of your strongest advocates in our district.

Here is what is happening.  Secretary Janet Yellen and other Treasury bureaucrats have personally lobbied members of Congress for the inclusion of highly vague and restrictive language, which was surreptitiously slid into the infrastructure bill at the last moment, and recently passed by the Senate.   
 Their target is what is known in the crypto space as “decentralized finance” or DeFi, which is a vast new ecosystem of futuristic financial tools built on public decentralized blockchain infrastructure.  DeFi provides financial access and inclusion to the traditionally excluded masses, and offers opportunities for all people throughout the world to access lending markets, yield, and hard crypto assets.  DeFi is uplifting the lives of millions of people around the world, and within the next few years, possibly billions of people.  DeFi is spreading influence of the $dollar even further throughout the world on crypto rails, and is providing a bulwark against China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) advances. Janet Yellen’s approach to regulation would decimate DeFi in America, and drive jobs and wealth overseas.  This misguided effort must be stopped, or else America’s financial stake in the future will be damaged beyond measure.  The legislative branch has the responsibility of drafting legislation with consent of the governed—not nameless unelected bureaucrats within the Treasury Department. 

What is needed is to either 1) entirely remove the crypto-related language from the infrastructure bill, or 2) exclude **non-custodial** participants in the crypto space from the requirement of submitting 1099s, which would be impossible to comply with.  **Non-custodial** participants in DeFi are usually individuals, and simply do not have customers, nor do they even have access to the information required to complete a 1099.  You should understand that even the compromise amendment (that didn't get adopted by the Senate) **did not** have an exclusion for **non-custodial** participants, and therefore, **did not** go far enough.  It defies logic to pass this kind of law unless the sole goal is to drive innovation and wealth out of America.  Many people now make a living wage or better from participating in DeFi, and many of these people would sooner leave American altogether and take their wealth and jobs with them if Janet Yellen and Treasury were to get their way.

So, I urge you to come up the learning curve on crypto and DeFi, and to get behind the fastest growing technology and most innovative space in America. The smartest people in the room are the ones involved with this technology, and it is rapidly seeping into the lives of ordinary Americans. Our state is a hot bed for this technology and start-up businesses that have latched onto it.  Don’t yield to the temptation of regulating this space out of existence.  If that happens, it will still exist; it’s just that America and Americans would lose out.  Again, if you reply to me with a personalized letter including a commitment to protect this innovative space, you will have my vote and undying support."

Exhaustive list of companies and individuals that hate crypto,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/paljti/exhaustive_list_of_companies_and_individuals_that/,giddyup281,1,2021-08-24 19:36:53,75,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/paljti/exhaustive_list_of_companies_and_individuals_that/,POLITICS," Thought I'd give my two satoshis on the vast number of companies and individuals that have changed their views on Bitcoin and crypto over the years. Or if they have not changed it, why that is. 

The biggest “excuses” for their harsh stance on crypto are always illegal activities and illegal transfer of funds across borders. 

Why do they have a problem with **illegal activities**? Bcs they don’t think anyone else should be doing it. From 2017 to 2020, criminal economic activities were overwhelmingly conducted by [traditional financial institutions](https://www.cryptoforinnovation.org/resources/Analysis_of_Bitcoin_in_Illicit_Finance.pdf). [Research](https://ciphertrace.com/2020-year-end-cryptocurrency-crime-and-anti-money-laundering-report/) shows that crypto is not the primary currency for illegal activities. FIAT is. Also, a major part of illegal activities were related to scams, not terrorism or drugs. Remember all those clickbait articles that say a major part of crypto is related to illegal activities? Well, turns out it was clickbait. It fell from a staggering 2,1% in 2019 to half of percent (rounded UP) in 2020. Source [here](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-crypto-crime-report-intro-ransomware-scams-darknet-markets).

What about **transfer of funds**? Again, this is their territory and they want to protect their business model. Financial institutions are responsible for laundering [$1.6 trillion EACH YEAR](https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/financing/facti-interim-report.html). The entirety of crypto is worth slightly above $2 trillion (and we just entered this). They do $1.6 T EACH YEAR. 

Out of top 10 banks in the world, four are Chinese (**ICBC, China Construction Bank Corp, Agricultural bank of China and Bank of China**). All of those had their own issues with crypto. It’s safe to say that the Party does not look favorably at anonymity or transparency. But why all the recent FUD from China (and their banks)? it’s because they have their own cryptocurrency out. China has been preparing the digital yuan for quite some time now and ICBC was the first to enable a feature that allows users to convert their digital yuan to cash on actual ATMs. 

Out of the remaining big banks we have Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, J.P. Morgan Chase, HSBC Holdings PLC, BNP Paribas, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. 

Let’s take a look at each.

&amp;#x200B;

Jamie Dimon (CEO of JP **Morgan Chase**) famously called BTC a fraud. Also:

\&gt;It’s worse than tulip bulbs. It won’t end well. Someone is going to get killed.”

A few months later…

\&gt;I regret making comments saying Bitcoin is a fraud. The blockchain is real. You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that. 

Why the sudden change of stance? Bcs of the fact that JP Morgan eventually unveiled access to several crypto funds.

Wait, I almost forgot. Shortly after that J.P. Morgan was reprimanded and fined $2 billion after skirting anti-money laundering rules. Since 2000, J.P. Morgan has paid over $29 billion in fines for offenses including toxic securities abuses, banking violations, anti-money laundering deficiencies, and market manipulation.

&amp;#x200B;

**HSBC** – banned customers [from buying stocks in companies that own crypto](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/258971/20210411/hsbc-to-prohibit-customers-from-getting-stocks-from-companies-holding-bitcoins-as-of-latest-policy.htm), barred them [from depositing profits](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bitcoin-holders-barred-from-depositing-profits-in-uk-banks-pgswbfrdz), etc. Well, they surely do it to protect their own customers from high risk plays. No, you guessed it, it’s bcs they want to impose high risk and illegal plays on their customers. Tax evasion, money laundering, cross border banking solicitation are their main business. Even [after paying record fines](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/hsbc-moved-vast-sums-of-dirty-money-after-paying-record-laundering-fine/), HSBC continued to provide banking services to criminals, Ponzi schemers, shell companies and drug traffickers. 

**BNP Paribas** – they have blocked transfers to crypto exchanges and banned customers from their banks for “buying bitcoin”. Couple of people here on Reddit also made posts on that. What is their main business, you ask? It’s the usual: [money laundering](https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20210521-bnp-paribas-charged-in-france-for-laundering-assets-linked-to-gabon-omar-bongo-atelier-74), [currency rigging](https://www.thetradenews.com/bnp-paribas-admits-fx-price-rigging-accepts-90-million-fine/), [criminal support of countries and entities engaged in acts of terrorism](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/bnp-paribas-agrees-plead-guilty-and-pay-89-billion-illegally-processing-financial) etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Bank of America** – their CEO famously said (in 2017)

\&gt;There ought to be a hard look at the policy of anonymous currencies, because the ability to track information of money flowing is one we use seriously against terrorism and as \[a tool\] against improper, illegal behavior.

Bank of America is one of the biggest fine collectors, with over $50 B in fines for breaking the rules and financial fraud. Also, surprise, surprise, [it's opened up a crypto fund to „selected clients“](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bofa-clients-crypto-exchange-traded-products-hedge-funds-report-2021-7). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Wells Fargo** \- [Unfortunately, we don't allow crypto transactions](https://twitter.com/Ask_WellsFargo/status/1149728891059261441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1149728891059261441%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcoinrivet.com%2Fwells-fargo-bans-customers-from-purchasing-cryptocurrency%2F), they said. Something about multiple risks associated with this volatile investment. 

Surely a bank that takes such good care about their customers would not be… wait? Fined numerous times for [long standing practice of illegal practice against their own clients](https://news.bitcoin.com/wells-fargo/)? That’s impossible. 

Oh, and yeah, [they launched a crypto fund. For the wealthy](https://www.coindesk.com/wells-fargo-nydig-passive-bitcoin-fund). And computer illiterate, I can only assume. 

&amp;#x200B;

Out of the big 10 banks, only for **Mitsubishi UFJ** could I not find any crypto hate (quick google fu, if anyone finds something, let me know and I’ll edit the post). They even launched [their own cryptocurrency](https://www.coindesk.com/japans-banking-giant-mufg-plans-to-launch-blockchain-payment-network-in-2021) and blockchain payment network, and have recently partnered with Coinbase. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

OK, let's take a look at some of the ""smaller"" ones. And other types of financial institutions: 

&amp;#x200B;

**GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC.**

Their chief investment strategist said: 

\&gt;Something with a long-term volatility of 80% can’t be considered a medium of exchange. Just because everybody piles into an idea and talks it up doesn’t mean it’s a store of value.

&amp;#x200B;

And their COO said: 

\&gt; The Bitcoin system today has no transparency to it. So there are a lot of people that question, why would you need a system that does not have an audit trail. \[It\] lacks some of the basic integrity of a real market.”

&amp;#x200B;

That was the talk before, you guessed it, they [unveiled a crypto trading team](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/goldman-sachs-unveils-new-cryptocurrency-trading-team-in-employee-memo.html) and said that crypto [should be a new asset class](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/podcasts/episodes/06-01-2021-crypto-a-new-asset-class.html).  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Danske Bank** is another notoriously anti-bitcoin bank. At one point the bank released an open letter on its website, urging its customers to avoid cryptocurrencies due to their potential for criminal activity, even stating that they have an *obligation to assist in the fight against financial crime and money laundering.* Of course that Danske was involved in [laundering approximately $235 billion](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/21/is-money-laundering-scandal-at-danske-bank-the-largest-in-history) through just one of its branches in Estonia over the course of eight years. Danske wasn’t working alone. In fact, because many of the transactions involved U.S. dollars, the scheme needed help from banks with access to the Federal Reserve’s Fedwire electronic settlement system. It is alleged that J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup’s Moscow branch had all sent or received funds tied to the scandal.

&amp;#x200B;

Torbjorn Magnusson of **Nordea bank** said: 

\&gt;For Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to be mainstream, they would have to be regulated, wouldn’t they? So that’s a step that is clearly missing.”

&amp;#x200B;

Jan 2018, Nordea bank get caught in money laundering scandal. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Director of GLOBAL MACRO, **FIDELITY INVESTMENTS**

\&gt;Even the insiders in that industry don’t really know where it’s going and it’s going to take some time. And for the average investor, you know, buyer beware because you need to do your homework and it’s tough; there’s a very high learning curve to figure out exactly what this all means.”

&amp;#x200B;

What do I read from this? They appeal to their customer base, who is not well versed in using a keyboard and a mouse. That’s why they [offer those services themselves](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/fidelity-to-launch-bitcoin-etf-as-investment-giant-builds-its-digital-asset-business-.html) in the form of ETFs. You know, for the good of their clients. 

&amp;#x200B;

April this year, **Peter Thiel** said: 

\&gt;“I do wonder whether at this point, Bitcoin should also be thought \[of\] in part as a Chinese financial weapon against the U.S. It threatens fiat money, but it especially threatens the U.S. dollar. \[If\] China’s long Bitcoin, perhaps from a geopolitical perspective, the U.S. should be asking some tougher questions about exactly how that works.” 

4 months later: [crypto broker platform backed by Thiel](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/17/peter-thiel-backed-crypto-broker-bitpanda-triples-valuation.html) receives further funding, valuated at $4 billion. Wait. What? I thought crypto was bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Charles Munger of **BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC**. said

\&gt;I never considered for one second having anything to do with it. I detested it the moment it was raised. It’s just disgusting. Bitcoin is noxious poison.”

&amp;#x200B;

Buffet is famously against BTC and crypto. But he doesn’t exactly hate money. Berkshire Hathaway invested in a [pro BTC digital bank](https://news.bitcoin.com/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-invests-bitcoin-friendly-nubank/)

&amp;#x200B;

Chairman of **SOCIETE GENERALE SA**

\&gt;We will discover that behind this Bitcoin scam, some funds were channeled maybe to finance terrorism and at that point, we will wake up and realize that this is not appropriate.

That’s… somewhat hypocritical, coming from the bank that paid several billions of dollar for **illegal** transactions to parties in countries subject to embargoes. Also, they launched their own [blockchain on Tezos](https://www.societegenerale.com/en/news/press-release/first-structured-product-public-blockchain)

&amp;#x200B;

And one of the most mentioned ones here on this sub, none other than **Blackrock**. 

\&gt;Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Coming from the words of their CEO in October 2017 . SO how come you have [$400 mill in mining stocks](https://www.coindesk.com/blackrock-has-almost-400m-invested-in-bitcoin-mining-stocks-report)?

&amp;#x200B;

Gita Gopinath – **chief economist at IMF**, and a heavy shill for USD. 

\&gt;*The more people use the BTC, the more useful it becomes to everyone else. This has been reinforced as emerging markets, which rely extensively on the BTC, increase their share of global economic activity*. 

Wait, no, I made an error. She said those things about the $, not BTC. Her main point about the USD is basically the adoption. Can't see why the same cannot be applied to BTC. 

&amp;#x200B;

One particular individual said the following: 

\&gt; It’s a bubble. Currencies to be exchangeable have to be backed by something. I do not understand where the backing of Bitcoin is coming from. There is no fundamental issue of capabilities of repaying it in anything which is universally accepteable, which is either intrinsic value of the currency or the credit or the trust of the individual who is issuing the money, whether it’s a government or an individual.

His name is Alan Greenspan, and he is responsible for the worldwide economic crisis and subsequent collapse in 2008. It caused trillions in economic damage as well as countless lives ruined. Fuck that guy in particular. 

&amp;#x200B;

What does all of this show us is that the agenda is there. Crypto is the solution to their decades of illegal and fraudulent practices. The jig is up. This is their swan songs. And it cannot stop sooner."

It is the third decentralized giant to announce a deployment on the Ava Labs project in recent days - a week earlier, the Aave liquidity protocol and large AMM Curve Finance announced the same.   

All of this is happening as part of the $180 million Avalanche Rush incentive program. The AVAX platform's native token has responded to the increased attention with a 156 percent uptick in price over the past seven days ($49.36 at the time of publication). Avalanche's market capitalization jumped from a fairly stable $3.5 billion to $8.76 billion today during the same time frame."

I have been really stressed the passed week as i am entering my final year of classes. I am currently a Finance Major just 3 classes away from graduating but with my current situation thisll take me till either winter or next spring to complete. I am currently trying my hardest to complete these 3 courses this semester but classes have been full and waitlisting seems to not be promising (hoping people drop courses when the semester starts). Im 22 and I feel like I am behind the curve with my peers and I cant help but compare myself to them and this adds on to my stress:/. With that being said I don’t even want to pursue a career in Finance as much as I did before growing up.

Should I do the MBA or EMBA?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/pb4nbp/i_have_the_age_of_an_mba_applicant_but_with_work/,christianrojoisme,1,2021-08-25 13:18:41,12,/r/MBA/comments/pb4nbp/i_have_the_age_of_an_mba_applicant_but_with_work/,Profile Review,"I am 29 years old (closing on 30) and I am deliberating as to whether I should take the EMBA or the MBA. I come from a third world country so I would prefer the MBA as that is cheaper and has a much clearer pathway for a location change which would allow me to pay my student debts. Though I would also be open to an EMBA

The dilemma is that currently in my company, I hold a Finance Director role where I hold oversight over the entire Financial Operations: Corporate Finance, Accounting, IT, Operations, etc and have 24 people under me (3 direct reports and 21 indirect reports). I am the most senior Finance person in the organization reporting to the CEO.

With that in mind, would an MBA or an EMBA work better for me? My main reason is to work in a much larger market and be exposed to some new complex problems such as in sustainability and digital transformation. While my current role may be high impact, I do see a natural limit as the market that I am in is behind the curve in such matters and I feel to be very competitive later on, a short stint abroad in a good role would do wonders for me and the EMBA/MBA would be an excellent springboard for such."

Find out what are the main DeFi networks available in the cryptocurrency market,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReefDeFi/comments/pbskb4/find_out_what_are_the_main_defi_networks/,yokesh351,1,2021-08-26 12:53:20,3,/r/ReefDeFi/comments/pbskb4/find_out_what_are_the_main_defi_networks/,NaN,"As already presented in other series, the universe of decentralized finance (DeFi) is quite wide. With this, the investor can have access to a wide range of financial services and products and even investments in works of art, such as NFT. However, what are the most secure and reliable DeFi protocols on this market? Many DeFi protocols have come under attack throughout 2021. This type of failure often causes both direct token theft and massive price devaluation. In either case, the investor can suffer huge losses if he invests in an unknown or poorly secure protocol.

Therefore, this text will present the main networks and protocols that exist in the DeFi market. Through them, it will be possible to start your research and investments with more security and practicality. In this text, we are going to know and understand more about these protocols, the most known of which are the following:

* AAVE ;
* Maker ;
* Compound ;
* Curve Finance;
* Synthetix ;
* Chainlink ;
* Uniswap .

Main DeFi Networks and Protocol Types Currently, most DeFi protocols basically work on two networks: Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Other networks, such as Chainlink (LINK) and Cardano (ADA) are taking their first steps, but they still do not have large shares of this market. Generally speaking, DeFi protocols can be divided into the following categories:

* loan protocols;
* Yield Farming Protocols;
* Decentralized Exchanges (DEX);
* Asset tokenization;
* Arts and NFTs negotiation;
* Derivatives.

As presented in the first text in this series, one way to see which DeFi projects are safer is through the Total Allocated Value (TLV). The projects with the most money allocated from this list are also often the most used and safest. Therefore, they are the ones we will see later in this text.

In addition, it is important to assess which platforms are most sought after by investors. The aforementioned DeFi Pulse website, for example, brings the projects in order of TLV and also by categories. It is possible to deduce from the table below that, among other things, the most sought after modality by investors in DeFi is loans. After all, five of the ten protocols with the highest TLV are focused on this modality.

After loans, decentralized exchanges (DEX) appear with three projects among the largest. That is, 80% of the largest DeFi protocols are exchanges or borrowing platforms. Therefore, the great demand of investors is for 1) platforms that make it possible to receive returns on capital, and; 2) places to trade DeFi tokens.

Most of these projects run on Ethereum, the network that pioneered the popularization of DeFi and smart contracts. However, other networks have shown growth and, as a result, have stolen market shares. The main one, let's get to know the best known and most valuable projects within the [development of Ethereum ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development)network.

## AAVE

AAVE is a liquidity protocol that allows investors to earn interest by borrowing their cryptoactives . This protocol is non-custodial, that is, the borrowed crypto actives are under the custody of their owner and not of AAVE. In addition, the platform is decentralized and open source.

The protocol supports borrowing with various tokens, including stablecoins and other DeFi tokens. In this sense, AAVE brings a new investment option, especially for long-term holders. With the protocol, these investors can place their tokens to earn interest, thus generating passive income.

In this process, the entire operation is done through the connection of the wallets with the AAVE protocol. Thus, there is no need to transfer ownership of the tokens to a platform or place them in the custody of third parties. As there are no deposits, the protocol has no funds that can be stolen by hackers, for example

In other words, the AAVE is a safe way to create savings or passive income with cryptocurrencies. Interest rates are usually attractive, in many cases exceeding the double digits per year, and mostly compound interest. This is currently the largest DeFi protocol in terms of allocated value, with over $19 billion.

## Maker (MKR)

The MKR is the token that feeds the Maker, also known as the MakerDAO. As the name implies, MakerDAO functions as an Autonomous Decentralized Organization (DAO). In turn, this network is responsible for managing and issuing one of the best known stablecoins on the market: DAI.

DAI, in turn, is a stablecoin native to the DeFi market. Like the protocol, DAI is decentralized and, unlike centralized stablecoins like USDT and USDC, does not have a central company or issuer. Therefore, network tokens cannot be confiscated or blocked.

Within the DeFi ecosystem, DAI serves as a way for investors to obtain a stable currency without having to sell their cryptocurrencies. For example, imagine an investor who has Ether ( ETH ), needs to borrow money, but doesn't want to get rid of his cryptocurrencies. He can borrow dollars via DAI, using his ETH tokens as collateral.

With this, the investor can use his position in ETH to obtain dollars via DAI. Such an operation has two clear advantages. The first is that there is no need to sell ETH. The second is a consequence of the first, since, by not selling the tokens, the investor will not have to pay capital gain taxes and other fees that could be charged in the transaction.

In addition, the MKR and DAI can be borrowed on multiple platforms, earning interest to their holders. The protocol was conceived in 2015 and launched in 2017. Since then, both the network and stablecoin have grown exponentially in value, reaching, at the time of writing this text, US$ 7.35 billion in allocated value.

## Compound (COMP)

Compound is another protocol that operates in the loans and interest segment. You can borrow or borrow up to 14 tokens, including stablecoins and DeFi tokens. The platform was also launched in 2018 and, since then, it has grown significantly both in use and in allocated value.

There are a number of liquidity pools in Compound and you can invest in one or more of them. When making this loan, the platform gives in exchange cTokens, which represent the amount invested. If you want to redeem your capital, the investor sells these tokens and redeems the invested capital.

Each token has its cToken version. Thus, whoever applies ETH in the protocol receives cETH, USDT applications yield cUSDT, and so on. Over time, the exchange rate of these cTokens against the underlying crypto-asset increases, and the investor can redeem them for more than the amount initially invested. This is how the protocol distributes your interest, whose fees can be seen on the website itself.

## Uniswap (UNI)

Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX) is a protocol used to exchange tokens created in the Ethereum blockchain. These exchanges are carried out in an automated way through smart contracts. Created in 2020, Uniswap saw its popularity explode along with DeFi and the launch of the UNI token in 2020.

As a DEX, Uniswap does not hold custody of any token traded on the platform. For trades to take place, the platform has people who use their tokens to provide liquidity to each traded pair. They are known as liquidity providers.

In exchange for providing liquidity, providers are rewarded with part of the fees charged by Uniswap. In this sense, DEX pays only transaction fees charged by the platform. In other words, trading through Uniswap provides lower costs and, with automation, more agility in operations.

## Yearn.finance (YFI)

The yearn.finance protocol was one of the first to take advantage of the rise of DeFi. It acts as an investment aggregator that enables investors to seek the best yields on the market. The protocol uses automation to always find the highest rates, boosting profitability for liquidity providers.

The project was launched in February 2020 and was an almost immediate success. In just three months, the YFI token came to cost US$ 82,745, a historic high reached in May. By way of comparison, the BTC cost $8,804 at the same time. In other words, YFI was worth almost ten times more than the main cryptocurrency on the market.

Even today, yearn.finance is one of the best known DeFi income projects. Although it lost space, the protocol made history by calling attention to the advantages of the DeFi market. Besides, of course, it was one of the few tokens in history that managed to surpass the unit value of BTC.

## Synthetix (SNX)

The name Synthetix comes from the English word Synthetic, which means synthetic. The word itself was a great inspiration for what the platform does: creating synthetic assets. In other words, Synthetix creates tokens that represent real assets such as stocks, derivatives, or even cryptocurrencies.

The network was launched in 2017 through Ethereum, but gained prominence from 2020. The protocol works through synths, synthetic assets that can replicate almost anything, from the price of oil and cryptocurrencies to the highest stock indexes in the world .

Synths track and provide returns based on the underlying asset without requiring the investor to directly hold the asset. In this way, Synthetix provides access to traditional market investments through tokenization. The protocol has advantages such as security, 24-hour operation and fast liquidity.

Other DeFi Networks So far, the protocols seen in this text have been built on Ethereum, which is, in fact, the main core network for DeFi. However, Ethereum also has its limitations, especially in the high price of fees, which brought difficulties for small investors. In this sense, other DeFi networks started to gain space in the market.

Networks like Polygon – formerly Matic – seek to increase the scalability of Ethereum and have grown in value. Others, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), have lower rates as one of their differentials. As a result, projects with less capital can run their operations without having to worry that network congestion will increase transaction prices.

Recently, BSC broke its daily transaction record by reaching more than 12 million transactions on July 29, 2021. The amount was almost ten times greater than transactions handled by Ethereum on the same day, as shown in the chart below. This achievement demonstrates not only the growth of the network, but the demand that still exists in the DeFi market.

Finally, the [development of the DeFi](https://www.blockchainx.tech/decentralized-finance-defi-development) ecosystem is quite broad, which means that new projects are always popping up. At the same time, protocols that seemed promising disappear or lose relevance. Keeping up to date and paying attention to which networks are more or less secure is essential for investors to be able to keep their capital protected and, at the same time, not be left out of this great revolution."

This type of failure often causes both direct token theft and massive price devaluation. In either case, the investor can suffer huge losses if he invests in an unknown or poorly secure protocol.

Therefore, this text will present the main networks and protocols that exist in the DeFi market. Through them, it will be possible to start your research and investments with more security and practicality. In this text, we are going to know and understand more about these protocols, the most known of which are the following:

* AAVE ;
* Maker ;
* Compound ;
* Curve Finance;
* Synthetix ;
* Chainlink ;
* Uniswap .

Main DeFi Networks and Protocol Types Currently, most DeFi protocols basically work on two networks: Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Other networks, such as Chainlink (LINK) and Cardano (ADA) are taking their first steps, but they still do not have large shares of this market. Generally speaking, DeFi protocols can be divided into the following categories:

* loan protocols;
* Yield Farming Protocols;
* Decentralized Exchanges (DEX);
* Asset tokenization;
* Arts and NFTs negotiation;
* Derivatives.

As presented in the first text in this series, one way to see which DeFi projects are safer is through the Total Allocated Value (TLV). The projects with the most money allocated from this list are also often the most used and safest. Therefore, they are the ones we will see later in this text.

In addition, it is important to assess which platforms are most sought after by investors. The aforementioned DeFi Pulse website, for example, brings the projects in order of TLV and also by categories. It is possible to deduce from the table below that, among other things, the most sought after modality by investors in DeFi is loans. After all, five of the ten protocols with the highest TLV are focused on this modality.

After loans, decentralized exchanges (DEX) appear with three projects among the largest. That is, 80% of the largest DeFi protocols are exchanges or borrowing platforms. Therefore, the great demand of investors is for 1) platforms that make it possible to receive returns on capital, and; 2) places to trade DeFi tokens.

Most of these projects run on Ethereum, the network that pioneered the popularization of DeFi and smart contracts. However, other networks have shown growth and, as a result, have stolen market shares. The main one, let's get to know the best known and most valuable projects within the [development of Ethereum ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development)network.

## AAVE

AAVE is a liquidity protocol that allows investors to earn interest by borrowing their cryptoactives . This protocol is non-custodial, that is, the borrowed crypto actives are under the custody of their owner and not of AAVE. In addition, the platform is decentralized and open source.

The protocol supports borrowing with various tokens, including stablecoins and other DeFi tokens. In this sense, AAVE brings a new investment option, especially for long-term holders. With the protocol, these investors can place their tokens to earn interest, thus generating passive income.

In this process, the entire operation is done through the connection of the wallets with the AAVE protocol. Thus, there is no need to transfer ownership of the tokens to a platform or place them in the custody of third parties. As there are no deposits, the protocol has no funds that can be stolen by hackers, for example

In other words, the AAVE is a safe way to create savings or passive income with cryptocurrencies. Interest rates are usually attractive, in many cases exceeding the double digits per year, and mostly compound interest. This is currently the largest DeFi protocol in terms of allocated value, with over $19 billion.

## Maker (MKR)

The MKR is the token that feeds the Maker, also known as the MakerDAO. As the name implies, MakerDAO functions as an Autonomous Decentralized Organization (DAO). In turn, this network is responsible for managing and issuing one of the best known stablecoins on the market: DAI.

DAI, in turn, is a stablecoin native to the DeFi market. Like the protocol, DAI is decentralized and, unlike centralized stablecoins like USDT and USDC, does not have a central company or issuer. Therefore, network tokens cannot be confiscated or blocked.

Within the DeFi ecosystem, DAI serves as a way for investors to obtain a stable currency without having to sell their cryptocurrencies. For example, imagine an investor who has Ether ( ETH ), needs to borrow money, but doesn't want to get rid of his cryptocurrencies. He can borrow dollars via DAI, using his ETH tokens as collateral.

With this, the investor can use his position in ETH to obtain dollars via DAI. Such an operation has two clear advantages. The first is that there is no need to sell ETH. The second is a consequence of the first, since, by not selling the tokens, the investor will not have to pay capital gain taxes and other fees that could be charged in the transaction.

In addition, the MKR and DAI can be borrowed on multiple platforms, earning interest to their holders. The protocol was conceived in 2015 and launched in 2017. Since then, both the network and stablecoin have grown exponentially in value, reaching, at the time of writing this text, US$ 7.35 billion in allocated value.

## Compound (COMP)

Compound is another protocol that operates in the loans and interest segment. You can borrow or borrow up to 14 tokens, including stablecoins and DeFi tokens. The platform was also launched in 2018 and, since then, it has grown significantly both in use and in allocated value.

There are a number of liquidity pools in Compound and you can invest in one or more of them. When making this loan, the platform gives in exchange cTokens, which represent the amount invested. If you want to redeem your capital, the investor sells these tokens and redeems the invested capital.

Each token has its cToken version. Thus, whoever applies ETH in the protocol receives cETH, USDT applications yield cUSDT, and so on. Over time, the exchange rate of these cTokens against the underlying crypto-asset increases, and the investor can redeem them for more than the amount initially invested. This is how the protocol distributes your interest, whose fees can be seen on the website itself.

## Uniswap (UNI)

Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX) is a protocol used to exchange tokens created in the Ethereum blockchain. These exchanges are carried out in an automated way through smart contracts. Created in 2020, Uniswap saw its popularity explode along with DeFi and the launch of the UNI token in 2020.

As a DEX, Uniswap does not hold custody of any token traded on the platform. For trades to take place, the platform has people who use their tokens to provide liquidity to each traded pair. They are known as liquidity providers.

In exchange for providing liquidity, providers are rewarded with part of the fees charged by Uniswap. In this sense, DEX pays only transaction fees charged by the platform. In other words, trading through Uniswap provides lower costs and, with automation, more agility in operations.

## Yearn.finance (YFI)

The yearn.finance protocol was one of the first to take advantage of the rise of DeFi. It acts as an investment aggregator that enables investors to seek the best yields on the market. The protocol uses automation to always find the highest rates, boosting profitability for liquidity providers.

The project was launched in February 2020 and was an almost immediate success. In just three months, the YFI token came to cost US$ 82,745, a historic high reached in May. By way of comparison, the BTC cost $8,804 at the same time. In other words, YFI was worth almost ten times more than the main cryptocurrency on the market.

Even today, yearn.finance is one of the best known DeFi income projects. Although it lost space, the protocol made history by calling attention to the advantages of the DeFi market. Besides, of course, it was one of the few tokens in history that managed to surpass the unit value of BTC.

## Synthetix (SNX)

The name Synthetix comes from the English word Synthetic, which means synthetic. The word itself was a great inspiration for what the platform does: creating synthetic assets. In other words, Synthetix creates tokens that represent real assets such as stocks, derivatives, or even cryptocurrencies.

The network was launched in 2017 through Ethereum, but gained prominence from 2020. The protocol works through synths, synthetic assets that can replicate almost anything, from the price of oil and cryptocurrencies to the highest stock indexes in the world .

Synths track and provide returns based on the underlying asset without requiring the investor to directly hold the asset. In this way, Synthetix provides access to traditional market investments through tokenization. The protocol has advantages such as security, 24-hour operation and fast liquidity.

Other DeFi Networks So far, the protocols seen in this text have been built on Ethereum, which is, in fact, the main core network for DeFi. However, Ethereum also has its limitations, especially in the high price of fees, which brought difficulties for small investors. In this sense, other DeFi networks started to gain space in the market.

Networks like Polygon – formerly Matic – seek to increase the scalability of Ethereum and have grown in value. Others, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), have lower rates as one of their differentials. As a result, projects with less capital can run their operations without having to worry that network congestion will increase transaction prices.

Recently, BSC broke its daily transaction record by reaching more than 12 million transactions on July 29, 2021. The amount was almost ten times greater than transactions handled by Ethereum on the same day, as shown in the chart below. This achievement demonstrates not only the growth of the network, but the demand that still exists in the DeFi market.

Finally, the [development of the DeFi](https://www.blockchainx.tech/decentralized-finance-defi-development) ecosystem is quite broad, which means that new projects are always popping up. At the same time, protocols that seemed promising disappear or lose relevance. Keeping up to date and paying attention to which networks are more or less secure is essential for investors to be able to keep their capital protected and, at the same time, not be left out of this great revolution."

The main one, let's get to know the best known and most valuable projects within the [development of Ethereum ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development)network.

## AAVE

AAVE is a liquidity protocol that allows investors to earn interest by borrowing their cryptoactives . This protocol is non-custodial, that is, the borrowed crypto actives are under the custody of their owner and not of AAVE. In addition, the platform is decentralized and open source.

The protocol supports borrowing with various tokens, including stablecoins and other DeFi tokens. In this sense, AAVE brings a new investment option, especially for long-term holders. With the protocol, these investors can place their tokens to earn interest, thus generating passive income.

In this process, the entire operation is done through the connection of the wallets with the AAVE protocol. Thus, there is no need to transfer ownership of the tokens to a platform or place them in the custody of third parties. As there are no deposits, the protocol has no funds that can be stolen by hackers, for example

In other words, the AAVE is a safe way to create savings or passive income with cryptocurrencies. Interest rates are usually attractive, in many cases exceeding the double digits per year, and mostly compound interest. This is currently the largest DeFi protocol in terms of allocated value, with over $19 billion.

## Maker (MKR)

The MKR is the token that feeds the Maker, also known as the MakerDAO. As the name implies, MakerDAO functions as an Autonomous Decentralized Organization (DAO). In turn, this network is responsible for managing and issuing one of the best known stablecoins on the market: DAI.

DAI, in turn, is a stablecoin native to the DeFi market. Like the protocol, DAI is decentralized and, unlike centralized stablecoins like USDT and USDC, does not have a central company or issuer. Therefore, network tokens cannot be confiscated or blocked.

Within the DeFi ecosystem, DAI serves as a way for investors to obtain a stable currency without having to sell their cryptocurrencies. For example, imagine an investor who has Ether ( ETH ), needs to borrow money, but doesn't want to get rid of his cryptocurrencies. He can borrow dollars via DAI, using his ETH tokens as collateral.

With this, the investor can use his position in ETH to obtain dollars via DAI. Such an operation has two clear advantages. The first is that there is no need to sell ETH. The second is a consequence of the first, since, by not selling the tokens, the investor will not have to pay capital gain taxes and other fees that could be charged in the transaction.

In addition, the MKR and DAI can be borrowed on multiple platforms, earning interest to their holders. The protocol was conceived in 2015 and launched in 2017. Since then, both the network and stablecoin have grown exponentially in value, reaching, at the time of writing this text, US$ 7.35 billion in allocated value.

## Compound (COMP)

Compound is another protocol that operates in the loans and interest segment. You can borrow or borrow up to 14 tokens, including stablecoins and DeFi tokens. The platform was also launched in 2018 and, since then, it has grown significantly both in use and in allocated value.

There are a number of liquidity pools in Compound and you can invest in one or more of them. When making this loan, the platform gives in exchange cTokens, which represent the amount invested. If you want to redeem your capital, the investor sells these tokens and redeems the invested capital.

Each token has its cToken version. Thus, whoever applies ETH in the protocol receives cETH, USDT applications yield cUSDT, and so on. Over time, the exchange rate of these cTokens against the underlying crypto-asset increases, and the investor can redeem them for more than the amount initially invested. This is how the protocol distributes your interest, whose fees can be seen on the website itself.

## Uniswap (UNI)

Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX) is a protocol used to exchange tokens created in the Ethereum blockchain. These exchanges are carried out in an automated way through smart contracts. Created in 2020, Uniswap saw its popularity explode along with DeFi and the launch of the UNI token in 2020.

As a DEX, Uniswap does not hold custody of any token traded on the platform. For trades to take place, the platform has people who use their tokens to provide liquidity to each traded pair. They are known as liquidity providers.

In exchange for providing liquidity, providers are rewarded with part of the fees charged by Uniswap. In this sense, DEX pays only transaction fees charged by the platform. In other words, trading through Uniswap provides lower costs and, with automation, more agility in operations.

## Yearn.finance (YFI)

The yearn.finance protocol was one of the first to take advantage of the rise of DeFi. It acts as an investment aggregator that enables investors to seek the best yields on the market. The protocol uses automation to always find the highest rates, boosting profitability for liquidity providers.

The project was launched in February 2020 and was an almost immediate success. In just three months, the YFI token came to cost US$ 82,745, a historic high reached in May. By way of comparison, the BTC cost $8,804 at the same time. In other words, YFI was worth almost ten times more than the main cryptocurrency on the market.

Even today, yearn.finance is one of the best known DeFi income projects. Although it lost space, the protocol made history by calling attention to the advantages of the DeFi market. Besides, of course, it was one of the few tokens in history that managed to surpass the unit value of BTC.

## Synthetix (SNX)

The name Synthetix comes from the English word Synthetic, which means synthetic. The word itself was a great inspiration for what the platform does: creating synthetic assets. In other words, Synthetix creates tokens that represent real assets such as stocks, derivatives, or even cryptocurrencies.

The network was launched in 2017 through Ethereum, but gained prominence from 2020. The protocol works through synths, synthetic assets that can replicate almost anything, from the price of oil and cryptocurrencies to the highest stock indexes in the world .

Synths track and provide returns based on the underlying asset without requiring the investor to directly hold the asset. In this way, Synthetix provides access to traditional market investments through tokenization. The protocol has advantages such as security, 24-hour operation and fast liquidity.

Other DeFi Networks So far, the protocols seen in this text have been built on Ethereum, which is, in fact, the main core network for DeFi. However, Ethereum also has its limitations, especially in the high price of fees, which brought difficulties for small investors. In this sense, other DeFi networks started to gain space in the market.

Networks like Polygon – formerly Matic – seek to increase the scalability of Ethereum and have grown in value. Others, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), have lower rates as one of their differentials. As a result, projects with less capital can run their operations without having to worry that network congestion will increase transaction prices.

Recently, BSC broke its daily transaction record by reaching more than 12 million transactions on July 29, 2021. The amount was almost ten times greater than transactions handled by Ethereum on the same day, as shown in the chart below. This achievement demonstrates not only the growth of the network, but the demand that still exists in the DeFi market.

Finally, the [development of the DeFi](https://www.blockchainx.tech/decentralized-finance-defi-development) ecosystem is quite broad, which means that new projects are always popping up. At the same time, protocols that seemed promising disappear or lose relevance. Keeping up to date and paying attention to which networks are more or less secure is essential for investors to be able to keep their capital protected and, at the same time, not be left out of this great revolution."

# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to Icmagroup, the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.

Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.

These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.

When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds  
This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds  
These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds  
This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds.  
Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

# Decentralised Bond

## Definition

By definition, it is clear that decentralised bond has the same meaning as traditional bond. Some of the differences include the time to maturity, the yield, and the ability to combine to create many different products and serve different purposes.

 

**TLDR**:

Recently, the cryptocurrency market has become more and more exciting because of the rapid increase in the number of new participants. In the current situation of extremely low bank interest rates, more and more people with a demand for ""fixed interest rate loans of 10% a year"" will step into this market.

Applications like Outlet, Linus, Dharma, BlockFi, Celsius have developed user interfaces to meet this need, with liquidity coming from centralised liquidity pools or from Compound and Aave. Therefore, users' attention to decentralised fixed-rate products will be even greater."

# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to Icmagroup, the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds. Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

BARBERSHOP.FINANCE - ULTIMATE OFFICIALLY UNOFFICIAL GUIDE,https://www.reddit.com/r/BarbershopFinance/comments/pbuxb2/barbershopfinance_ultimate_officially_unofficial/,alpha___rho,1,2021-08-26 15:58:07,0,/r/BarbershopFinance/comments/pbuxb2/barbershopfinance_ultimate_officially_unofficial/,NaN,"""Visiting a Barbershop is not only about cuts and shaves. Barbershop should be a safe harbour and an experience."" - Alpha Rho

*This article will be updated as Barbershop team add more features to their platform.*

# FACTS:

* Barbershop is a yield farm launched on Aug 12, 22:00h UTC on Polygon chain
* $HAIR is a native token to Barbershop
* Barbershop is an ApeSwap's BUIDL candidate and it's using ApeSwap as its DEX
* One of the founders of Barbershop, ApeelingApe, has also contributed to the ApeSwap dex via frontend development enhancements
* ***It’s not just a haircut, it’s a DeFi experience***

# $HAIR tokenomics

Barbershop started with a $HAIR growth frenzy;

* 40 $HAIR/block at 0.05$ on launch
* after 48 hours, hair growth was reduced to 30 $HAIR/block
* after another 48 hours, hair growth was reduced to 20 $HAIR/block

After the frenzy, hair will start growing based on the total supply:

* 20 $HAIR/block if circulating supply &lt; 50M
* 15 $HAIR/block if circulating supply between 50M and 70M
* 10 $HAIR/block if circulating supply between 70M and 85M
* 5 $HAIR/block if circulating supply between 85M and 95M
* 2.5 $HAIR/block if circulating supply between 95M and 100M
* 1 $HAIR/block if circulating supply &gt; 100M

Although there is no hard cap on the token supply and the token is inflationary, this decreasing curve will over time form a soft cap on the token.

**Marketing**

100,000 $HAIR was allocated for marketing collaborations and giveaways.

**Fees**

Deposit fees are used to fund marketing campaigns, support the dev team, buy back and burn tokens, and run pools on other farms. Fees are also an incentive to support the token longer term, and help prevent arbitrage bots.

**Burns**

Burns will be conducted manually from the dev pool. Over time plan is to roll out burn mechanisms baked into future contracts.

# CUTS, SHAVES, TRIM

**TL;DR:**

* Cuts = Farms
* Shaves = Pools
* Trim = Harvest

In the cluttered yield farming ecosystem it’s hard to stay up to date with the hottest crops. Barbershop Finance differentiates itself from the pack by encouraging people to “grow what they know” — their hair!

This new spin on the concept of yield farming attracts users seeking to unleash their inner barber. Not everyone was born to work the land, but we can all appreciate a cascading flow. From afro to a-line, beehive to bouffant, luscious locks to bic’d bald — Barbershop patrons decide how to sculpt their $HAIR.

With a focus on ease of use, clean design, and relatable concepts, growing hair on the blockchain is a fun new way to introduce new and old users to automated market makers in a new light.

# WAITING ROOM

While waiting for your cut &amp; shave, you could play few games in the waiting room.

* Coin flip
* Dice
* Barbell roll
* Roulette

# NON FUNGIBLE CUTS (NFC)

OpenSea, the world’s biggest NFT marketplace, expects to see $1 billion in transaction volume this month, up from $300 million in July and $8 million in January.

“We are seeing a giant growth curve,” said Devin Finzer, co-founder of the platform, who expects up to 6 million people to browse the site this month, compared with 400,000 in January. He estimates that hundreds of thousands are buying and selling NFTs through the site monthly, up from tens of thousands in the beginning of the year.

###The projects are trying to replicated Beeple’s success of creating value through scarcity. DraftKings Inc. announced its own NFT marketplace with a slew of sports collectibles, including digital cards signed by football great Tom Brady. Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. launched a marketplace. Actors Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin have teamed up on Stoner Cats NFTs.

Some of the activity may also be driven by questionable practices. Some sellers are driving up prices via recycling.

Fake NFTs -- whereby someone copies an artist’s digital work, places it on the blockchain and sells it in the artist’s name as an NFT -- have become “a significant” problem.

“In the past, people probably flexed using a Rolex or expensive car,” said Tan, who lives in Singapore. “The new ‘it’ way to flex now is a very exclusive profile picture.”

###The market’s being recognized in a big way and the infrastructure getting built up makes it more sustainable. He recently bought an NFT whereby an artist will build him a model rocket -- one that shoots off toward the moon.

How I work with an investor on my indie card game,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/pbzzv8/how_i_work_with_an_investor_on_my_indie_card_game/,Vovun,1,2021-08-26 21:54:21,2,/r/gamedev/comments/pbzzv8/how_i_work_with_an_investor_on_my_indie_card_game/,NaN,"Hi, I'm Vovun, and I'm designing a deckbuilding roguelike game set in a Victorian mansion. In the sense that the action of the roguelike takes place in the mansion, I am located in the apartment and design it.

I want to share a history of development, particullary a social one - about relations with people, a team and a person who gives me money for development. Hope it'll be useful for you if you're looking for private investements for your game!

I will not be cunning. Partly, I'm writing all this to raise interest in the game. A high-quality game almost always requires investment. I don't like working with people ""on enthusiasm"" and want to continue making games in my studio. 

Therefore, if you like or don't like (perhaps, you suddenly fall in love) card roguelikes, Victorian mansions, walls of text with interesting characters, and choices of different romance routes, then wishlist Crawlyard on Steam. This will help build confidence and budget for the next development phase.

[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637560/Crawlyard/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637560/Crawlyard/)

I'm writing this post to share a story that I thought I would never end up in. The story of each game is unique, and mine begins in the summer of 2020.

I have been professionally engaged in game design for a long time (since 2014), but that summer, I lost my job (thanks, COVID) and decided to take the first steps towards releasing my own game. The reasons were clear — I often had terrible luck with producers, who were more interested in spending investor money on a new car or fancy apartments, instead of making a game. Don't think that I'm so selfless. I would also not mind getting my place or a car, but with my own money, which I will earn myself. Therefore, I wanted to lead the studio, which would not waste money on entertainment but constantly release new games until I retire or die.

While looking for freelance jobs, at the same time, I thought: What could I create that would be quite simple to execute and would not require many months of development? I liked Forward ([https://twotinydice.itch.io/forward](https://twotinydice.itch.io/forward)), a card game at itch.io that is beautiful in its simplicity. But I wanted to add a lot to this concept - I felt that one can increase the game's depth, while saving the easy to learn difficulty curve and controls, and also diversify the gameplay. Not every game needs new mechanics and ideas, but I wanted to see where else this concept could be moved. Therefore, without thinking twice, I got to work.

The idea was simple - make a 100% clone of Forward and then prototype different mechanics on top of it: another, deeper combat, party control instead of one hero, characters, plot, secret locations, an open world, even at some stage I collaborated with a wonderful writer (with whom I work now).

For me, the combat system was the most exciting thing - to make a deep but easy-to-manage battle. This is a big challenge, which (for me personally) was an indicator of your coolness as a game designer.

A variety of ideas were born: a switch from a turn-based to real-time when meeting an enemy, split of battle into physical/mental/social interactions. At some point, an idea emerged that became the foundation of the current game.

**""What if you just lay out the path for the hero with rooms, and they would walk along and fight by themselves?""**

Of course, I haven't finished anything - mired in everyday life and the need to earn money. I found a full-time job as a game designer consultant and later as a game designer lead. But the itch about the unfinished project remained. I tried to do something in the evenings, but the result was not enough - I wasn't good enough with the code, and there was simply no time to study complex algorithms. And then he appeared in my life ...**an Investor**.

In general, I have known Mr. I. for a long time - he also attended a coworking space, which I went to, where he invested in various startups. Before that, he even offered to invest in some of my projects - he was interested in working with game development. But I strategically refused because I was not ready to take other people's money and responsibility. Moreover, I was not sure that something would work out, and I did not want to spoil my reputation - I am to work with him, only on something I was confident about.

Stuck at a regular job, I again began to light up with the desire and motivation to get out of my comfort zone and make my own game. The essence of the plan was simple - to borrow money from someone for a programmer, make a small game, release it on Steam, earn a few hundred, return the money, and have a released project on Steam. I don't have any rich friends, so I decided to go with this proposal to Mr. I., for whom it won't be difficult to borrow a thousand dollars for a junior programmer. He agreed, but to my horror, put forward counter terms - no, not the terms like ""I'll break your kneecaps if you don't return it in 2 months."" It sounded much scarier.

**""Let's make a game we'll be proud of? Why would you waste time and do nothing when we can invest more and make a cool project we are proud of? ""**

The question of the amount and responsibility is the most terrible component here because even despite his words: ""Even if we screw up - it's okay,"" I didn't want to frame Mr. I. But, like any indie developer, I didn't want to refuse either.

We discussed the plan, outlined the stages we want to achieve, set the terms, and started development. Mr. I gave me money, I wrote the documentation and hired a coder. The investements were clear, yet sometimes he brought less than promised, saying ""Listen, I've spent 1/4 of it in pub"". Thanks anyway!

The goals were clear but far from simple:

* Make a demo and get to the summer Steam Next Fest to collect wishlists and understand the players' interest in the game
* Decide how much more budget to throw in and how to scale the final game
* From that, conclude whether we want to finish it at all, or try to do something else.

And we went to this goal for a month and a half. The graphics were entirely purchased from the asset store. There was no balance at all, but the mechanics were slowly developing, and we were preparing for the demo.

I understood at that moment that it would be far from other demos at the festival in terms of quality. Still, it was at least something from which you can collect the first reviews and understand whether we are making the game in the right direction to release, earn and return investments, and start the next project on a slightly larger scale.

Everything was fine until the first obstacle happened - the programmer disappeared without pushing a new code he had been writing during the last month. There were many changes that greatly influenced the gameplay and were supposed to provide core gameplay so that players did not spit and did not throw a demo, at least in the first stage.

Time was running out. An ass situation, in short, but giving up was not an option. **If I give up at this stage, I definitely don't deserve to run my own studio.**

To replace the missing developer, I collaborated with my friend, master of Unity 3d - expensive, but worth the money. With him, we tried to finish the demo. We did it partly. Sleeping all week for 3 hours, we were able to bring the prototype to a playable form. Spells and objects did not work there, the rooms differed only visually, but people played, under my supervision, of course. 

After the first playtest, I received good feedback. However, a second obstacle appeared - the demo was still raw, without content. It required my support, and as a result, we delayed and did not have time to prepare a demo for Steam Next Fest, so we canceled the application, and the game page was released as-is.

Nevertheless, it would help if you found positive sides, and there were many pros:

* We have much more time to add the demo to the next festival planned in October.
* We have time to properly work on the feedback after the festival and improve the game mechanics.
* In the two weeks Steam featured the game after the page's launch, we achieved the required number of wishlists, which was the goal set up with the investor.
* In general, we have very good indicators, even better than those that we planned - and this is purely from screenshot Saturdays, without paid advertising and PR
* The investor, seeing the dynamics, agreed to finance the development of the demo and pay salaries to the team, everyone except me - I continue to work at my main job. Probably it's fair.

At the moment our team consists of a game designer, programmer, screenwriter, artist, and jack of all trades, who helps us with everything from level design to trailers. After the end of 2 weeks of Steam featuring, we're tightly engaged in working on the game itself, finishing the core gameplay, pace, balance, and in general preparing for the demo, and we even appeared at Gamescom 2021!

I never knew how to write endings, so thanks for your attention. If this story wasn't useful for you, maybe at least it'll invoke the same drive in you that I had when started it all.

Right now my drive is ""Staying Alive""."
DeFi Explained: Lending &amp; borrowing,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pc1q8k/defi_explained_lending_borrowing/,Millybabyshund,1,2021-08-26 23:24:42,1,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pc1q8k/defi_explained_lending_borrowing/,NaN,"DeFi had recently breached a new milestone: after breaking $100 billion TVL, it managed to be the equivalent of a top 40 U.S. bank. New investors are moving their assets to DeFi on a daily basis. And at the time of writing, lending and borrowing platforms are becoming widely popular. Which brings us to the question: What is all the fuss about lending and borrowing in crypto? And who are the big players in this game?

&amp;#x200B;

What is crypto lending?

Crypto lending is an alternative investment form, where investors lend fiat money or cryptocurrencies to other borrowers in exchange for interest payments. This means there are two main parties involved in this loan:

&amp;#x200B;

The lender, who will receive interest from the borrower in exchange for the loan.

&amp;#x200B;

The borrower, who will deposit crypto-assets as collateral to secure the investor’s investment.

&amp;#x200B;

By depositing collateral, lenders can be sure that if something goes wrong the collateral will be used to compensate them. All DeFi lending services are based on blockchain, which is usually the Ethereum blockchain. This means that there are no traditional banks or custodians.

&amp;#x200B;

Why Crypto Loan Rates Are So Attractive

Traditional banking does not offer any attractive interest rates anymore. Some of them even go so far as to have a negative deposit rate. No wonder many investors are looking for more lucrative opportunities in search of passive income.

&amp;#x200B;

Cryptocurrency lending is still a topic of debate, but more and more people are turning to crypto loans as an alternative source of income. Interest rates can even go up to 30%. DeFi is a young and evolving market and the demand for it is constantly increasing. Borrowers can take out cryptocurrency-backed loans to ensure they have available funds while avoiding losing their exposure to specific crypto assets.

&amp;#x200B;

The lenders are those who help provide these loans to the borrowers through DeFi platforms, and often through centralized financing (CeFi) platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

It is no secret that DeFi has taken the crypto lending industry a significant step forward. Let’s take a look at the advantages:

&amp;#x200B;

All loans are provided through smart contracts. Every detail of the loan has been automated and verified.

&amp;#x200B;

DeFi lending does not require custody to perform any operation.

&amp;#x200B;

Income interest is automatically adjusted to the market.

&amp;#x200B;

The interest or collateral is collected automatically, so no need to worry if the deal goes wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, DeFi loans have proven to be a safe and easy way for investors to make their money work for them without breaking a sweat (that is if you don’t look at your investment every minute).

&amp;#x200B;

The Crypto Lending Ecosystem

While crypto lending platforms are not classified as banks, they can be centralized or decentralized entities such as Nexo, BlockFi, Celsius, Aave, [Yearn.finance](https://Yearn.finance) or Compound. These crypto lending platforms play the role of the middleman in both CeFi and DeFi.

&amp;#x200B;

Top crypto lending platforms in DeFi

Crypto lending platforms are springing up like mushrooms, which can be confusing for investors. So, for the sake of clarification, let’s review some of the well-known crypto lending platforms in DeFi:

&amp;#x200B;

Aave

The name Aave comes from the Finnish word for ""ghost"" and is a lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain.

&amp;#x200B;

The main feature of Aave is its open-source environment. It is a non-custodial protocol that allows for decentralized lending and borrowing. Lenders provide liquidity to the market to generate passive income, while borrowers can… well, borrow! After providing collateral of course.

&amp;#x200B;

Lenders earn from ERC20 compliant aTokens at a ratio of 1: 1 to the delivered assets. This means that while lending 36 Dai, they receive 36 aTokens (in this case, 36 aDai).

&amp;#x200B;

Interest rates are adjusted algorithmically based on supply and demand, but Aave allows borrowers to choose a stable interest rate (at any time) that changes less often. What makes Aave unique is its latest feature: flash loans. This feature allows borrowers to borrow any available amount of assets without collateral.

&amp;#x200B;

Compound

Compound is an algorithmic money market protocol on Ethereum that, like Aave, allows you to borrow or lend money and earn interest for providing collateral. The interest rates are automatically adjusted based on supply and demand.

&amp;#x200B;

As in the case of Aave, asset balances provided are represented by ERC20 minted tokens, but in Compound’s protocol they are called cTokens. When the investors received their cTokens, which is after providing collateral, they can borrow up to 50-75% of their cTokens value depending on the type of the underlying asset.

&amp;#x200B;

The Compound Protocol reserves 10% of the interest paid as reserves; everything else goes to the lenders.

&amp;#x200B;

[Yearn.finance](https://Yearn.finance)

The Yearn Finance platform communicates with several other DeFi protocols on the Ethereum blockchain with the aim of maximizing the investors’ returns. It can be described as an AI advisor for DeFi returns. Because of this, investors can earn the most from lending their stablecoins. Yearn works purely based on codes without a financial intermediary.

&amp;#x200B;

Yearn has an automatic reward system has been developed based on the YFI token. The Yearn platform consists of several products:

&amp;#x200B;

Earn - Earn indicates where the highest interest can be earned by lending a crypto asset. Earn searches across different lending protocols such as Balancer, Aave and Compound to find the best interest rate. Users can deposit DAI, USDC, USDT, TUSD or sUSD on the [yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance) platform to start earning interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Vaults - a collection of investment strategies designed to maximize returns from other DeFi projects and operate as actively managed investment funds. The use of these decentralized funds does not come without risks. The yDAI vault was robbed of $11 million dollars due to a vulnerability on February 5, 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

Zap - allows to combine and execute different trades with one click to save time and money. Thus, an investor can instantly trade DAI for yCRV in one click instead of three different actions across the [Yearn.finance](https://Yearn.finance) and the Curve Finance platform.

&amp;#x200B;

YFI tokens - Users can earn YFI tokens by placing cryptocurrencies in [Yearn.finance](https://Yearn.finance) contracts running on the Balancer and Curve DeFi trading platforms, which use the [Yearn.finance](https://Yearn.finance) platform.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of these features, [Yearn.finance](https://Yearn.finance) provides an extensive yield farming service that enables users to capture crypto assets in a DeFi protocol in order to automatically earn more cryptos and achieve better returns.

&amp;#x200B;

Top crypto lending platforms in CeFi

While writing this article, gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain are reaching absurdly high numbers. This makes investing in DeFi for smaller investors not profitable. They could, however, consider CeFi platforms. With CeFi, investors trust the people behind a business to ethically manage funds and execute on services the business is offering. This differs from DeFi, where investors trust that the technology will function as intended to execute on services being offered.

&amp;#x200B;

Nexo

Nexo is a cryptolending platform founded in 2018 by the same people that were behind Credissimo, which is an organization that has more than 10 years of experience in offering loans. It is probably the most known CeFi platform of this list. Like Compound and Aave, Nexo offers a service that allows you to act as both a borrower and a lender. The platform is especially interesting for investors who think that they currently receive too little interest on their savings account (which is everyone). At Nexo you receive up to 8% interest on your euros, dollars, pounds or stablecoins.

&amp;#x200B;

The benefits of Nexo are:

&amp;#x200B;

Fully licensed and regulated.

&amp;#x200B;

Insurance up to $ 100 million (BitGo Custody).

&amp;#x200B;

Fully automated platform.

&amp;#x200B;

Processed more than $ 1.5 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

8% interest for lenders.

&amp;#x200B;

Flexible loan with 5.6% interest for borrowers.

&amp;#x200B;

All loans are 100% covered.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s also worth noting that Nexo is developing a payment card called the Nexo card, which allows investors to spend the value of their digital assets without having to sell them.

&amp;#x200B;

[Block.fi](https://Block.fi)

BlockFi is a peer-to-peer credit marketplace that was founded in 2017 by a number of key figures from the financial sector. [Block.fi](https://Block.fi) supports the following coins: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and Chainlink. They also support USD stablecoins. Like the other platforms, interest can be compounded. BlockFi charges a withdrawal fee, which is deducted from the total withdrawal amount. Investors get 1 free withdrawal per month, so if you plan your withdrawals strategically, you pay no fees at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Celsius network

Although not fully supporting US investors, Celsius carved a name for itself. The Celsius Network was founded in 2017 by Alex Mashinsky (CEO), Daniel Leon (COO) and Nuke Goldstein (CTO). Celsius is currently working with \~250 large institutional investors. These companies borrow crypto from Celsius on which they pay an interest of 16%. That is a high interest rate, but that is because these companies often have no other choice, because they are limited by law. For example, most institutional investors are not allowed, to invest in crypto because of the volatility. This is circumvented by borrowing crypto. The companies deposit dollars as collateral, putting Celsius at minimal risk. This is also exactly how users can borrow from Celsius.

&amp;#x200B;

Of that 16% interest paid by Celsius' institutional clients, 80% goes to Celsius users. The amount of interest you get on your crypto depends on which crypto coin(s) you have deposited and your loyalty level. It is worth noting that as of writing, unlike Nexo and [Block.fi](https://Block.fi), Celsius has never been hacked, doesn’t have withdrawal fees and offers the highest lending interests (\~10%).

&amp;#x200B;

Final words

DeFi (and CeFi) crypto lending platforms are experiencing a hype that has attracted billions of dollars from investors. Based on these numbers, it can be concluded that migration from banking to blockchain and exchanges seems like a natural next step for the entire crypto niche and will most likely keep continuing and evolving."

Shibance | Multi-chain meme dex on BSC and KCC. Lotteries launching on the 1st (tickets available to buy now)! $20k initial incentive for the Lottery 🎰,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ietsistoptimist/comments/pe0aos/shibance_multichain_meme_dex_on_bsc_and_kcc/,ietsistoptimist,1,2021-08-30 02:04:17,0,/r/u_ietsistoptimist/comments/pe0aos/shibance_multichain_meme_dex_on_bsc_and_kcc/,NaN,"
‼️Lotteries and NFT farming coming very soon, IWOs (launchpad) not too long after that. Super secret game-changer code name: Project FLOOF in the works ‼️

To celebrate the launch of this much anticipated feature, the **initial funding for the Lottery is 800,000 in WOOF tokens!** This doesn’t include the extra tokens added from purchase of tickets so the prize pools are really nothing to be sniffed at!

Official Twitter announcement: https://twitter.com/shibance/status/1432014234053840900?s=21

*In this article I will explain why I think this could be your last chance to ever get Shibance tokens at this price again* 📈

I’ve done a lot of the DD leg work for you to save you some time but make sure to check it all out for yourself 🕵️‍♂️

**For the degenerates among you, yes you, I’ve added a TL;DR for each section to help you understand in a quick skim** 🦍⏩ 

#*Right around the corner for Shibance 🔜*

The lottery and NFT farming utilities are very close to being launched now. They will be launching on BSC first and half a month later will be added to the KCC network DEX as well. This coincides with the 2nd halvings for both chains, after which the halvings are yearly. 

If you don’t know why halvings can be such a positive event I’d suggest you have a look at BTC price action post-halving or any of the other numerous examples.

**TL;DR : more demand, less new tokens added to supply** 📈

//

#*First up - Lottery 🎰*

Launching on the 30th - the lottery prize pool is initially funded with a whopping 800,000 in WOOF tokens!! This comes to around $20,000 at the current price (but in a year that amount could make anyone very very happy). The lottery system looks amazing and with the chance to win so many tokens you could leapfrog a whole load of long term investors with just one win! I know where some of my staking rewards are going!

Prize tiers that haven’t been won will be rolled over into the next lottery to keep that jackpot going!

**Oh, and it burns!!** 20% of the funds for the lottery pools will be allocated for burns - introducing another deflationary mechanism to the tokenomic structure of Shibance. Even if you’re not the lottery type, who doesn’t like stuff that makes each of your tokens more valuable!

**TL;DR: Chance to win big, inbuilt deflationary element to control supply and make your tokens more valuable** 🎰🔥

//

#*NFT Farming 👨‍🌾🖼*

Stake tokens, earn NFTs, easy enough right?! NFTs are so hot right now and with the potential of this project, earning some of these early rare NFTs could be one of the most profitable things you’ve ever done in a few years time.

**TL;DR: more demand, super cool limited edition artwork by the very talented in-house artist** 🎨

//

#*End of September - Initial Woof Offerings (Launchpad) 🐶🚀*

The launchpad is scheduled to be released at the end of September for both chains. We have had 2 weekly teasers for how this will look in practice. So far we have been shown that there will be guaranteed allocation tiers for loyal puppers and a mechanism to earn interest on tokens locked for the Launchpad. 

Launchpads have shown to be a very valuable asset for DEXs and tend to result in greatly increased demand for the native tokens (in this case, WOOF and KWOOF).

1st teaser here: https://twitter.com/shibance/status/1428705675228573708?s=21

2nd teaser here: https://twitter.com/shibance/status/1431258906743902211?s=21

**TL;DR: Groundfloor access to the hottest new meme projects. Locking mechanism to reduce effective circulating supply** 🔒

//

#**The Economic Moat of Shibance 💪**

Also sometimes known as the unique selling point (USP), the economic moat for Shibance is the first mover advantage of servicing the huge and fast-growing demand for meme projects in the DEX space. 

The addressable market here is absolutely massive and it’s growing at a frankly ridiculous rate.

To get some idea if you’re in the dark here, have a look at this article on TVL growth in the DeFi market: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2021/05/20/after-growing-88x-in-a-year-where-does-defi-go-from-here/amp/

And unless you live under a rock, I’m not sure you need to be informed about the size of the meme market. Just look at Doge coin, Shiba Inu and Safemoon. A lot of people got very rich very fast on these and many many others, this could be your chance to do the same. Finding the next Doge is hard but getting exposure to the whole meme market is now easy!

The team aren’t looking to be a Pancakeswap or a Curve. They’re looking to be a ‘Shibance’ - there are no direct competitors for what they’re trying to do. The team have been nothing but impressive and very competent so far, evidenced by what they have achieved since launch already. Great idea, great team and great potential for massive gains!

**TL;DR: DeFi to the moon, memes to the moon, Shibance to the moon!** 🌝

#**Summary of the the Shibance Ecosystem**

Shibance aims to build an entire ecosystem dedicated to meme tokens. Ticker symbols: WOOF for BSC and KWOOF for KCC.  

*Launch Features:*  
* 		DEX platform  
* 		Farming rewards for partner projects  
* 		WOOF staking pool  

*Post Launch (Lotteries and NFT Farming very soon):*
* 		Initial WOOF/KWOOF offerings (‘IWOs’), on our launchpad  
* 		WOOF/KWOOF lotteries  
* 		Weekly votes on farming boosts for meme tokens  
* 		Top-secret development update (project codename: FLOOF)  
* 		NFT farming  
* 		Cross-chain support  

The UI/UX is amazing and very user friendly - if you’ve ever used a dex before you’ll have no issues with Shibance. Even if not, the Docs section on the DApp and the Medium articles contain all the information you need to get started. Plus, you can always pop in the TG chat where there is always someone willing to help with whatever you need.   

Shibance already have a very respectful collection of farms and staking options given its been less than 2 months. I won’t mention them for fear of the automod but check out the pairs you can farm currently - It’s got some of the hottest meme coins right now and the team is always working hard to add more!  

Staking is done in the “DoggyPound”, so you can earn extra tokens without the risk of IL! Shibance have already partnered a few of the bigger meme projects to launch this year! You can currently earn a few different and very popular tokens in the DoggyPound too! Expect more of this to come in the future.  

**Check the official Twitter for the latest or join the telegram and check the pins. Links included at the end of the post.**

What’s the best part about all of this? With a huge addressable market and great core team, oftentimes when you find a project this good, it’s already 100x’d and you don’t know if it’s worth jumping in still.  

This time however, you’re not late! Mcap is criminally low for both tokens and the APR/APY is still very *very* good. I’m not saying it’ll moon tomorrow or the next day but DYOR and a lot of you will see the potential this one has got. Speak to anyone in the chat and you’ll start to understand why we’re so bullish on this.  

The smart contracts for both chains have been audited already by ApeAudits. Links to medium articles regarding the audits (the audit report can be found here):

WOOF: https://shibance.medium.com/initial-audit-release-fe55c6c998c2

KWOOF: https://shibance.medium.com/shibance-kcc-completes-first-official-audit-158a65406c2c

The team are very professional and proficient at what they do. In the telegram you’ll also find a strong community of holders and as mentioned before, we’re always happy to help.  

*Why should you trust what I have to say?*  

First of all, I’m not a shill. Look at my history, I’ve been active on Reddit for a while and often contribute to finance, econ and crypto themed subs. My recency bias and arrogance tells me I can also pick a winner pretty well, I had two projects recently each turn less than $50 into over 8k (one of which has two active farming pairs and a staking option on Shibance and rhymes with DumPocket 😉). I then held through the subsequent fall from ATH, so I’m not an oracle and none of this is financial advice. I don’t have a crystal ball, but I know a growing market and a great dev team when I see it. The whole DEX (and wider DeFi) sector is growing very fast. This industry is unstoppable at the moment and the same can definitely be said about meme projects.

**This could truly be your last chance to get an entry price at this level!** Put your straw hat on and get out in them fields where there’s seeds to sow, crops to grow and great yields to show! 👨‍🌾

Speak to anyone in the chat and you’ll start to understand why we’re so bullish on this.  

The smart contracts for both chains have been audited already by ApeAudits. Links to medium articles regarding the audits (the audit report can be found here):

The team are very professional and proficient at what they do. In the telegram you’ll also find a strong community of holders and as mentioned before, we’re always happy to help.  

*Why should you trust what I have to say?*  

First of all, I’m not a shill. Look at my history, I’ve been active on Reddit for a while and often contribute to finance, econ and crypto themed subs. My recency bias and arrogance tells me I can also pick a winner pretty well, I had two projects recently each turn less than $50 into over 8k (one of which has two active farming pairs and a staking option on Shibance and rhymes with DumPocket 😉). I then held through the subsequent fall from ATH, so I’m not an oracle and none of this is financial advice. I don’t have a crystal ball, but I know a growing market and a great dev team when I see it. The whole DEX (and wider DeFi) sector is growing very fast. This industry is unstoppable at the moment and the same can definitely be said about meme projects.

Shibance | Multi-chain meme dex on BSC and KCC.

‼️Lotteries and NFT farming coming very soon, IWOs (launchpad) not too long after that. Super secret game-changer code name: Project FLOOF in the works ‼️

To celebrate the launch of this much anticipated feature, the **initial funding for the Lottery is 800,000 in WOOF tokens!** This doesn’t include the extra tokens added from purchase of tickets so the prize pools are really nothing to be sniffed at!

Official Twitter announcement: https://twitter.com/shibance/status/1432014234053840900?s=21

*In this article I will explain why I think this could be your last chance to ever get Shibance tokens at this price again* 📈

I’ve done a lot of the DD leg work for you to save you some time but make sure to check it all out for yourself 🕵️‍♂️

**For the degenerates among you, yes you, I’ve added a TL;DR for each section to help you understand in a quick skim** 🦍⏩ 

#*Right around the corner for Shibance 🔜*

The lottery and NFT farming utilities are very close to being launched now. They will be launching on BSC first and half a month later will be added to the KCC network DEX as well. This coincides with the 2nd halvings for both chains, after which the halvings are yearly. 

If you don’t know why halvings can be such a positive event I’d suggest you have a look at BTC price action post-halving or any of the other numerous examples.

**TL;DR : more demand, less new tokens added to supply** 📈

//

#*First up - Lottery 🎰*

Launching on the 30th - the lottery prize pool is initially funded with a whopping 800,000 in WOOF tokens!! This comes to around $20,000 at the current price (but in a year that amount could make anyone very very happy). The lottery system looks amazing and with the chance to win so many tokens you could leapfrog a whole load of long term investors with just one win! I know where some of my staking rewards are going!

Prize tiers that haven’t been won will be rolled over into the next lottery to keep that jackpot going!

**Oh, and it burns!!** 20% of the funds for the lottery pools will be allocated for burns - introducing another deflationary mechanism to the tokenomic structure of Shibance. Even if you’re not the lottery type, who doesn’t like stuff that makes each of your tokens more valuable!

**TL;DR: Chance to win big, inbuilt deflationary element to control supply and make your tokens more valuable** 🎰🔥

//

#*NFT Farming 👨‍🌾🖼*

Stake tokens, earn NFTs, easy enough right?! NFTs are so hot right now and with the potential of this project, earning some of these early rare NFTs could be one of the most profitable things you’ve ever done in a few years time.

**TL;DR: more demand, super cool limited edition artwork by the very talented in-house artist** 🎨

//

#*End of September - Initial Woof Offerings (Launchpad) 🐶🚀*

The launchpad is scheduled to be released at the end of September for both chains. We have had 2 weekly teasers for how this will look in practice. So far we have been shown that there will be guaranteed allocation tiers for loyal puppers and a mechanism to earn interest on tokens locked for the Launchpad. 

Launchpads have shown to be a very valuable asset for DEXs and tend to result in greatly increased demand for the native tokens (in this case, WOOF and KWOOF).

1st teaser here: https://twitter.com/shibance/status/1428705675228573708?s=21

2nd teaser here: https://twitter.com/shibance/status/1431258906743902211?s=21

**TL;DR: Groundfloor access to the hottest new meme projects. Locking mechanism to reduce effective circulating supply** 🔒

//

#**The Economic Moat of Shibance 💪**

Also sometimes known as the unique selling point (USP), the economic moat for Shibance is the first mover advantage of servicing the huge and fast-growing demand for meme projects in the DEX space. 

The addressable market here is absolutely massive and it’s growing at a frankly ridiculous rate.

To get some idea if you’re in the dark here, have a look at this article on TVL growth in the DeFi market: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2021/05/20/after-growing-88x-in-a-year-where-does-defi-go-from-here/amp/

And unless you live under a rock, I’m not sure you need to be informed about the size of the meme market. Just look at Doge coin, Shiba Inu and Safemoon. A lot of people got very rich very fast on these and many many others, this could be your chance to do the same. Finding the next Doge is hard but getting exposure to the whole meme market is now easy!

The team aren’t looking to be a Pancakeswap or a Curve. They’re looking to be a ‘Shibance’ - there are no direct competitors for what they’re trying to do. The team have been nothing but impressive and very competent so far, evidenced by what they have achieved since launch already. Great idea, great team and great potential for massive gains!

**TL;DR: DeFi to the moon, memes to the moon, Shibance to the moon!** 🌝

#**Summary of the the Shibance Ecosystem**

Shibance aims to build an entire ecosystem dedicated to meme tokens. Ticker symbols: WOOF for BSC and KWOOF for KCC.  

*Launch Features:*  
* 		DEX platform  
* 		Farming rewards for partner projects  
* 		WOOF staking pool  

*Post Launch (Lotteries and NFT Farming very soon):*
* 		Initial WOOF/KWOOF offerings (‘IWOs’), on our launchpad  
* 		WOOF/KWOOF lotteries  
* 		Weekly votes on farming boosts for meme tokens  
* 		Top-secret development update (project codename: FLOOF)  
* 		NFT farming  
* 		Cross-chain support  

The UI/UX is amazing and very user friendly - if you’ve ever used a dex before you’ll have no issues with Shibance. Even if not, the Docs section on the DApp and the Medium articles contain all the information you need to get started. Plus, you can always pop in the TG chat where there is always someone willing to help with whatever you need.   

Shibance already have a very respectful collection of farms and staking options given its been less than 2 months. I won’t mention them for fear of the automod but check out the pairs you can farm currently - It’s got some of the hottest meme coins right now and the team is always working hard to add more!  

Staking is done in the “DoggyPound”, so you can earn extra tokens without the risk of IL! Shibance have already partnered a few of the bigger meme projects to launch this year! You can currently earn a few different and very popular tokens in the DoggyPound too! Expect more of this to come in the future.  

**Check the official Twitter for the latest or join the telegram and check the pins. Links included at the end of the post.**

What’s the best part about all of this? With a huge addressable market and great core team, oftentimes when you find a project this good, it’s already 100x’d and you don’t know if it’s worth jumping in still.  

This time however, you’re not late! Mcap is criminally low for both tokens and the APR/APY is still very *very* good.

* 		Top-secret development update (project codename: FLOOF)  
* 		NFT farming  
* 		Cross-chain support  

The UI/UX is amazing and very user friendly - if you’ve ever used a dex before you’ll have no issues with Shibance. Even if not, the Docs section on the DApp and the Medium articles contain all the information you need to get started. Plus, you can always pop in the TG chat where there is always someone willing to help with whatever you need.   

Shibance already have a very respectful collection of farms and staking options given its been less than 2 months. I won’t mention them for fear of the automod but check out the pairs you can farm currently - It’s got some of the hottest meme coins right now and the team is always working hard to add more!  

Staking is done in the “DoggyPound”, so you can earn extra tokens without the risk of IL! Shibance have already partnered a few of the bigger meme projects to launch this year! You can currently earn a few different and very popular tokens in the DoggyPound too! Expect more of this to come in the future.  

**Check the official Twitter for the latest or join the telegram and check the pins. Links included at the end of the post.**

What’s the best part about all of this? With a huge addressable market and great core team, oftentimes when you find a project this good, it’s already 100x’d and you don’t know if it’s worth jumping in still.  

This time however, you’re not late! Mcap is criminally low for both tokens and the APR/APY is still very *very* good. I’m not saying it’ll moon tomorrow or the next day but DYOR and a lot of you will see the potential this one has got. Speak to anyone in the chat and you’ll start to understand why we’re so bullish on this.  

The smart contracts for both chains have been audited already by ApeAudits. Links to medium articles regarding the audits (the audit report can be found here):

WOOF: https://shibance.medium.com/initial-audit-release-fe55c6c998c2

KWOOF: https://shibance.medium.com/shibance-kcc-completes-first-official-audit-158a65406c2c

The team are very professional and proficient at what they do. In the telegram you’ll also find a strong community of holders and as mentioned before, we’re always happy to help.  

*Why should you trust what I have to say?*  

First of all, I’m not a shill. Look at my history, I’ve been active on Reddit for a while and often contribute to finance, econ and crypto themed subs. My recency bias and arrogance tells me I can also pick a winner pretty well, I had two projects recently each turn less than $50 into over 8k (one of which has two active farming pairs and a staking option on Shibance and rhymes with DumPocket 😉). I then held through the subsequent fall from ATH, so I’m not an oracle and none of this is financial advice. I don’t have a crystal ball, but I know a growing market and a great dev team when I see it. The whole DEX (and wider DeFi) sector is growing very fast. This industry is unstoppable at the moment and the same can definitely be said about meme projects.

**This could truly be your last chance to get an entry price at this level!** Put your straw hat on and get out in them fields where there’s seeds to sow, crops to grow and great yields to show! 👨‍🌾

How to Create an Aggregator Website (No-code Tools and Examples),https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Octoparseideas/comments/peah3z/how_to_create_an_aggregator_website_nocode_tools/,Octoparseideas,1,2021-08-30 11:56:57,0,/r/u_Octoparseideas/comments/peah3z/how_to_create_an_aggregator_website_nocode_tools/,NaN,"[https://www.octoparse.com/blog/how-to-create-an-aggregator-website/?re=](https://www.octoparse.com/blog/how-to-create-an-aggregator-website/?re=)

This article gives an overall introduction to aggregator websites — what it is, how it makes money, how to gather web data to build one, and the top aggregator website examples existing on the Internet. If you are building your website or looking for ideas to start a side hustle, stay with me. You may find new ideas spring to your mind.

# What’s An Aggregator Website

Building a website might be an intimidating job for a newbie. If this is what you are worried about, well it shall not now.

No-code tools have made many things understandable and easy to act on. Stay with me and you will find that building an aggregator website is easier than you expect.

However, what’s [an aggregator website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregator) and why bother to make one?

An aggregator website brings relevant data from different sources to one place. It serves as a hub where the audience can get up-to-date information and compare without traveling across a load of pages.

If you build it well, it could be a great stepping stone for a startup business.

Aggregators like Indeed and Skyscanner are big names. That doesn’t mean small sites are ruled out. Many niche sites are doing fairly well. We will discuss types of aggregator websites and promising niches later.

# Build An Aggregator Website for Real Needs

You may wanna ask how much money we can make from this. Or else, what pushes one to build such a website from scratch?

Yep, that’s essential and we’ll see how to monetize later. First thing first, you must have a reason to start a business.

One of the Octoparse users has told me a great story. He is a full-time worker in pharmaceuticals and a board game lover as well. Fellow players in the community moaned about the lack of a platform to compare local board games’ prices and he decided to build one from scratch.

Yea, he knows nothing about coding. And he did it.

He built a local price comparison website for board game players in Australia. That’s where he started his journey with [Octoparse](https://www.octoparse.com/). And over 3 years, he gained great experiences both in web scraping and website maintenance and made money through an affiliation partnership with Amazon.

Opportunities come from people’s needs in real life.

If you spot any gap in needs and people are desperate for a solution, congrats! This could be a starting point for your business. If nothing comes to your mind now, you may get inspired by the Best Examples.

Once you got your website idea and figure out where to get your data, you need an efficient way to extract data and upload it to your website.

# Gather Data for your Website with a No-code Tool

[Data collection](https://www.octoparse.com/blog?blogCategory=Data%20Collection) is an essential part of an aggregator website. Rich, clean data that updates regularly guarantee the usability of your site.

How to gather web data easily without coding?

That’s where Octoparse comes to help. Put it simply, it is a web scraping software that helps you build a data scraper within clicks. You tell the bot what data you want, and it runs for you.

**Pros**

* Easy-to-use: get web data without coding; our [tech support](https://www.octoparse.com/blog/octoparse-customer-support) has you covered
* Scalable: scrape large data from hundreds of websites
* Organized: data can be cleaned and organized into spreadsheets; API service is available for building your data pipeline

**Cons**

* Learning curve required

Octoparse is a no-code tool. It can handle many complicated situations such as anti-scraping, log-in wall, AJAX, infinite scrolls, etc and these features are integrated into an intuitive UI.

Hence, it still requires a learning curve for a new beginner to get familiar with the software. A programmer can pick it up in a few days. A non-coder can take 1–2 weeks or so. The good news is you got [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCweDWm1QY2G67SDAKX7nreg/featured) videos, [tutorials](https://helpcenter.octoparse.com/hc/en-us) to utilize, and [support](https://helpcenter.octoparse.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to resort to.

[Website Builder](https://websitesetup.org/web-design-software/)

[Web Hosting Provider](https://websitesetup.org/best-web-hosting-sites/)

Now you have figured out how to build a data pipeline, the next question is, how to make money with the data/the aggregator website?

# How Do Aggregator Websites Make Money

What’s the aggregator business model?

The essence of the website is to act as a two-sided market — *“where buyers and sellers interact through an intermediary to fulfill each other’s needs”* (explained by Tanya in [Two-sided Marketplace](https://www.feedough.com/two-sided-marketplace-what-is-it-how-it-operates/)).

Based on the values you offer to the two sides, you may monetize through ways below:

## Affiliate Partnership

When you gain a group of audience, brands may come to you for affiliation partnership and in return, offer you commission for each deal made through your website.

The profits depend on what product or services you are promoting. Take Octoparse, a Saas web scraping tool, as an example, you can make $10 — $300 for each new deal. The number would be smaller for commodities, while it is easier to converse audience to the buyer.

[Commission from an Affiliate Program](https://preview.redd.it/qwtvpsoj4fk71.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08634b73af38c2da04c4b51f1af83224eff4f421)

Instead of waiting passively, you can join affiliate networks to find more lucrative partnerships. Affiliate networks give merchants access to a group of affiliates. Vice versa, they also offer opportunities for affiliates to reach more brands.

There is more to dig into [affiliate marketing](https://www.accelerationpartners.com/resources/guides/affiliate-marketing-101/).

## Featured Content Service

Google Ad on the search results page is a vivid example.

[Google Search Results Page](https://preview.redd.it/h5y8bb5o4fk71.png?width=568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c747141162f63be129fa92178652a5066d0a1dc)

Featured content service works just like Google ads. It gives better exposure to the goods or services by an eye-catching design or a better ranking, etc.

Since you are the website owner, you are the people in charge of how to showcase the products. Offering special tags or layouts can help differentiate the product from others and draw more attention.

[Amazon listings](https://preview.redd.it/vblxzwjq4fk71.png?width=503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bf8c1b1e116d862b54c5d852bcdadce306e8f36)

Well, I am not sure if the Best-seller Tag of Amazon is a paid service — I believe not. While it is an example.

## Display Advertisement

If you know anything about [Google Adsense](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6242051?hl=en), you may know how a website owner can make money by placing advertisements on his/her website. As you set aside the space for display, Google Adsense will match the ads that are targeted to your audience and this saves your efforts of searching for the right advertisers.

As your audience grows, a business that shares the same group of the audience will reach you. And the page “Advertise with us” will find its place on your website.

## Subscription Membership

This is rather obvious. If you are gathering valuable information and presenting it to them in the best way that conveniences your audience, they would love to pay. Sometimes rummaging through the Internet for a piece of helpful information is tiring.

Of course, you can set a standard to differentiate what services or information you are giving to your sponsors, and what is offered free to the public.

## Community

The client I mentioned above, who built a board game price comparison website, won over a large audience from a public FB group. What’s more, he built his own FB page and community as well.

That is because he was scraping prices from numerous board game stores with Octoparse and he knew which product was on sale and he shared the best deal of the day on his FB page and community.

That’s how he offers value to his audience. This is only one small piece I could share. Extend your influence beyond the website to more social media platforms, more paths will be paved for the monetization process.

# Aggregator Websites Best Examples

You may wonder what kind of aggregator website you shall build. Let’s look at some typical types of aggregator websites.

## Coupon/deal Aggregation

[Groupon](https://www.groupon.com/): The website curates time-limited coupons for online and offline purchases, covering a wide range of products and services.

[LivingSocial](https://www.livingsocial.com/): Livingsocial focuses on deals in the Beauty and Food sector.

\&gt; More [News Aggregators Examples](https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-news-aggregator-websites-how-to-build-your-own/) by WPBeginner.

[Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/): The website started from a fares aggregator and now is becoming a one-stop shop for everything you need for travel.

## Jobs Aggregator

The concept of a job aggregator is self-evident to us. There are job board giants familiar to us, like Indeed, Glassdoor, and LinkedIn.

When I researched this topic, I came across an article — [*how job aggregators are sabotaging online recruiting*](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/job-aggregators-sabotaging-online-recruiting-tips-how-victor-assad/). And I realize that an aggregator is not welcomed by all.

It makes sense when the owner is not operating it in a moral way. While the wrong is not about being an aggregator website, but how you serve the two sides. In this case, a job aggregator shall help connect recruiters and the candidates, in the meantime, protect the privacy of both from misuse.

## Potential Niche — Remote Jobs

Undeniably, working from home has been an irreversible trend. The covid pandemic in 2020 could be a strong impetus. And how industries and employees benefit from this flexibility offer real values to the business world.

&gt;*“Two years ago remote would not have made the top 50 list, so it’s an enormous change. This is really the biggest shift in how we work since the invention of the automobile.”*  
*— — Ladders CEO Marc Cenedella*

The momentum for remote jobs will last if not grow further and a good niche shall have much room to dig into.

# Conclusions

And I felt empowered when I knew a non-coder can build such a great website from scratch with Octoparse. He is satisfied with the support and content with the experience.

Cryptocurrency's MOON token is built on the Arbitrum network. With the Arbitrum network public mainnet launch, we could possibly see easy to access liquidity pools for MOONs.

&amp;#x200B;

Arbitrum is an Ethereum scaling solution based on the Optimistic rollup protocol.

&amp;#x200B;

It will facilitate low-cost smart contracts with high throughput while leveraging the security and decentralized features of Ethereum.

Is this real? and should we hope for some juice ?

DeFi Growth Metrics Soars as TVL Tops $82B,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltStreetBets/comments/pegf3i/defi_growth_metrics_soars_as_tvl_tops_82b/,PatriciaHarris_,1,2021-08-30 19:44:04,7,/r/AltStreetBets/comments/pegf3i/defi_growth_metrics_soars_as_tvl_tops_82b/,Discussion,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has seen explosive growth this year. Many DeFi tokens have already soared to their all-time highs and are looking strong to hit higher highs. According to data aggregator Defi Pulse, the Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi has topped $82 billion and AAVE comes across as the leading project with 15.78% dominance and $14.98 billion in TVL. 

Some of the factors that created a bullish case for DeFi tokens and projects includes rising total value locked, increased trading volume on decentralized exchanges, and growing users in the DeFi ecosystem.

**Total Value Locked Touches All-time High**

The data from DeFi Pulse highlights that the total value locked across all DeFi protocol is just a few billions away from hitting its All-Time High of $87 billion. The top 5 projects with the utmost contributions to the broader DeFi ecosystem include are Aave (AAVE) with $14.98 billion, InstaDApp (INST) with $11.47 billion, Curve Finance (CRV) with $11.07 billion, Compound (COMP) with $10.07 billion and Maker (MKR) with $8.72 billion. 

All these projects when combined, give a total of $56 billion dollars which is about 65% of the total value locked. Analysts speculate TVL to be one of the best metrics to analyse DeFi ecosystem sentiment and growth.

**Increased Trading Volume On Decentralized Exchanges** 

Another sign which denotes that the DeFi sector is booming is the soaring day-to-day trading volume on decentralized exchanges (DEX), led by Uniswap, whose volume has steadily increased, per Dune Analytics. 

Besides this, Lucas Outumuro, head researcher at Into The Block revealed that decentralized exchange Uniswap became the very first DeFi protocol to cultivate more than $1 billion worth of platform fees for liquidity providers in August 2021.

**Growing New Users In DeFi Ecosystem** 

The third indication that DeFi tokens and projects will skyrocket is the continuously growing number of users entering the DeFi space. Data from Dune Analytics reveals that the number of new users as calculated by unique addresses interacting with DeFi protocols has significantly surged and now stands at a record high of 3 million. 

The growth of DeFi space has seen a meteoric surge this year. The TVL, which stood at $13.69 billion in November 2020, swung up to $20 billion in December 2020 and stands at $82 billion today. Matthew Roszak, a veteran cryptocurrency investor and co-founder of DeFi platform Vesper believes the DeFi industry is poised to explode 10-fold. In an interview with Market Insider he noted that DeFi space TVL will hit $800 billion in the year 2022.

**Here are some Top DeFi projects to go live in 2021**

 **1.SyncBond**

SyncBond is a project taking in crypto funds and issuing crypto-based bonds. The SYNC token, which is being currently released in a year-long process, will be one of the main tools to generate passive income. Unlike usual yield farming projects, the SYNC token will not be locked directly within liquidity provider pools. Instead, SyncBond has chosen to create a crypto bond. 

 **2. UniFarmer**

UniFarmer is another one of the up-and-coming yield farming projects. It is still in the token sale stage, arriving months after some of the hottest yield farming projects of 2020. 

 **3. Pledge:**

Pledge aims to be the crypto-asset lending platform for all. Unlike most available lending protocols, they aren't focused on crypto traders borrowing digital assets in real-time for day trading. Instead, Pledge answers the need for longer-term financing, mainly serving crypto-asset holders to diversify their portfolio with non-crypto assets, e.g. real estate, without the friction of portfolio. Backed by the best from Stanford University, this is one of the most anticipated projects on the BSC.

 **4. Venus Protocol**

Venus Protocol is another relatively new decentralized finance project. Its distinguishing feature is that it is based on Binance Chain, avoiding the congestion and fees of the Ethereum network. 

Venus Protocol moves away from direct yield farming but serves as one of the underlying sources of funds, which can then move into yield farming. The protocol relies mostly on dollar-pegged stable coins, where arbitrage rarely leads to big price swings and big potential losses or liquidations. "

Just how early are we in the cryptospace?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pek6ms/just_how_early_are_we_in_the_cryptospace/,MrNoOneYet,1,2021-08-30 23:19:34,211,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pek6ms/just_how_early_are_we_in_the_cryptospace/,FINANCE,"Well. Yesterday I was thinking about crypto. Sorry, I lied. Five minutes ago I was thinking about crypto... And what I was thinking about was just how early we are right now. I like to think of it in terms of the Technology adoption life cycle, or the Rogers' Bell Curve. Here, we (the people of r/cc) surely end up on what is knows as an Innovator or an Early Adopter.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Technology Adoption Life Cycle](https://preview.redd.it/9wpzhyb7iik71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45818393295e45d70438fb033d2589d1772ed173)

So far so good. I think we all know this. But let me tell you something else. I recently graduated from a well-reputed business school, where I've had several finance courses. None of them took cryptocurrency seriously. None.

Every time we heard about investing, it was ALWAYS the same old stocks and bonds, stock and bonds, stocks and bonds. Crypto is simply not seen as a way to either hedge your portfolio or optimize your gains. Not yet at least. And while yes, it is changing at the moment, and some already adopted it into their courses, Universities, that are know for their subject discovery are currently moving into the space. So keep holding, we are in it for the big %%%!"
