PSA: You earn Compound tokens when you supply AND borrow on Compound,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/lwy0db/psa_you_earn_compound_tokens_when_you_supply_and/,leakyvalve,18,2021-03-04 00:32:14,58,/r/Compound/comments/lwy0db/psa_you_earn_compound_tokens_when_you_supply_and/,NaN,"Just wanted to bring awareness to this topic because IMO this is Compound's biggest value and I feel like not many people know about it.

Let's say I supply Compound with $5,000 USDC and the APY for USDC is 5% and Compound distribution APY is 4%. That means I earn 5% APY for USDC and 4% in Compound for supplying.

I then look to the borrow assets column to borrow USDC.  The APY to borrow USDC is 6% and Compound distribution is 5% APY.  This means that I can borrow USDC at a 6% interest rate and EARN 5% in Compound for borrowing.

If I completely ignore the interest I am earning for supplying USDC, the loan to borrow USDC is really only 1% because I am earning 5% in Compound for borrowing.

If I do not ignore the interest I am earning for supplying USDC, I am getting paid to borrow USDC.

Leave a comment below if you were completely unaware of this concept as I was a month ago."
Is cDai/Dai rate ever-increasing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/lxiclt/is_cdaidai_rate_everincreasing/,Virtual_Ad_3722,2,2021-03-04 19:23:35,9,/r/Compound/comments/lxiclt/is_cdaidai_rate_everincreasing/,NaN,"This is a dumb question and perhaps is asked many times. As title suggests, I thought the exchange rate should be ever-increasing, otherwise it doesn't make sense that for example, I deposit 10 DAI with rate 0.02, but redeem later with rate 0.019 which amounts to less than 10 DAI that I initially deposited.

However, when looking at [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/compound-dai](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/compound-dai), we can see the price of cDAI is fluctuating, so the above scenario is possible? How to interpret the price chart here? I know DAI fluctuates in USD, so perhaps a cDAI-in-DAI chart will show correctly the non-decreasing price? Or I misinterpret the mechanism of cDAI?

Another example is interest-bearing ETH from Alpha. I thought ibETH value in ETH would be non-decreasing so ibETH holders can redeem increased amount of ETH over time at any moment. However, the chart [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/interest-bearing-eth](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/interest-bearing-eth) suggests again the fluctuation.

Where in the compound smart contracts can I see this logic. I‚Äôm confused about how to do this in a way that doesn‚Äôt involve pushing a transaction every single block which obviously seems wrong and not how it works. I see how cTokens accrue their interest every block (without needing to constantly push state updates each block) but I don‚Äôt quite see how this works for COMP. 

Naively if we just notate the block height at which a user e.g. deposited collateral and starts earning COMP rewards, then at the time of COMP withdrawal we miscalculate the amount of COMP owed to the user if we only use her proportion of the pool *at withdrawal time* since it may have been way more of that pool for most of the blocks COMP was accruing and then a massive whale came into the pool only the last few blocks. So how do we keep track correctly or what am I missing here. I read solidity so if you can point me to the relevant code in the compound-protocol codebase I could probably work it out from there"

Compound is the #13 seed in the Bitcoin bracket. Its opponent is #4 THETA. This is Compound's first appearance in the UCT.

Those familiar with March Madness, or remember this from last year, will get it right away. Starting tonight at midnight, on Twitter @ UltimateCrypto7, there will be a poll for each game, open to all. The coin with more votes after 3 days will be declared the winner and move on. 

Like last year, the Ultimate Crypto Tournament pits the top 64 coins (by market cap) in a single elimination tournament. Crypto is a collaborative, cooperative space with room for all, but we can still have some fun.

So, vote early, tell your friends, and may the best coin win! The games begin at midnight tonight and run until 11:59 pm PT March 18.

I was looking at the markets and the ether borrow market has a negative net rate (-2.42).  Its the difference between the borrow apy and the comp apy.

3. Since I connected the ETH wallet, I was expecting to see my Stablecoins show up on compound too, since they roll into the same ETH wallet on Ledger, is my expectation mistaken?
