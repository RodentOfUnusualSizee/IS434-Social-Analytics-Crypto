We think being part of Compound would be a valuable addition to the protocol and a great next step for the GUSD.

[GUSD](https://www.gemini.com/dollar) can always be created and redeemed with USD 1:1 on Gemini. As one of the most popular exchanges and fiat on-ramps, we think our users would find Compound’s interest rate markets attractive and bring further growth to the protocol. We also believe Compound and the general DeFi ecosystem can benefit from diversifying exposure to different centralized stablecoins by including trusted, highly regulated issuers like Gemini.

In addition, we are increasingly exploring strategies that can augment Gemini’s value-add to DeFi and support for the ecosystem. These include thinking about possible product integrations and having active relationships with regulators to figure out the friction points and possible solutions that can help us best collaborate with teams like Compound Labs. GUSD could act as a natural gateway asset for these future plans and facilitate possible integrations and support for Compound.

**Proposal**

We propose including a GUSD market with an initial collateral factor of 0% to start with.

Later on, we’d love to have conversations with the Compound community about increasing the collateral factor and adding COMP distribution for the market.

So, what instruments should we consider?

\#1: Lending

Lending is perhaps the most recognized DeFi activity in the space, mainly because many of the early DeFi platforms like [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/) specialized in lending protocols. It’s a straightforward concept: you lend your digital assets to a platform by locking your assets into a smart contract. This works for me well, and there is no reason to avoid this approach. 

\#2: Staking

As the term implies, staking involves the process of locking in digital assets into a smart contract. Many DeFi platforms also use “staking” as a means to open what is essentially a savings account on the blockchain. Like a savings account, your balance will accrue additional income, typically in the form of the same type of tokens or another token on the same blockchain. In other words, you deposit an asset, and someone uses it, paying you the interest rates based on demand. Examples: [AAVE](https://aave.com/), [Compound](https://compound.finance/), [AlphaHomora](https://homora.alphafinance.io/alpha).

\#3: Yield farming

This one is perhaps my favorite method for DeFi. Yield farming is a newer concept than staking, though the two share many similarities. While staking can refer to actions such as locking up 32 ETH to become a validator node on the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 network, yield farming refers more exclusively to providing liquidity to a DeFi protocol in return for yield. Your liquidity is being used for AMM, paying you the fees when traders exchange one of the tokens you deposited. Examples: [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Curve](https://curve.fi/), [Pancakeswap](https://pancakeswap.finance/).

At the same time, some platforms use a combination of some of these methods, due to which a high interest rate and simplified investment process are achieved. It can be good for early investors. Example: [Midas Yield](https://y.midas.investments/).

If you, like me, are delighted with passive earnings with DeFi, please share your experience and thoughts. What platforms have you already used?"

I’m in my mid thirties, and I have struggled with debt my whole adult life, I’m still paying for mistakes I made in my 20’s and to make matters worse - I still struggle with CC debt. I’m off the payday loans highway robbery game thank God, but I live pretty close to paycheck-to-paycheck and have my own apartment, in my name, for the first time in about 10 years. The CC debt is part of how I “afford” to live - or more accurately a part of my liquidity strategy to pay my bills - or at least it was until today.

Since learning about Compound, and thinking it was just the best damn idea I’d ever heard, I have been staking whatever I could afford until I finally reached enough staked to borrow the exact amount of my credit card debt, and stay below 60% lent. Well I finally fucking did it and as a grown ass man I don’t tear up easy, but this struggle with constant debt and uncertainty has really been a weight on me these past few years and I can’t help but shed a few as I close these fucking credit accounts forever.

Today own my own debt, today I pay the rate I chose and not one that was chosen by my shitty credit score, today I am finally free of the mistakes of my youth that set me on such a difficult path - and I owe it in it’s entirety to the Compound team, and to the DeFi world in general - without their effort and brilliance I don’t know how I would have ever climbed out of this hole and I just want to say thank you, and that to anyone else in a similar situation you can do the exact same thing - you can take your life back and be your own lending house - your own investment firm - and your own person - thank you all so much, good luck to everyone, and God bless"

I spent on average maximum 5min per day on this page and was watching Netflix with it.

Here is my full proof of all my earnings and payouts: [https://imgur.com/a/WvRhNBV](https://imgur.com/a/WvRhNBV)  
Most earnings are in BTC (over $200). There are plenty of other coins to earn too but BTC brings the best ratio.  
Link: [https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=SLimon)

DutchyCorp let's you do tasks and surveys where you get awarded Dutchy Coins. With these coins you are able to let a Faucet running and you can get paid in about 50 coins. Payouts to your Coinbase Account are without fees.  
How are you able to earn so much on DutchyCorp:  
\- Do the Coin Rolls and Dutchy Rolls for daily Bonus  
\- Run the Autofaucet on weekend with 20% claim Bonus  
\- Do Surveys on Offerwall to be able to earn more DUTCHY and increase your own level  
\- be active to get some free Coins by the RainBot  
\- Go to the Shortwall and click on the pages on a daily base  
\- Run the AutoFaucet with Balance Mode for additional 10%

I did my payouts directly to Coinbase. Payouts are really fast and after about ten seconds you get confirmation of your withdrawal. If you are new to Coinbase, you can get an additional $10 of Bitcoin after you have bought Bitcoin worth $100 with this link: [https://www.coinbase.com/join/lussy\_u](https://www.coinbase.com/join/lussy_u)"

I already bought a couple of tokens and supplied some to the platform to earn interest and test it out. I love how well it works. Here are my questions:

1) How does the COMP token derive value? What mechanism, aside from people buying it for speculation, makes it increase in value? Do tokens get burned? Locked up?

2) What are Compounds direct competitors? Are there any coming down the road?

3) Will they be able to add other token and asset pools over time? How about asset pools that are not ETH/ERC token related?

Thanks in advance my friends."

I just want to get round the security/risk before lending what I think its a decent amount (I want to let it grow for several years, hopefully that ll neglect the gas fees lol)

From what I understand , losing my funds to borrowers not paying back is not a possibility

I believe it all comes to how safe the smart contracts are? Is there any other risk factor Im missing?
