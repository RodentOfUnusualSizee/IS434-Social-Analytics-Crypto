* FL buybacks and burn for USDFL earned

Currently, loans in Freeliquid Borrow are not charged with any interest rate (also called “Stability Fees”). At first look, it is beneficial to borrowers — their loans do not cost anything. However, it might incentivize users to hold USDFL loans for very long periods of time, preventing the return of USDFL back and thus affecting its price.

Adding an interest rate as additional USDFL for covering the debt will partially solve this issue and will also generate a revenue stream for the Protocol. The funds received can be spent on FL buybacks and subsequent burn, which will give FL utility as an earning token.

Please note that the Stability Fees can be introduced only through voting and will be discussed with the Freeliquid community beforehand.

**Introducing USDFL stabilization mechanism**

* Ensuring USDFL peg at \~$1

This is an ambitious but fully doable step that will help keep the USDFL market price at $1.00. The stabilization mechanism deserves a whole article to be explained but we will give a brief description.

One of the factors that can affect the USDFL price is the fact that users might take loans against their initial liquidity pool many times, over and over again. Each time this includes converting USDFL to other stablecoins like DAI or USDC. Obviously, this creates an unusual selling pressure to USDFL, driving its price down.

This proposal will add a possibility for other users to track positions with pools that have been borrowed against many times. If the USDFL starts moving down from $1, some of these positions can be forcefully sold for USDFL, thus driving its price back up. The user that got his LP position liquidated still retains his USDFL borrowed against this loan.

The mechanism is somewhat similar to Keepers in MakerDAO with few major distinctions. It is possible to avoid almost any financial loss to users that got their LP tokens liquidated. Only market players with locked FL will be eligible to liquidate such positions. If one wants to liquidate larger positions and profit more, one has to lock FL for a longer period of time as well. This will prevent possible “liquidation attacks” and also add more utility to the FL token.

# Conclusion

We hope that we have shed some light on the project’s closest future. Of course, the developer team has plans for Q3-Q4 as well but we would like to keep them undisclosed until the time is right. Moreover, the crypto industry is too volatile and the team does not want to give empty promises to our fellow users. Instead, we will adjust as best as we can to any state of the market."

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/stablecoins](https://www.coingecko.com/en/stablecoins)

I just couldn't accept this. I love Maker, to the point that I hate to see this and open a thread to rant. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah I know DAI is growing fast but others are growing faster. Yeah I know Binance it's centralized so it's a meh, but, is hard to swallow this fact

&amp;#x200B;

Can MakerDAO perhaps considering not being so conservative in terms of scaling and growing of DAI? Looking at ETH-B, there is a huge demand, but the debt ceiling has been hit for a while now and the governance is not considering increasing it due to the worry of huge liquidation, debt risk etc. Can the worry be re-considered? We are likely in a bull market now, it is a good time to grow DAI. If ETH were to soar, people will want to leverage with ETH-B. Other platforms like Compound AAVE also has similar collateralization ratio with ETH-B, and they are doing well. 

 

On another note, there are some emergency vote to increase debt ceiling recently and have to wait 2 days for the GSM. This has really limited DAI growth in terms of speed. Since now Maker is resistant to flash loan for voting now, why not considering lowering the GSM, so that all executive votes can be executed faster?"

Brief introduction to some of the top DeFi protocols,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/m0v30z/brief_introduction_to_some_of_the_top_defi/,charmcitycuddles,1,2021-03-09 09:06:40,51,/r/defi/comments/m0v30z/brief_introduction_to_some_of_the_top_defi/,NaN,"Hi all,

I've put together a list of some of the top DeFi projects along with a brief explanation of each:

**Maker DAO** - Lending/Borrowing

MakerDAO is a decentralized system for collateralized loans that people can lock up their ETH in to receive the DAOs stablecoin, DAI. When someone locks up ETH, they are able to take out a loan of a smaller amount in DAI, which is pegged to the US dollar. A deposit of $1000 ETH would allow the user to take out a loan of roughly $650. When the person wants to get their ETH back, they simply pay back their loan along with any fees.
The native token of this protocol, MKR is used in a twofold manner. It primarily acts as a form of support for the loan system as the price of ETH drops. When too many loans are liquidated at once, MKR is created and sold to pay off the loans, as well as bought back from proceeds from liquidation fees. It also serves an additional role as a governance token allowing holders to vote on how high fees should be and which types of collateral should be accepted by the system’s smart contracts.
Maker has become one of the flagship protocols in the DeFi boom but as we saw with markets crash caused by Coronavirus, there remains significant risk investing/pooling money in these protocols which can suddenly become destabilized due to unpredictable events. Though Covid isn’t the first existential crisis Maker has faced, having dealt with hacks in the past, the community has continued to persist and has shown impressive resilience to move past these troubles, often coming out stronger and with a more guided roadmap. It is the largest DeFi protocol by locked value at $6.57 billion.

**Aave** - Lending/Borrowing

Aave is a decentralized network of collateralized lending pools run by smart contracts that allow people to freely lend or borrow crypto. In December 2020, they rolled out version 2 of their protocol. Previously when holders provided crypto for collateral on loans, it was locked in to that collateral. The new update allows users to easily transfer their collateral from one coin to another without having to repay their loan or pull it out of Aave. This increases people’s ability to manage liquidation risk by being able to swap their collateral if the original asset began falling in price.
The governance token, AAVE, is used by holders to determine various changes to the rules and policies of the protocol. Holding the token also provides the user various bonuses such as reduced fees/rates, higher borrowing limits, and advance access to certain pools. Aave has also innovated “flash loans”, uncollateralized short term loans that are issued and settled within the same block of transactions.
Aave’s version 2 is far from the end for this project. CEO Stani Kulechov has mentioned that upcoming changes will improve and add additional nuance to both governance and its flash loans, while also working to reduce gas fees across the board.

**Yearn Finance** - Asset Managent

Yearn Finance is a DeFi protocol that gives users yTokens in exchange for crypto deposits that are then lent out via various other services such as Aave or Compound for the highest rate of return. Yearn.finance was created by Andre Cronje who promptly gave up the protocol and transferred governance to a smart contract that requires a supermajority to institute changes. There is a fixed supply of 30,000 YFI tokens.
Yearn.finance automatically reallocates investors’ funds and finds them the highest yield across various DeFi products. In other words, it gives the average crypto investor access to more advanced strategies through a user friendly user interface. It’s name recognition and ease of use will ensure that as the space continues to grow, it will remain as many investors’ first introductions to field farming strategies.
Though in itself not high risk, Yearn searches a number of high yield bearing products that can oftentimes lead to investors’ funds being put into instruments they may not personally be comfortable with. Though these may not be entirely “unsafe”, It’s fair to ask whether many of the new investors being introduced to DeFi via Yearn would feel comfortable if they knew some of the riskier strategies their funds were subject to. Additionally, the nature of crypto’s rapidly changing market conditions can lead to volatile price swings across the market and the value of yield farming assets are always at risk of becoming worthless.

**Uniswap** - Decentralized Exchange

Uniswap is the most popular and most used decentralized exchange (dex) built on Ethereum. It made headlines last summer when it surprised early users by airdropping 400 UNI tokens (roughly $1,200 at the time) to anyone who had used the platform. The UNI token is used to govern the Uniswap exchange and holders can vote on various proposals and will eventually be the sole decision makers of Uniswap. People can use Uniswap to trade any token built on Ethereum and can also provide Eth and other tokens to supply liquidity, earning fees and sometimes other rewards.
At one point Uniswap held 20% of all funds locked in DeFi protocols and had nearly 50,000 daily users and it still remains hugely popular. Due to the surprise airdrop, the token is widely distributed among the crypto community. It’s also one of the most popular platforms users are introduced to deeper DeFi concepts such as liquidity pools and yield farming.
Many Uniswap users not only use the exchange for swapping their tokens, but also to earn rewards by providing liquidity. Many of these rewards provide outstanding returns which is incredibly enticing. However there’s an underlying risk to it that many people don’t understand well. It’s called Impermanent (or Divergence) Loss and it occurs when the price of the pooled token moves far from the price the user initially provided it for.When the Automated Market Maker sells tokens to maintain the desired ratio, the underlying amounts provided are sightly affected. This risk is often offset by the fees and rewards earned, but could present a significant risk in a volatile market.

**Synthetix** - Derivatives

Synthetix allows holders to stake their SNX tokens to create on-chain synthetic versions of real world assets such as gold, foreign currencies, and recently oil. It also allows holders to create shorting products such as iBTC or iETH. Synthetix was founded by Kain Warwick, having raised nearly $4 million in private funding from Framework Ventures. Governance was originally handled by a foundation which has since been dissolved and replaced by three decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that SNX holders can vote on decisions for the future of the protocol.
Synthetix had over $800 million in total locked value at its height and continues to hold above $700 million staked with over $125 million in circulating synthetic assets. Their success shows the strong demand for the ability to trade censorship free real world assets on-chain and they continue to research, develop, and release new products. Their inverse products (iEth, iBTC, iOIL etc..) are a unique way to introduce shorting strategies to DeFi newcomers as each iSynth token has an entry point, an upper limit, and a lower limit at which point the price is frozen and the inverse asset’s holder is liquidated into a USD pegged stablecoin to help manage risk. Sythentix’s strategy of bridging traditional legacy assets and new digital assets through these innovative products presents a strong case for SNX as the space develops and matures.
One of the downsides to Synthetix is its unusually high collateralization ratio, requiring 750% of staked SNX to the value of the Synth asset. Additionally SNX is more volatile than other assets such as ETH which can lead to higher risk when it comes to keeping your ratio intact. Though staking ETH is available, it offers none of the reward incentives that SNX does.

**Compound** - Lending/Borrowing

Compound is a decentralized crypto lending and borrowing protocol run by algorithms and smart contracts. Anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet such as MetaMask can supply their crypto or borrow assets at interest rates set by real time supply and demand. This allows people to lend and borrow without having to negotiate terms through a middle man such as a bank. When people deposit their crypto funds into Compound, they are provided c-tokens (cETH, cDAI etc) which represent a claim to their portion of the asset pool. Similar to other DeFi protocols, loans are overcollateralized. That is, you must provide more value in crypto as collateral than you can borrow a loan for.
Compound was initially started as a company by Robert Leshner and funded by VC, but since the release of the COMP token has been gradually decentralized handing control and governance to the community. Votes have been held to add coins, adjust interest rates, and various other improvement proposals.
One of the inherent risks in Compound’s model is the risk taken on by borrowers who use the funds to buy more of their collateral. If an investor deposits ETH, then uses their loan to buy more ETH, a sharp drop in the price could lead to not only a call on their loan, but also complete liquidation of their collateralized ETH. Overall, Compound is fairly simple to use and understand which will continue to allow it to be a major player in the DeFi community as more people and institutions join the space.

**RenVM** - Assets and Derivatives

A major problem with the current DeFi system (and really, the overall crypto space) is interoperability. That is, roughly 75% of the total crypto market cap is outside of the Ethereum blockchain and thus not able to participate and interact with the current major DeFi protocols. RenVM is trying to solve this by wrapping outside assets, acting as a decentralized version of BitGo’s WBTC. Someone who holds bitcoin can send their BTC to RenVM which acts as a decentralized custodian, and then issues them the Ethereum token renBTC which is backed, and has the same value as BTC. Not limited to just Ethereum, RenVM can provide this service for just about any digital asset and smart contracting platform.
RenVM’s token, REN is used as a bond to act as a validator “darknode” on the network. It requires 100,000 REN to register and run a node which is locked into a smart contract and not returned until the person deregisters their node. This encourages good behavior from participants. Every time an asset is transferred across chains, a fee is taken which is paid out to the darknode operators.

**Kyber Network** - Decentralized Exchange

Kyber Network is a decentralized exchange and payments tool that allows people to instantly swap their tokens for other tokens without having to deal with a centralized order book. It makes use of pools of crypto funds called “reserves” that allow for several routes to convert the tokens, ultimately finding the best price. Though similar to Loopring, the Kyber Network has a main exchange interface and swaps the token instantly, while Loopring is the underlying protocol and network of many exchanges, and functions as an orderbook.
When converting ETH into another token, the Kyber smart contract first asks various reserves to get the best exchange price. Then, you’ll see the exchange rate and decide whether or not to go through with a swap. If you proceed, you will send 1 ETH to a Kyber smart contract. Once received, the reserve will do an on-chain exchange and your account will be credited with your token of choice. When converting one ERC20 token to another, Kyber uses ETH as the intermediary. That is Token A -&gt; ETH -&gt; Token B.
KNC is the native token of Kyber and reserve holders must pay for their right to manage the reserves with KNC. Holders can also stake their KNC to the KyberDAO which gives them governance rights as well as returning a staking reward. Additionally, it allows vendors who accept cryptocurrency to accept a wide variety, but still get paid in their preferred currency. The Kyber Network works as a service in these types of transactions.

**Loopring** - Decentralized Exchange and Layer 2

Loopring, though similar to Kyber, is unique in this list as it is a decentralized exchange protocol, not a dex itself. What this means is that Loopring allows anybody to build a custodial order-book based exchange on Ethereum (or any other smart-contract platform) and Loopring then combines the pools on those into one massive pool and matches orders across these separate exchanges built using Loopring’s structure and participating in the network. Additionally, when you place your order, your coins remain yours until the order is executed. Your coins aren’t locked into the order book and you can cancel or adjust your order as you please.
Those responsible for matching these orders, miners, are compensated for their work in LRC, and they are incentivized with higher rewards for finding better exchange rates. Loopring is also unique in that it is a Layer Two solution. That is, all transactions and trades take place *off chain* and thus the fees for trading are astronomically lower than Ethereum's during busy times, the downside being that it takes a bit of extra knowledge, and the desire to actually move your crypto there.

**Balancer** - Decentralized Exchange

Balancer is an automated market maker similar to Uniswap in that people can provide their crypto to liquidity pools to earn rewards, but differentiated by the concept that Balancer allows people to create their own Liquidity Pools with up to eight assets pooled instead of just two. The creator of the pool arbitrarily sets the weights of the underlying assets which are automatically rebalanced as the prices fluctuate to maintain the weight. This basically allows anyone to create their own self balancing index fund or invest in someone else’s. A downside to this is increased divergent loss as the prices of the various assets can fluctuate more broadly than is possible with just two assets provided at 1:1. It also leaves open big arbitrage opportunities as there is no oracle integration to bring in outside prices, thus the prices in the pools only change when someone makes a trade.
BAL is the governance token for this protocol and as the protocol develops, BAL holders will be able to “help guide the protocol to its fullest potential.” Balancer specifically names some goals such as deploying the protocol on blockchains other than Ethereum, implementing layer two solutions, introducing fees at the protocol level to generate revenue, and more as examples of actions BAL holders can make.

&amp;#x200B;

* The MakerDAO community will be launching an ‘official’ DAI on Optimism L2.
* Optimism requires a 7 day lockup period when withdrawing tokens back to L1.
* The Maker protocol can reduce this lockup period and allow near-instant withdrawals of DAI.
* This solution can be expanded to cover other token withdrawals in combination with an AMM.
* Initial bridge soon. Fast withdrawals Q3/Q4 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

  
A few weeks ago, I told you to prepare for the changes coming in March. It’s March, and those changes have arrived.  
We’re speeding up the race to decentralization, increasing the scope of privacy, and publishing more documentation and information than ever before. There are only so many hours in a day, so we’re going to use those hours to perfect what we have before jumping into new products.

A few key things to be looking for in the coming month(s) include a new, much more informative website, more comprehensive documentation on tech, more clarity on what’s open source and when the rest will become open-source, and rolling out network upgrades like slashing and privacy v.2.

Be sure to take part in the discussions on these things happening around the forum at [we.incognito.org](http://we.incognito.org/). It’s how you shape privacy going forward.

**I.** **Project overview**

Swipe is a fiat channel for digital assets where users can trade various digital assets in real time with fiat money. It is designed to ""make digital assets the mainstream through the establishment of fiat channels."" Swipe wallet allows users to transfer, store and withdraw crypto assets. Through Swipe's Visa debit card, users can consume digital assets in their wallets in the form of fiat money.

SXP, the functional token of Swipe, is mainly used as the transaction fee, trading medium, and vouchers of discounts in transaction fees for users. In the Swipe system, 80% of transaction fees will be publicly burned on the chain.

&amp;#x200B;

**II. Business Model**

**2.1 Business model**

The Venus protocol was developed by the Swipe wallet, which Binance acquired earlier last year. Venus, a decentralized stablecoin system, is a currency market protocol that aims to introduce a fully decentralized lending system into the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to enable fast and low-cost transactions. In addition, based on the Binance smart chain, Venus will also mint the decentralized stable currency VAI backed by a basket of BEP-20 tokens. Venus can be taken as a hybrid of MakerDAO and Compound, which attempts to reshape the cross-border financial system and strengthen the financial collaboration in the global supply chain.

**2.2 Token economy**

1) Token information

Token name: SXP

Token type: ERC-20

Contract address:

0x8ce9137d39326ad0cd6491fb5cc0cba0e089b6a9

2) Token functions and distribution

The Swipe team decided to limit the maximum supply of SXP to 300 million units. However, as the tokens are burned, the total supply will be gradually reduced until it reaches 100 million units.

https://preview.redd.it/97imspsy7km61.png?width=832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ac81ebed799de34a034a0c1764ef0406c6cf7b4

SXP Distribution Model

As the functional token of Swipe, SXP has five main functions, namely:

① Transaction fee

② Network gas

③ Trading medium

④ Staking certificate

⑤ Voucher for the user to obtain a discount on transaction fees

In the Swipe system, 80% of transaction fees will be publicly burned on the chain.

&amp;#x200B;

**II.** **Exchanges Supported**

Currently, Swipe is supported by CoinEx, Binance, KuCoin, Bittrex, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**III.** **Team profile**

Swipe was established by Joselito Lizarondo in 2018. The team members are experienced in the fields of cryptocurrency and electronic payment. Most of them used to work for well-known international companies such as Binance, VISA, Apple, Samsung, and Google.

https://preview.redd.it/ylth8ku38km61.png?width=894&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8428926a50a04faa468985fa24af10ea5d320c2d

Swipe is headquartered in the Philippines and is currently available in 28 countries/regions in the European Economic Area. It supports fiat currency transactions in Euros, British pounds, U.S. dollars, South Korean won, and Philippine pesos.

In July 2020, Binance announced the completion of the acquisition of crypto startup Swipe. In November of the same year, the start-up Fincofex (later renamed SwipeX), which was acquired by Swipe, announced that it had obtained the master membership of UnionPay International and could directly issue debit cards to consumers and businesses. Swipe plans to integrate this function in early 2021 and launch branded UnionPay cards. (Fincofex has previously obtained Swift membership which allows it to process Swift remittances. It is also a major member of MasterCard in the UK and the European Economic Area and can issue debit cards for businesses)

&amp;#x200B;

**IV.** **Code Overview**

According to the Github open-source code, Swipe currently has 10 main code bases. Among them, code bases of the asset module, Venus protocol module and BSC network module are updated frequently. Overall, the Swipe code base is relatively simple and clear.

[Swipe’s open-source code. Source: Github](https://preview.redd.it/hggixnn78km61.png?width=1146&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=286ac1c22e57ca1ccacd1ff6c67bec56de762f87)

&amp;#x200B;

**VI.** **Risk Evaluation**

On January 14, 2021, Venus was hit by a major security incident. The Venus development team (i.e. the Swipe development team) has issued a new cross-chain project CANNON (cannon.finance), which sells 80 million CAN to private equity investors for a price of $0.02/unit. These tokens could only be used for mortgage lending but not for sale. Later it sold another 100 million CAN to public investors for the same price. After that, Venus announced its support for CAN as collateral, with a mortgage coefficient of 60%, and the mortgage price was determined to be US$0.35 (17 times the price in the private placement). Shortly after, someone deposited CAN “worth US$150 million” to Venus and borrowed the highly liquid assets on the platform, leaving huge losses to ordinary users.

A lot of things coming this month/year! 

UniLend is a permission-less decentralized protocol that combines spot trading services and money markets with lending and borrowing services through smart contracts. 

They will add digital assets outside of the current DeFi ecosystem. There are over 6000 tokens listed on coinmarketcap and only 30 are on Aave, Compound and MakerDao. So there is a big gap there. 

Furthermore they will add trading and lending and borrowing. I really think this is a strong asset for the near future and if they deliver easy top 100 token.

When life turns into a dumpster fire, the best thing we can do is grab our sticks and marshmallows and make s’mores. This week, **inccry** was a shining example of that.

This week, we continued restructuring the Incognito paradigm and fortifying the foundations of privacy, and we’ll continue that effort in the weeks ahead. Our goal is to bring clarity to every facet of the project, and decentralize and open-source even more of the project. Continue sharing your feedback and ideas, and watch for new avenues we’re introducing for you to influence privacy moving forward.

Your role as a protector of privacy is about to get much more intensive, so stay in touch. There’s no need to go at it alone, there’s an entire community of helpful people at [we.incognito.org](http://we.incognito.org/) and in the app’s Community tab.

A while back I uploaded a sourcecred post since maker is a dao and a dao is as strong as the community backing it, the more feedback we get the better we are and we need people giving constructive feedback on proposals, making proposals and spreading the concept of what maker dao is. Specially now that the core units are being developed. 

Now the poll is pretty simple and it´s purpose is to get a grip on how to better channel the communication.

Of course it would be awesome if you could also include some comments, for example if you heard of it but you are not interested why is it? or if you haven´t heard of it but you are interested what would you need to know? Or any related matters to sourcecred for that matter.

* The Alonzo Testnet will finally allow developers to deploy their own decentralized applications on the Cardano blockchain.
* The Alonzo Testnet, which will bring smart contracts to the Cardano (ADA) blockchain, could go live as soon as April, Charles Hoskinson, CEO of the network’s developer IOHK, revealed during the Cardano360 virtual conference yesterday.
* Hoskinson claimed that the Testnet would launch at the end of April or in early May. ""For the first time ever, publicly, people will be able to write smart contracts and deploy them on Cardano,"" he said.
* Per the revealed rollout plan, the Alonzo upgrade will come in the form of a hard fork this spring. Initially, smart contracts will be available for testing purposes only, with the full mainnet launch slated for August.
* The addition of smart contracts marks a major milestone for Cardano, since it will finally make the blockchain a viable competitor to Ethereum. Since last summer, Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has boomed, building on a wide array of decentralized applications (DApps)—all of which are based on smart contracts.
* Now, the same functionality is coming to Cardano. As an example, the blockchain’s developers have presented a Cardano-native dapp that allows users to swap different tokens—much like Ethereum’s “killer dapps” such as Uniswap.
* According to DeFi Pulse, the total value locked in DeFi currently amounts to nearly $40 billion. Meanwhile, major platforms such as MakerDAO, Compound, Aave, and many others are all based on Ethereum’s smart contracts. And with the launch of Alonzo, Cardano will be able to expand into this multi-billion market as well."

[LITT.VN](https://LITT.VN) (ASK @ 0.08)

Roadman Investments Corp.  licensee A3Com Solutions Corp. (""A3Com"") **is pleased to announce that it is entering into strategic partnerships with SATO, a next generation of Stablecoin.**

iCashRewards is very happy to partner with SATO to apply SATO to the iCashRewards ecosystem that combines the utility token (""iCashToken"") with the rewards of a loyalty point that rebates customers for use of iCashRewards eCommerce shopping platform and services. 

iCashToken is planning to merge with SATO. 

Each user from iCashRewards can redeem their iCash Loyalty points ( iCashPoints) with Sato. 

One iCashToken can be exchanged with 1 SATO. 

Each SATO is priced at $1.00, and the exchange will be effective from March 31 to April 15, 2021. 

Going forward, iCashPoints can continue to redeemed cash, USDT, BTC as well as SATO.USDT. SATO is planning to list on various exchanges on April 14, 2021.

**Background**

The crypto industry has seen the rise of various Stablecoins in the last few years. 

These Stablecoins have been built in different ways. 

USDC, HUSD, TrueUSD are backed by fiat USD DAI, Frax, OUSD are collateral based.

SATO is a Stablecoin that is neither fiat backed or collateral based. 

It is purely algorithmic and relies on market forces of supply and demand to maintain its price.

**Current Status of Stablecoin Market:**

Compared with many DeFi projects that attract users to speculate simply by relying on high mining returns, the future application scenarios of algorithmic stablecoins have more room for imagination. 

Currently, the entire algorithmic stablecoin market is still in a stage where its value is heavily underestimated, which is similar to the collateralized stablecoins such as MakerDao in early 2019. 

It is expected that the market will break out.

**AMPL, Basis Cash, ESD, Frax**

At present, the market value of DeFi is growing rapidly and there are countless projects. 

However, there are still no more than ten products that are available for use in the algorithmic stablecoin market. 

The well-known algorithmic stablecoins include AMPL, Basic Cash, ESD and Frax. Among them, only the prices of AMPL and Frax can be maintained around 1 USD. 

Although AMPL's algorithm has been modified several times by latecomers, it is still in the leading position of algorithmic stablecoins, which is similar to the position of PoW in the main chain.

 Therefore, the current single currency inflation &amp; deflation model (rebase) of AMPL has been tested by the market.

**What is SATO?**

SATO is a next generation algorithmic stable coin. SATO relies on the invisible market forces of supply and demand to maintain its price stability. 

USD and collateral backed Stablecoins have various flaws and are not suited to the crypto ecosystem.

USD backed Stablecoins rely on the broken monetary infrastructure of central banks to provide stability. As a result, the Stablecoin's stability is derived from the backed currency itself. 

Similarly, collateral backed Stablecoins use other Stablecoins with USD backed collateral. Thus, the underlying system is still reliant on the flaws of USD backed Stablecoins.

SATO doesn't rely on any centralized fiat currency such as USD. It can maintain its price stability algorithmically via smart contracts.

""We are very excited to see the users from iCashRewards have the ability to redeem the first DeFi revolutionary stablecoin SATO (""SATO"") and a Roadman subsidiary will mine the SATO through the SATO's liquidity pool once it is opened. 

We like the name ""SATO"" as it is an inspiration from Satoshi Nakamoto, a name used by the presumed pseudonymous person or persons who developed bitcoin, authored the bitcoin white paper, and created and deployed bitcoin's original reference implementation,"" states Luke Montaine, CEO of Roadman Investments.

Roadman Investments Corp.  licensee A3Com Solutions Corp. (""A3Com"") **is pleased to announce that it is entering into strategic partnerships with SATO, a next generation of Stablecoin.**

iCashRewards is very happy to partner with SATO to apply SATO to the iCashRewards ecosystem that combines the utility token (""iCashToken"") with the rewards of a loyalty point that rebates customers for use of iCashRewards eCommerce shopping platform and services. 

iCashToken is planning to merge with SATO. 

Each user from iCashRewards can redeem their iCash Loyalty points ( iCashPoints) with Sato. 

One iCashToken can be exchanged with 1 SATO. 

Each SATO is priced at $1.00, and the exchange will be effective from March 31 to April 15, 2021. 

Going forward, iCashPoints can continue to redeemed cash, USDT, BTC as well as SATO.USDT. SATO is planning to list on various exchanges on April 14, 2021.

**Background**

The crypto industry has seen the rise of various Stablecoins in the last few years. 

These Stablecoins have been built in different ways. 

USDC, HUSD, TrueUSD are backed by fiat USD DAI, Frax, OUSD are collateral based.

SATO is a Stablecoin that is neither fiat backed or collateral based. 

It is purely algorithmic and relies on market forces of supply and demand to maintain its price.

**Current Status of Stablecoin Market:**

Compared with many DeFi projects that attract users to speculate simply by relying on high mining returns, the future application scenarios of algorithmic stablecoins have more room for imagination. 

Currently, the entire algorithmic stablecoin market is still in a stage where its value is heavily underestimated, which is similar to the collateralized stablecoins such as MakerDao in early 2019. 

It is expected that the market will break out.

**AMPL, Basis Cash, ESD, Frax**

At present, the market value of DeFi is growing rapidly and there are countless projects. 

However, there are still no more than ten products that are available for use in the algorithmic stablecoin market. 

The well-known algorithmic stablecoins include AMPL, Basic Cash, ESD and Frax. Among them, only the prices of AMPL and Frax can be maintained around 1 USD. 

Although AMPL's algorithm has been modified several times by latecomers, it is still in the leading position of algorithmic stablecoins, which is similar to the position of PoW in the main chain.

 Therefore, the current single currency inflation &amp; deflation model (rebase) of AMPL has been tested by the market.

**What is SATO?**

SATO is a next generation algorithmic stable coin. SATO relies on the invisible market forces of supply and demand to maintain its price stability. 

USD and collateral backed Stablecoins have various flaws and are not suited to the crypto ecosystem.

USD backed Stablecoins rely on the broken monetary infrastructure of central banks to provide stability. As a result, the Stablecoin's stability is derived from the backed currency itself. 

Similarly, collateral backed Stablecoins use other Stablecoins with USD backed collateral. Thus, the underlying system is still reliant on the flaws of USD backed Stablecoins.

SATO doesn't rely on any centralized fiat currency such as USD. It can maintain its price stability algorithmically via smart contracts.

""We are very excited to see the users from iCashRewards have the ability to redeem the first DeFi revolutionary stablecoin SATO (""SATO"") and a Roadman subsidiary will mine the SATO through the SATO's liquidity pool once it is opened. 

We like the name ""SATO"" as it is an inspiration from Satoshi Nakamoto, a name used by the presumed pseudonymous person or persons who developed bitcoin, authored the bitcoin white paper, and created and deployed bitcoin's original reference implementation,"" states Luke Montaine, CEO of Roadman Investments.
