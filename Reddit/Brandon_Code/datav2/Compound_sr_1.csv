USDC: 8.74% supply, 11.11% borrow

USDT: 13.67% supply, 16.56% borrow

When we are talking about the governance of a money market this is to be expected, but has anyone else thought there should be a way for smaller COMP holders to have more collective power?

What if someone were to create a DAO in which smaller COMP holders would delegate to, and whenever a proposal is up for vote, COMP holders in this DAO would vote which way they want the DAO to vote (potentially 51% or higher).  If this gained enough traction, a ""public interest"" non-profit DAO could potentially be among the top addresses by voting weight.  

We could even implement some semblance of yield farming, by incentivizing people to delegate COMP and vote in the DAO by issuing some sort of DAO governance token.    

Sure this idea needs some fleshing out, but I'd be willing to work on it with anyone else that is interested.

We recently enabled [transactional privacy for COMP using Secret Network](https://scrt.network/blog/secret-ethereum-bridge-is-live-on-mainnet). Today, I’m writing about an opportunity to earn yield with your COMP. 

Secret Network community is starting bridge mining program starting Tuesday January 12 for 6 weeks, during which 250K SCRT will be distributed to bridge depositors. The more value locked on Secret Network - Ethereum bridge, the better anonymity for its users. ERC20 pools with more than $100K TVL will be eligible for SCRT bridge rewards.

What can you do with the bridge now?

I have a wallet on Coinbase and a wallet in ledger.  The coinbase wallet currently says tether is earning 2.5% apr.  The Ledger wallet says Tether is earning 1.67% APY.

Based on this, I put some USDT in coinbase a few weeks ago, and it tells me that I've earned $0.13 in that time.

yesterday I decided to do the same in Ledger.  I wanted to make my coins more secure so I moved some tether into ledger, and set up the lending contract.  After 24 hours, it's already earned $0.25 in interest.  

Why are they earning such different rates?  Why is the lower APY actually earning more interest?"

I've been using crypto for a little under a month now, and I've been trying to use Compound Finance. I know that to transfer the Ethereum based tokens, I need some Eth to pay for gas, but It seems to be unrealistically high.  
I have only seen gas prices reach around $8 at the highest whenever I've been transferring tokens, but using compound on the Exodus wallet, it wants me to use over $160 of Eth at the current market price.  
The exact words are 

 A minimum balance of 0.12375 ETH is needed to use this App.   
 Exchange for or deposit at least 0.11017157 ETH into your wallet and then try again 

This is even more confusing to me because in the official Exodus tutorial, the guy says that he usually has around $20 worth of Eth.

Why is it all so much more expensive compared to regular Eth based transfers?"

Peanut joins forces with Curve!! This is mega bullish guys!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/l1b3qw/peanut_joins_forces_with_curve_this_is_mega/,Useful_Platform_,1,2021-01-20 23:15:02,0,/r/Compound/comments/l1b3qw/peanut_joins_forces_with_curve_this_is_mega/,NaN,"Peanut will connect its protocol to Curve to balance price of trading pairs. In addition to the unique formula for equalizing the value of tokens in Curve trading pairs (more information in this article), Peanut will create for Curve users an additional layer of protection from slippage and from skewing the tokens value.

Due to the high volatility of the crypto asset market, the lack of unified trading platforms, as well as dynamic changes in supply/demand for a particular asset, crypto traders are quite often exposed to slippage as one of the negative factors.

Curve protects its users from slippage by using a unique formula for determining the value of assets in trading pairs. Additionally, Peanut protocol will integrate with Curve which will result in reducing negative effect from slippage and mitigating risks of impermanent loss. Due to the system of a two-level pool of assets operated by Peanut, placing even a very large order will have only temporary instant effect. When large buy/sell orders are executed, the Peanut pool automatically and simultaneously makes the corresponding deal on two levels, that is, on other DEX and CEX, and provides additional liquidity for specific trading pair. As a result, slippage in trading pair disappears.

At the moment, the Peanut team is winding up with integrational settings for Curve trading platform. In a few weeks Curve will be connected to Peanut protocol on the regular basis.

Speaking about Curve, Alex Momot, CEO at Remme and founder of Peanut said:

“The main challenge for us during the testing period is to check the ability to resist one-block flash loan attacks. Successful results will significantly improve AMM mechanics and will give much more confidence to all market participants.”

&gt;*Michael Egorov, CEO of Curve, said:*  
*“Balancing prices by exploiting liquidity on both DEX and CEX platforms is really a good idea. And also very promising. It will be very interesting to see the results of Peanut testing on Curve.”*

Peanut solves existing problems inherent in both centralized and decentralized trading platforms. Namely, the loss of customers as a result of slippage. And we are doing everything we can to improve our algorithms.

The transaction went through successfully but I don’t have my funds. Are they gone for ever, are they in limbo? Can anyone help or advise me on what I can do next to either get my funds back or reverse the transaction? I own both accounts. I can also look at the transaction on etherscan and MetaMask. I just don’t know what to do. Thank you so much in advance."

Why does it not give the interest earned as well?"

Insane network fees when I try to withdraw????,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/l8fd1c/insane_network_fees_when_i_try_to_withdraw/,NelsonQuant667,1,2021-01-30 14:04:47,5,/r/Compound/comments/l8fd1c/insane_network_fees_when_i_try_to_withdraw/,Question,"So I haven’t used Compound in while, however I still have like $10 worth of Bat tokens that I figured I wanted to withdraw. I link up my meta mask wallet, the same one I used when I sent them to Compound, which has cBat tokens in it. Whenever I try to withdraw, metamask tries to charge me like $36 network fees. Not happening. Out of curiosity I go to coin base and try to send a little ether to see what I’m charged, the network fee in coinbase is only $1 or so. Clearly Am I missing something. Additionally, if I try to disable the Bat tokens as collateral in Compound, it also opens up metamask and still tries to charge me around $23. Any info would be appreciated!!"
