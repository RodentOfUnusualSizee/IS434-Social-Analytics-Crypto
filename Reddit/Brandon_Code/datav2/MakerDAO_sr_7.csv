So I wonder if there are any plans to create a new DAI bound to the value of one of those CBDCs at a specific point in time. The decrease / increase of the supply of that CBDC can be used to build a actually stable coin as long as that CBDC exists, no matter how fast the money printer of that CBDC goes.

In those terms CBDCs could be the base for a new class of quality stable coins."

Invest it in a stablecoinfarm for 5%. 

Put the investment as colleteral back in the vault. 

So now I have 100k$ in ETH + 50k in a stable farm and borrowed 50kDai and decreased my colleteralization ratio. 

If ETH drops 50% I still have assets of 100k$. I Mean eth could letteraly drop to 0 and it would still be colleteralized 1:1. This way you could even undercolleteralize loans.  Like invest 10k$ and farm stables with 100k$... What do you think?"

Lippo Francesco: - the idea came from a visit to his home, I saw a myriad of unknown paintings in the world.
I decided to take inspiration and create something that could give life to those works and other works.

I couldn't really figure out from the functional steps and the working of the bots what the overall picture looks like. You know, not seeing the forest if standing in front of a tree.

So I have a few questions that are related to a collaterals (heavy) price crash and the mechanism.

1. Are large vaults liquations prioritized in some way to minimise the damage and potentially minimise the uncovered damage for last insurance MKR holders? Like use the free money in the market to focus on the big chunks first.

2. Given a highly collateralized vault (for example like the therefore designed ETH-C pool, or even anyone with 900% coverage) would all the ETH be up for bidding or just the necessary part? Sure with perfect bidding it should turn out the same. However given market dynamics I would find it suboptimal to liquidate 800eth for only 1000 DAI missing. If it's only the necessary, let's say, conservatively 6-7 ETH it seems more money efficient.

3. In case these large blocks are put up for bidding, how is it made widely accessible? Is it possible to split it up? Only few players could bid for a 6000 ETH liquidation, however finding 6000 bids for 1 ETH seems more efficient (to me at least). I can't bid for the Mona Lisa even knowing it's true value, it's simply impossible for me, but I could bid for a tiny piece and help with that part. Win-Win.

4. In case question 2. or 3. are a no, are changes planned? Are my concerns invalid and how come?"

Some thoughts:  
1) Have an LLC hold the lien on the house, and in that LLC's articles of incorporation indicate that the assets of the LLC are the property of the NFT holder.

2) Have a traditional mortgage company write the loan then work with Tinlake as an asset originator to tokenize the mortgage. Obviously this would have to be a savvy mortgage company, of which I'm not aware of any.

However, I have a question that I couldn't find the answer for: Do all vaults count when it comes to liquidation or only the one vault where Dai were generated from ?

For example, I put 0.1 BTC in a vault and generate 2k Dai. Then I put 2 ETH in another vault. Do these 2 ETH count also as collateral or will my BTC vault be liquidated if my debt crosses the liquidation point of (only) my 0.1 BTC ?
