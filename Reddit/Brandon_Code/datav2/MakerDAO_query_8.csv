Why Yieldly and other Farm/Governance tokens have value,https://www.reddit.com/r/yieldly/comments/ovj8a9/why_yieldly_and_other_farmgovernance_tokens_have/,Brawlstar-Terminator,1,2021-08-01 09:32:41,18,/r/yieldly/comments/ovj8a9/why_yieldly_and_other_farmgovernance_tokens_have/,NaN,"I've noticed this question pop up a few times in this sub and I thought writing a post on it would be helpful to others. When I first started learning about DEFI, I was stumped on this question too. Obligatory statement that none of this is financial advice, this is purely for educational reasons. The smarter people are with their money and learn more about DEFI, the ecosystem benefits as a whole. Alright lets get into it:

&amp;#x200B;

**WHAT ARE FARM/GOVERNACE TOKENS?**

Farm tokens are tokens paid out to users who provide liquidity for a protocol. They incentivize users to give their funds to the DEX/AMM/DAO because they can receive these tokens as reward. They take on the risk of impermenant loss or smart contract failures to receive the rewards of the farm token and any fees that the liquidity pool pair generates. 

Governance tokens are farm tokens that allow the holders to make decentralized changes to the protocol through voting (much like Algorand). They are farm tokens with the extra utility of being able to vote. 

If you notice, YLDY right now functions solely as a farming token. It has no other utility aside from receiving it as a reward for providing liquidity in ALGO and YLDY. There are future plans to make YLDY a governance token, so it will accrue even more value once we can use them to vote.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this is fine and dandy, but why do people pay so much for these tokens? What do they do? Why do they have value? Why does this protocol even need a token?

&amp;#x200B;

**WHY FARM/GOVERNANCE TOKENS HAVE VALUE**

1. **Bootstrap Growth of the Protocol:** Tokens create interest for the protocol via airdrops and liquidity mining incentives. Remember how much buzz there was for yieldly because of the July 4th token airdrop? It serves as a form of marketing and a way of distributing the token to reward early users. Uniswap's famous airdrop is worth about $3000 right now. It also allows the protocol to incentivize users and promote growth. In the future, Yieldly could partner with AlgoMint and have liquidity mining rewards where they pay out a higher percentage of YLDY to users who deposit gBTC or gETH. This would make more users bridge their BTC and ETH via Algomint and give them growth and promotion as well. 
2. **Aligns Incentives Between Users and Protocol:** Protocols need governance tokens to incentivize early users. The more people use yieldly, the more value the token will accrue because people will speculate on the future functionality of the token. Uniswap holders speculate it will soon function like Sushiswap tokens, and allow holders to receive 0.05% of all trading fees on the platform. It also rewards the early users who took on the most risk because they were the first to use the protocol and provide feedback. Right now, Yieldly doesn't have much. Imagine in 5 years when the UI is updated and you can swap ALGO&lt;-&gt;YLDY instantly with low fees. It's the hub of blockchain interoperability with ETH, BNB, DOT users bridging their funds through YLDY to move cross-chain. Early users had to suffer through all the growing pains (remember week 4 rewards) and must be rewarded for that.
3. **Incentivizes the developers to keep working on the project:** The token serves as an incentive for the team to continue working on the protocol and make it as good as it can be. The better the Dapp becomes and the more users and liquidity it has, the more value the developers tokens are worth. The Yieldly team can also sell off a percentage of their tokens to hire more developers, raise money for certain projects or attract talented developers who want to work on the biggest protocols in an ecosystem.
4. **Protects the Protocol through Network Effects:** Governance tokens naturally create network affects that act as each protocols competitive moat. 99% of applications on Ethereum are open source. This means that anyone can copy the code, creating a fork of the Dapp. If projects can be forked(essentially making the same application) why does the original have a premium? The original protocol ALWAYS has the strongest network effects. The holders of the token are incentivized to use and maintain the value of the network. This is why although Sushiswap is arguably better than Uniswap(because Sushi lets you stake for 0.05% of all fees), Uniswap still has a higher marketcap and more users because of its first mover advantage.
5. **You need the Farm token to provide liquidity with it in a LP:** Farm tokens are higher risk, as part of their value is derived from the success of the network. Since they are higher risk, they pay out higher rewards when you provide liquidity with them. This is why staking YLDY offers you 50% APY compared to the 10% APY of depositing ALGO. For users who want to participate in the higher risk/reward pool, they have to buy the farm token.

&amp;#x200B;

**Importance of Governance**

Governance is very important utility for a token and hopefully the Yieldly team implements this soon. These are the biggest changes to Ethereum protocols that were done through governance that impacted the price of the token:

1. **Token Buybacks:** MakerDao and Vesper voted on a change where the protocol uses its treasury to buyback tokens in the market. This reduces the supply in the market, thus raising the price of the token. They can then chose to burn these tokens or redistribute them to holders.
2. **Revenue Distribution:** We discussed this one earlier, but we saw these changes in Sushiswap and Ren. To incentivize people to run nodes on Ren, holders voted to allow node runners to receive a percentage of the total fees whenever someone uses the Ren virtual machine. With Sushiswap, you can stake your sushi tokens to earn xsushi, which you can stake to earn .05% of the liquidity reserve.
3. **Deploying LP's/minting synthetic assets:** Uniswap and Synthetix hold governance votes before adding assets to their respective protocols. Uniswap votes before adding or removing certain liquidity pairs. For synthetix, they manually approve through governance which synthetic stock or index that will be issued on their protocol. This helps keep the protocol relatively safe, and makes it easier for retail investors to swap the right tokens. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, Protocols can also use tokens to affect user behaviour. On Bancor(a DEX), the longer you provide liquidity in a pool the higher percentage of fees you earn. This incentivizes user to keep their liquidity in the pool for as long as possible, so they can earn higher rewards. AAVE does this through increasing/decreasing interest rates on certain assets. If AAVE is running low on USDT, and there are more borrowers than lenders, AAVE will temporarily increase the APY on USDT to make more users deposit USDT onto the protocol. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have only been in DEFI for about 6 months, so if anyone needs to correct me I will make changes. DEFI is high risk, but higher rewards. We are betting on the Yieldly team to add utility to the token, so it won't go to zero. If they deliver, this speculation can turn into tangible rewards. Many degenerate Yield farms see their farm tokens go to zero. This is because there is no other utility with the token aside from farming with it to earn more of the token. Yieldly currently functions as speculative token that might trend to zero like 90% of farms on Ethereum/Polygon. If the utility is added, then it will be worth substantially more than it is now. These are the risks we take as DEFI and Yield farmers.

&amp;#x200B;

I see a lot of people saying what will the price be in 1-2 years. The truth is, no one knows. But we can do our research and speculate with as much information as we can. Keep in mind bear markets are harsh in crypto, and most altcoins see significant losses. Yieldly is a 4-5 year hold for me. When the next bear market comes, I will just DCA and HODL. No one knows what will happen in the next couple years, but you have to take a longer term objective approach to investing.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Farming and governance tokens incentivize users to add liquidity by paying users in their token. People who receive these tokens are more aligned with the protocol, and are more likely to use the network over other alternatives. Governance allows these tokens to make changes that impact the utility and tokenomics of the token, letting it accrue even more value."

**About BakerDAO:** 

BakerDAO is an upgrade MakerDAO protocol on Binance Smart Chain(BSC). It is a multi-collateral stablecoin borrow system on BSC, which allow users to generate decentralized stablecoin BAI by leveraging collateral assets like BNB, BUSD, ETH, BTC and so on. Excess collateral, self-balance system, liquidators and other ecosystem participants ensure that 1 BAI is soft-pegged to 1 USD. BKR is the decentralized governance token of BakerDAO, and its holders can use it to initiate proposals and vote to govern the major events or decide development directions for BakerDAO."

So my ETH disappears to the buyer and MakerDAO receives some DAI which is then immediately burned

# B.Protocol

&gt;B.Protocol is a Backstop liquidity protocol for DeFi lending platforms, currently integrated on top of MakerDAO and Compound. Users of B.Protocol give priority to the Backstop liquidators in the liquidation process, and the liquidators in return share the liquidation profits with the users. B.Protocol is fully decentralized and is governed by $BPRO holders. 

Website: [https://bprotocol.org](https://bprotocol.org)

# RAI protocol

&gt;RAI is a non-pegged stable asset and automated credit facility which recently implemented self-repaying loans. RAI can only be borrowed against ETH. 

Website: [https://reflexer.finance](https://reflexer.finance/)

# Going forward

The following announcement was made on Discord about the road ahead:

&gt; **RAI and B.Protocol snapshots have passed and will be integrated into the DeFi Smart Layer!**  
&gt;  
&gt;In the next few days the team will enable the RAI and B.Protocol Connectors enabling their use throughout the DeFi Smart Layer.  
&gt;  
&gt;**When will we see RAI and B.Protocol on the main interface?**   
There is no time horizon for these integrations on the main interface. You an access and test out their operations on Instadapp Terminal.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the next few weeks we will release Instadapp Assembly our new open source dashboard, where we can start creating some use cases and build interfacing for these connectors. We will encourage both the teams, the newly created **#🛠-assembly** guild and community members to begin building out strategies for these connectors."

Everybody’s doing fractional co-ownership projects these days, or turning physical art into an NFT, but OMNIA is more than that. OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here’s how they do that

* Making high value assets easily accessible &amp; investable, lowering entry point for wealth creation
* Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked 
* Focusing on indexing before derivatives
* Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age
* Liquidity for the middle class

# Here’s how it works:

* $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate ready to tokenise with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022
* 3 Tokens (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin)
* Unique business model (Token price is linked with how successful the business is)
* 10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go)
* Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)

&amp;#x200B;

They’ve been building in super stealth mode until earlier this month, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan. 

* Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK
* Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney
* Recent coverage in The Capital- more press in the coming weeks 
* Certified GDPR practitioner, focusing majority of her time on compliance
* Smart contracts successfully audited by Blockchain Consilium
* Cyber security checks later in the month

$OMNIA will have three coins!

1. $OMNIA - about to go into **its presale** 
2. OAT- will be created after full regulatory approval
3. OSC- Stable coin packed by the pool of OATS

🚀 The pre sale has started, make sure you don’t miss out on this low cap gem 💥 :

* Major Marketing and Branding Experts added to the team (Marketing team is now 11 people, with the recent addition one of the minds behind CUMROCKET) 🤯
* Major Partnership in the Works (unnamed for now as fine details are being ironed out) 🧐
* Legal Entity Created 🏢
* Staking and Farming available at launch🧳
* Aggressive burn mechanisms 👨‍👦‍👦
* On MATIC chain✅
* Great Website 
* Real asset oracle- not an API🚀 
* **Compliant in AML, GDPR, KYC 💎**
* Exchange listing later this year 👀
* SUPER 🔥🔥🔥 MARKETING PUSH
* OMNIA is bringing fair trade to crypto! 

# Short term benefits

* First 150 people who buy tokens and post in the group will receive a space on the DAO
* Right of first refusal to assets on the platform
* AGGRESSIVE BURN within 1st 6 months
* Long term benefits
* Freeing cash from illiquid assets
* Omnia DeFi tokens can serve as the blockchain layer of infrastructure for many developing nations! (The modern day equivalent of building railroads or highways) Think Google but for indexing real world assets that can be traded. 
* Part of the Createlinx ecosystem
* Allowing people to own a part of history or the world in a. New and innovative way

Furthermore the OMINA DeFi team will reply to any question you have regarding the business, they’re so transparent!

**OMNIA’S potential far surpasses popular cryptocurrencies**.

Delegation is live in MakerDAO!,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/ox27xn/delegation_is_live_in_makerdao/,LongForWisdom,1,2021-08-03 20:15:13,29,/r/MakerDAO/comments/ox27xn/delegation_is_live_in_makerdao/,NaN,"Delegation has now been launched for the Maker Protocol. If you hold MKR and haven't been voting in the past, please give serious consideration to delegating your MKR to one or more of Maker's Recognised Delegates.

**Ineffective or participation-starved governance will kill the Maker Protocol over the long-term just as surely as governance attacks will in the short term.**

If you are holding capital in the MKR Token you should seriously consider delegating responsibly. The safest and lowest-effort way of doing this is to split your MKR across the Recognised Delegates. Alternatively, taking a little more time and determining which delegate you prefer is also advisable.  

**Here are a couple of highlights:**

* Each Recognised Delegate has a public profile that describes their values and plans for the Maker Protocol.
* You can split your MKR across different delegates.
* Delegation contracts expire after one year, so plan to check in on occasion. 
* You can also delegate to one of the Shadow Delegates, but this is more risky and there are less guarantees as to delegate consistency and performance. 

**Here are some recommended considerations (taken from the MKR Holder's Guide to Delegation.)**

* **Trust**  
Delegation is an expression of trust of the MKR Holder in the delegate.
* **Incentives**  
Examine your delegate’s incentives, these are not solely monetary, these are not always permanent.
* **Recognition**  
Recognised Delegates are safer than Shadow Delegates (but not by much).
* **Balance**  
Be aware of the checks on power among delegates and Core Units. Having only a few large delegates is a risk. Delegation to Core Unit personnel is not advised by GovAlpha.
* **Cost-Benefit**  
Responsible Voting &gt; Responsible Delegation &gt; Apathy &gt; Irresponsible Voting &gt; Irresponsible Delegation. Responsible delegation is much, much cheaper than responsible voting and almost as good

**And here are several resources:**

* [The Recognised Delegates Code of Conduct](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/recognised-delegate-code-of-conduct/9384) \- The Recognised Delegates are required to meet these criteria. 
* [The Token Holder's Delegation Agreement](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/token-holders-delegation-agreement/9385) \- Describes the holder-delegate relationship from the PoV of the Holder.
* [The MKR Holders Guide to Delegation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mkr-holder-s-guide-to-delegation/9602) \- Describes the risks and considerations that should be understood by MKR Holders prior to delegating their MKR.

Let us be clear, there is no stable coin backed 1:1 with USD, including the often suggested USDC.

If you are looking for a new stable coin to keep your money in during dips or to earn interest on, look no further than DAI :DAI:

* DAI is the only coin issued by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (MakerDAO), making it the only truly decentralized stable coin.
* DAI is backed by a variety of Crypto Assets and is algorithmically programmed to balance assets, collateral, interest rates and circulator supply to maintain price stability.
* DAI is the Stable Coin of the xDAI Chain.  xDAI is a SideChain of the Ethereum network that offers fast speeds and low transaction fees for popular projects and dAPPs like Gnosis, HoneySwap, SushiSwap, Agave and many others.  **xDAI is also the initial chain of xMOONs** (now porting to Arbitrum), meaning they were one of the first Cryptos/Chains/Organizations to support our r/CryptoCurrency community.
* DAI is available on most popular exchanges, and has liquidity pools and yield farming across most of the popular DeFi platforms.
* As of this post, USDC has Blacklisted 8 addressed, and USDT has Blacklisted over 400.  DAI has blacklisted 0 addresses, making it the least censorship-prone Stable Coin of the bunch.

If you want a Stable Coin that stays true to the purpose of CryptoCurrency (Decentralized Money), yet is still widely available and usable across the multitude of CryptoCurrency platforms and ecosystems, DAI is the clear-cut choice.

# General Conclusion

MakerDAO is one of the core project on DeFi. The foundation of the project is built on the Ethereum blockchain. The two main components are $DAI (stablecoin) and $MKR (governance). The protocol creates $DAI that is backed by $ETH using a vault mechanism.This system is able to regulate and stabilise the price of $DAI stablecoin. This protocol is also the first successful onchain reserve stablecoin.

# Stablecoin Classification

The mechanisms of stablecoins have changed since 2017 and we're going to start classifying stablecoins into four different categories:

&gt;Check the previous newsletter if you want more clarity.

1. Mechanisms
2. Peg
3. Collateral Amount
4. Collateral Type

# MakerDAO

In MakerDAO’s ecosystem, $DAI is the stablecoin and uses a dual token and reserve mechanism. It is soft pegged to one dollar and uses over-collateralisation to get that one dollar. It uses different kinds of on-chain crypto assets like $ETH, stablecoins, and non-stablecoins.

## Dual Token Mechanism

In the dual token model, as the name suggests, there are two tokens in the system. The primary token is stablecoin $DAI which is soft pegged to the US dollar. The secondary token is $MKR. The main function of the secondary token is to absorb volatility in the system. Think of $DAI as your output which is stable and has low volatility, but because there will always be volatility within the system or outside of the system. The volatility needs to go somewhere, so it goes to the other token, $MKR.

## Functions of the MKR Token

This is a utility token and functions as a governance token for voting. It can be used to pay off interest accrued in the system, and during insolvency. During crashes or different kinds of liquidation $MKR can be minted and sold for $DAI in the ecosystem. $MKR is a crucial aspect of governing the entire system of $DAI. $DAI is the facilitator that allows people to exchange goods and services. A few months ago MakerDAO moved more of its funds towards the DAO which means that it is no longer mainly controlled by the founders and is now controlled by the community.

## Reserve Mechanism

This means that the stablecoin or the $DAI is backed by reserves and you can use the $DAI to redeem the underlying collateral. You can redeem $DAI for the underlying crypto assets that you deposited to get $DAI initially.

# Creating $DAI: How it Works

You can create $DAI in three simple steps:

1. You have to own the asset.
2. You deposit that asset into a vault.
3. Based on the amount of value in the vault you can mint some $DAI out and then can use it in some other system.

The only thing that you have to be careful about is the minimum collateralisation ratio. If I have $150 worth of $ETH and I put it in my vault then I can take out a maximum of 100 $DAI from this vault and spend it somewhere else. My $150 worth of $ETH sits in the vault. I cannot touch it until I repay the amount that I borrowed, which is 100 $DAI.

## What happens when your $ETH falls in value?

I put $150 worth of $ETH in the vault but if the value falls to $100 then my collateralisation ratio is 100% which is less than the ideal amount of 150%. Now I will have to either repay the loan (instead of borrowing 100 $DAI I must repay 33 $DAI) or I will have to add $50 worth of $ETH into the collateral so that the minimum collateralisation ratio or the *c-ratio* is balanced."

This means that the stablecoin or the $DAI is backed by reserves and you can use the $DAI to redeem the underlying collateral. You can redeem $DAI for the underlying crypto assets that you deposited to get $DAI initially.

# Creating $DAI: How it Works

You can create $DAI in three simple steps:

1. You have to own the asset.
2. You deposit that asset into a vault.
3. Based on the amount of value in the vault you can mint some $DAI out and then can use it in some other system.

The only thing that you have to be careful about is the minimum collateralisation ratio. If I have $150 worth of $ETH and I put it in my vault then I can take out a maximum of 100 $DAI from this vault and spend it somewhere else. My $150 worth of $ETH sits in the vault. I cannot touch it until I repay the amount that I borrowed, which is 100 $DAI.

## What happens when your $ETH falls in value?

I put $150 worth of $ETH in the vault but if the value falls to $100 then my collateralisation ratio is 100% which is less than the ideal amount of 150%. Now I will have to either repay the loan (instead of borrowing 100 $DAI I must repay 33 $DAI) or I will have to add $50 worth of $ETH into the collateral so that the minimum collateralisation ratio or the *c-ratio* is balanced."

# General Conclusion

MakerDAO is one of the core project on DeFi. The foundation of the project is built on the Ethereum blockchain. The two main components are $DAI (stablecoin) and $MKR (governance). The protocol creates $DAI that is backed by $ETH using a vault mechanism.This system is able to regulate and stabilise the price of $DAI stablecoin. This protocol is also the first successful onchain reserve stablecoin.

# MakerDAO

In MakerDAO’s ecosystem, $DAI is the stablecoin and uses a dual token and reserve mechanism. It is soft pegged to one dollar and uses over-collateralisation to get that one dollar. It uses different kinds of on-chain crypto assets like $ETH, stablecoins, and non-stablecoins.

## Dual Token Mechanism

In the dual token model, as the name suggests, there are two tokens in the system. The primary token is stablecoin $DAI which is soft pegged to the US dollar. The secondary token is $MKR. The main function of the secondary token is to absorb volatility in the system. Think of $DAI as your output which is stable and has low volatility, but because there will always be volatility within the system or outside of the system. The volatility needs to go somewhere, so it goes to the other token, $MKR.

## Functions of the MKR Token

This is a utility token and functions as a governance token for voting. It can be used to pay off interest accrued in the system, and during insolvency. During crashes or different kinds of liquidation $MKR can be minted and sold for $DAI in the ecosystem. $MKR is a crucial aspect of governing the entire system of $DAI. $DAI is the facilitator that allows people to exchange goods and services. A few months ago MakerDAO moved more of its funds towards the DAO which means that it is no longer mainly controlled by the founders and is now controlled by the community.

A new solution I just found about is called Neon EVM, which has nothing to do with Neon, the blockchain formerly known as Antshares.  Strategic on their part? Maybe. Confusing and annoying for us? Yes!

This Neon EVM thing is just a smart contract on the Solana blockchain, without the need of a parachain to run the evm interpreter. Its right on the order book, so it has the fastest finality because it can interpret EVM code in * parallel * whereas normal eth evm code is sequential, meaning much higher throughput is possible with Neon. 

If im understanding this correctly, anyone can use this without having to port your whole dapp to Rust.  Its on the Solana testnet right now and will support big projects like Uniswap, Sushiswap, MakerDAO and 0x at launch this quarter, said Cointelegraph.

I was one of only 445 people watched their AMA, meaning most people are sleeping on this thing. (Its on Youtube)

This feels like the start of something bigger, because even if ETH2 was finished tomorrow this thing has the fee and speed advantage. Where's the catch?

Curious if anyone else knows about it and can explain the drawbacks like centralization.  The only one I can think of is the low number of validators Solana has as you gotta have bank to even spin one up, but 850+ validators is still pretty decent for a mainnet that went live a year ago,and has the blessing of Alameda Research's infinite cashola and other top VCs.

BACKGROUND 

The current infrastructure for the information of the internet is one of convenience and relatively good reliability. It’s designed and does have a very good capability of sending and receiving data. However, this convenience is outweighed by the the reliance of centralisation. Our data that we send back and forth are controlled by centralised servers or group of servers. This issue here is the representation of value as the data can be altered, duplicated or completely removed. Therefore, puts the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data at risk. 

We know that blockchain technology aims to tackle these problems through decentralisation, the cryptography and consensus that secures the blockchain which allows data to be secured and unaltered, this removes that single point of failure through the current system of centralisation. 

Smart contracts takes blockchain technology a step further by allowing the ability to securely have ownership of an asset of value. This value could be in the form of currencies or a digital representation of important documents, voting and much more, this concept allows ownership to be truly verified and tracked knowing it’s unique and unaltered. So let’s dig deeper into what smart contracts actually are. 

WHAT IS A SMART CONTRACT 

In simple terms, a smart contract is a digital representation of a real world contract. The contract is determined by a pre-existing set of rules and conditions. Smart contracts allows the ability to complete complexed transactions in an automated and decentralised manner. The word smart contract was initially created by Nick Szabo ([brief bio](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/people/nick-szabo)

A simple example would be if I was selling a house. I would need the ability to store the deed to my house and I would need a way for an individual to buy it and transfer the price for it. In the traditional world this can take ages due to the reliance of third party entities involved and can cost more through unnecessary fees and the outcome can vary greatly due to unknown variables. However, the smart contract in this concept would accept the deed, allow someone to purchase it and once purchased would transfer the deed from the smart contract to the recipients account. Then it would release all the funds was the deed is sold to my account all in an automated, speedier, deterministic and decentralised process. These types of advanced transactions go beyond just simple P2P transactions and require complex data structures within the code such as loops and more. In the case of Ethereum the smart contract orientated programming language is called Solidity and is where many of our favourite and popular Dapps started. Alternative use cases for smart contracts can be event based insurance, IOT, funding, lending and so much more. Smart contracts also have the ability to call other smart contracts which creates a convenient and simplified system. Therefore, contracts are the fundamental building blocks of decentralised applications and have the ability to remove third party entities through an automated process. 

HOW DO THEY WORK 

Smart contracts are stored within the blockchain, therefore are both immutable and distributed. Immutable meaning once it’s created and deployed it cannot be changed and distributed due to the fact the smart contract output is verified through the consensus mechanism of the blockchain. The only issue in terms of trust would be from external sources such as real world data which is minimised by the reliance on oracle networking to provide reliable and correct data. The smart contract is written in a programming language specified by the blockchain it’s on (as mentioned, Solidity for Ethereum). Depending on the use case of the smart contract, variables and conditions will be written into the program. Some examples of smart contract which are used continuously is defi such as the creation of algorithmic stablecoins, smart contracts for providing liquidity or crowdfunding that will only unlock funds once conditions are met and can be verified by anyone. 

Smart contracts essentially allow a permissionless, decentralised and more powerful way of conducting business in various sectors and in the future will have a limitless amount of use cases. 

SMART CONTRACT RISKS 

The most obvious and most common risk that plagues any form of source code is coding flaws and bugs. This can lead to a compromised smart contracts being used for malicious purposes. Probably the most notable smart contract exploit was the DAO hack [here](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao#section-the-dao-hack). This emphasises the importance of why all code including smart contracts must go through a thorough and rigorous integrity audits and through a verification process. 

Alternative issues could be from blockchain upgrades that may lead to unforeseen behaviour or oracle services being unable to interpret real world data.

TLDR: Smart contracts are a digital representation of a real world contract created with pre-existing conditions to transact and store value on the blockchain."

# General Conclusion

Governance tokens emerged thanks to the birth of famous DeFi projects such as MakerDAO, Compound, Aave, Uniswap, etc., which have seen growth in marketcap skyrocket since DeFi Summer 2020.

In today's article, we will discuss what governance tokens are, how they impact the DeFi space, and why they are valuable.

# What Is A Governance Token?

&gt;A governance token is a type of token that grants voting rights to their owners in a particular protocol.

There are currently two ways to calculate the power of voting for governance tokens: token-weighted voting (almost protocols) and time-weighted voting (e.g. Curve).

Voting power is weighted according to the number of tokens, which means that the more governance tokens a holer holds, the more decision-making weight they have on an issue. While time-weighted voting rights give more rights to those who lock the governance token for longer.

## Off-Chain Governance

In off-chain governance, network participants communicate outside of the network. These mechanisms can be used to grant token holders informal voting rights. Votes can signal the community to download the code change, but **votes do not automatically trigger the change**. If a minority disagrees, they can choose not to download the code update. This will result in two separate networks (hard fork).

## On-Chain Governance

With on-chain governance, **code changes are done automatically once voting is complete**. Similar to off-chain governance, a minority can choose a minority group can choose to create a hard fork with the new changes.

The main difference between the two governances is in the way in which participants choose to participate. The on-chain governance allows the code change to occur by majority vote, while the off-chain governance requires participants to download the code change.

&gt;As an open-source network, each scenario presents an opportunity for the minority to create a network that works for them.

For example, we have seen many forked platforms like Sushiswap from Uniswap, Swerve from Curve or Mirror from Synthetix. Basically, these fork platforms either compete directly with the original platform (Swerve) or go in a new direction compared to the original platform (SushiSwap, Mirror).

Governance tokens allow holders to vote for changes in the network to which they belong. Usually, the number of tokens a person holds is proportional to the power of votes they have.

# Governance Token Impact On DeFi

For many in the crypto space, governance tokens are a key function of the DeFi protocol that enables decentralised voting. This approach is consistent with the financial decentralisation that the system hopes to achieve.

The principles of DeFi focus on financial democracy:

* The ability for all users to participate; and
* Have a voice in a monetary system that works in favor of the majority.

Looking back in history, we have seen a change in governance in protocols like MakerDAO and Synthetix. In March 2020 MakerDAO completed its transition to complete community governance.

# General Conclusion

Governance tokens emerged thanks to the birth of famous DeFi projects such as MakerDAO, Compound, Aave, Uniswap, etc., which have seen growth in marketcap skyrocket since DeFi Summer 2020.

In today's article, we will discuss what governance tokens are, how they impact the DeFi space, and why they are valuable.

# What Is A Governance Token?

&gt;A governance token is a type of token that grants voting rights to their owners in a particular protocol.

There are currently two ways to calculate the power of voting for governance tokens: token-weighted voting (almost protocols) and time-weighted voting (e.g. Curve).

Voting power is weighted according to the number of tokens, which means that the more governance tokens a holer holds, the more decision-making weight they have on an issue. While time-weighted voting rights give more rights to those who lock the governance token for longer.

## Off-Chain Governance

In off-chain governance, network participants communicate outside of the network. These mechanisms can be used to grant token holders informal voting rights. Votes can signal the community to download the code change, but **votes do not automatically trigger the change**. If a minority disagrees, they can choose not to download the code update. This will result in two separate networks (hard fork).

## On-Chain Governance

With on-chain governance, **code changes are done automatically once voting is complete**. Similar to off-chain governance, a minority can choose a minority group can choose to create a hard fork with the new changes.

The main difference between the two governances is in the way in which participants choose to participate. The on-chain governance allows the code change to occur by majority vote, while the off-chain governance requires participants to download the code change.

&gt;As an open-source network, each scenario presents an opportunity for the minority to create a network that works for them.

For example, we have seen many forked platforms like Sushiswap from Uniswap, Swerve from Curve or Mirror from Synthetix. Basically, these fork platforms either compete directly with the original platform (Swerve) or go in a new direction compared to the original platform (SushiSwap, Mirror).

Governance tokens allow holders to vote for changes in the network to which they belong. Usually, the number of tokens a person holds is proportional to the power of votes they have.

# Governance Token Impact On DeFi

For many in the crypto space, governance tokens are a key function of the DeFi protocol that enables decentralised voting. This approach is consistent with the financial decentralisation that the system hopes to achieve.

The principles of DeFi focus on financial democracy:

* The ability for all users to participate; and
* Have a voice in a monetary system that works in favor of the majority.

Looking back in history, we have seen a change in governance in protocols like MakerDAO and Synthetix. In March 2020 MakerDAO completed its transition to complete community governance. In the course of 2020 Synthetix launched several DAOs, with each DAO managing separate parts of the protocol created by the main developers.

# 3.BakerDAO Ecological Progress

BakerDAO ecology is continuing to advance, and cooperation is welcome.

**About BakerDAO:** 

BakerDAO is an upgrade MakerDAO protocol on Binance Smart Chain(BSC). It is a multi-collateral stablecoin borrow system on BSC, which allow users to generate decentralized stablecoin BAI by leveraging collateral assets like BNB, BUSD, ETH, BTC and so on. Excess collateral, self-balance system, liquidators and other ecosystem participants ensure that 1 BAI is soft-pegged to 1 USD. BKR is the decentralized governance token of BakerDAO, and its holders can use it to initiate proposals and vote to govern the major events or decide development directions for BakerDAO."

* Will have lower collateral ratio (CR)
* Lower CR allows for higher leverage
* Lower CR means more margin for liquidation
* This is made possible by the B.AMM design of B.Protocol v2

For comparison's sake, last month, on this day, (July 11th), we had a price of .05425; and it felt like we fluctuated between the fives forEEEEVEEEEEER; and then, a few more days after forEEEEEVEEEEER, when we moved to .06? The world joined us to .09.  
Two months ago, on this day, June 11th, we had a price of .0618, and we were skyrocketing up towards our ath of .12X. Many of you were not here back then. Once the world saw us past .07, they joined us.   
I invite folks to reshape their thinking.   
(This is not financial advice) It takes us very little momentum, to get the world to look at us. We're so small in our price. That if we go up even one cent, we become a top mover with potential to gain 10more in an hours or less time.   
I invite folks to reshape their thinking; and see .06 as our default.   
If we ever, god forbid, fall to .03;  
know; the core base here; us 26.4k reddit potential holders of around 34.5k total potential hodl holders. (not financial advice) can try bringing it back up to .06. and if it ever goes past .07? wherever our new floor becomes after the world spins our fate's wheel.   
Find comfort in these days.   
Find comfort eating 6s in the morning.  
6s at noon.  
6s in the evening.  
Find comfort knowing, once upon a time, just a month ago; we were eating nothing but 5s for what felt like weeks. just stacking. and then? just like that? our whole floor raised a level.  
Find comfort knowing, once upon a time, just two months ago; we were just trying to beat our previous all time high of .07x. and when we finally went from .03 to .07; the world took us to a new high of .12x.   
.07, the world looks at us.  
.06, we eat dip &amp; stake baby. 

There's a new Cryptocurrency Exchange opening up in India called CoinDCX. i invite my fellow Ampians sometime today to tweet at them or message them and invite them to adopt AMP as a crypto on their opening year.   
A potential billion indians seeing AMP as a potential buy might be pretty tight. 

For Today, i offer everyone, what news AMP (and AMP related) has been found within, over the month of August. Ill do this again when we hit another major milestone, \[this one in particular because we hit 34,500+) for those that like to read about AMP related news. one after the other after the other. (Some of it will look like its talking about SHIB, but those are mainly amazon related news articles that talked about both SHIB and AMP). If you have news sources you like to get your AMP Related News from anywhere; feel free letting me know!  


I love hearing where people learn about their crypto and am always down for new friends, pardon my slow replies tho; i just use reddit for my version of fun &lt;3

Dear SubDAO community,

The SubDAO official team is glad to see there are so many participants in our “Do Your Own DAO” event. All participants have shown a rich knowledge about the DAO and submitted a good answer on our test. Here is the answer to the doubt when you answer our question. Search for the correct answer right now!

#### 1. How to define DAO from the perspective of sociology？ 

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an organization whose essential operations are automated, agreeing to rules and principles assigned in code without human involvement. 

A DAO is a novel, scalable, self-organizing coordination on the blockchain, controlled by smart contracts”. In short, a DAO can be defined as people with common goals that join under a blockchain infrastructure that enforces a set of shared rules. DAO activity is recorded in the blockchain and, as a result, implies a cost. Validating and confirming transactions on the Ethereum blockchain requires a certain amount of work, called gas (paid in crypto-currency). This work is performed by blockchain miners in order to include transactions in a block. Gas ultimately translates into money and the amount of gas depends on the size and type of each transaction. As a result, it is expected that DAO activity is conditioned by this since users are required to pay small amounts of cryptocurrency if they want their operation to be executed. 

We can consider two kinds of DAOs, those built from scratch, and those created from a template provided by a DAO platform, i.e. DAOs as a service. In the first type, the members are usually developers who have specialized knowledge to create and manage them. Both types are described below. DAO is not only a sociological concept, but also a paradigm of organizational relations, even becoming a buzzword when breaking the circle in the encrypted world. Bitcoin itself can be understood as the earliest DAO. 

After 12 years of growth, DAO, like all collaborations, will produce the division of labor and development of participants, and it is necessary to follow the context of DAO to look at its future.

#### 2. What is the roadmap of DAO development? 

The development of DAO and the development of the crypto market are following each other. In the pre-Ethereum era, DAO is embodied as Bitcoin’s on-chain consensus and community governance. With the diversification of the underlying public chain, here is the first differentiation of DAO implementation methods. 

The formulaic negotiation model of off-chain proposals represented by BIP provides continuous support for network upgrades, but there are still disputes over development efficiency and on-chain execution. Some communities believe that more events should occur on the chain, and Decred has appeared. And Tezos and other chains automatically execute the upgraded governance logic. 

In Dash, DashDAO, a node specifically responsible for governance, was created. After Ethereum went online, there was a watershed event “The DAO”, the earliest financing DAO project, which culminated in the successful raising of US$150 million and ended with the theft of funds. Although the project fell quickly, the model of “creative projects obtained financing from the community, DAO token holders and future benefits” remained and became the basic logic of the current popular venture DAO. 

Moloch, the prototype of the financing DAO, inherits this logic in its concise functional design. The development decisions of the underlying technology may be more concentrated among crypto enthusiasts and geeks, and the scope of participation in governance cannot be expanded, so governance can only be the self-entertainment of a few people. Encrypted users start to participate in governance extensively and personally, often starting from the application layer. 

MakerDAO is not only the originator of DeFi but also the beginning of the practicality of DAO. This kind of application layer protocol directly facing end-users makes people truly feel the rights they enjoy as currency holders. Before DeFi formed a prairie fire in 2019, due to the relatively concentrated economic distribution of tokens for most projects, and the limited capital and user scale, voting governance had not yet become a normal operation for crypto players. And some visionary practitioners recognize that DAO, as the prerequisite for the organization of the crypto world, is an essential requirement for any community-based organization. 

The DAO service platform represented by Aragon (2016) and DAOstack (2018) has provided DAO tools for thousands of community projects and has deposited hundreds of millions of dollars in governance. According to incomplete statistics, the number of DAO participants has exceeded 60,000 addresses, which has increased more than 60 times from 10,000 at the beginning of last year.

With the rapid development of the scale of the encryption industry and the refinement of services, DAO is also evolving rapidly. While Ehereum’s ecosystem of competitors is developing rapidly, its organizational paradigm is also seeking innovation. Polkadot adopts the mode of the timely upgrade of on-chain governance at the protocol layer, and the multi-chain architecture also provides new development soil for DAO. 

Different from Etetherem’s “strong application and weak protocol” status, rising stars like Polkadot rely on powerful tool support to provide a silky development experience for the project to help the application to be implemented at a low cost and efficiency. In this environment, a strong infrastructure is a necessary guarantee for latecomer advantages. 

DAO is an essential component, and the value of its service platform is particularly precious. SubDAO came into being. It helps the Polkadot ecological project to create and manage DAO agilely and can become a solid middle platform for the entire ecosystem, further realizing the value capture of DAO.

#### 3. What is the specific application utility of DAO?

According to actual use cases, it is more widely present in all projects. There are relatively few decentralized communities on similar platforms DAOstack and Colony. What is interesting is that dozens of forked communities have been generated based on Moloch, which is the most common DAO model in financing. 

According to the scene classification of the application layer, we discuss the mechanism of DAO in the following environment. 

**1)Financing scenario** 

Purpose: To create a decentralized incubator for funding investment or grants to provide support for project development

Moloch Dao, Duckdao, Marketing Dao, DAOSquare, DAOX, DEPO

**Extended application: Initial DAO Offering**

In 2019, developers in the Ethereum community forked code to modify smart contracts to develop more complex DAO. MetaCartel Ventures and Marketing DAO, for example, are able to distribute and transfer shares and other assets among members. Since then, the for-profit DAO MetaCartel Ventures, which focuses on early investments in Ethereum projects, has raised nearly $24 million from its 64 members. 

DAOs like DUCKDAO and DAO Maker also run token public offerings. DAO Maker has even been approved by regulators in Malta. The project uses chain address analysis to find historical transactions to identify potential applicants for long-term token holders and to develop them into valuable community members.

**2)DeFi scene**

In the governance of each project of the application layer based on its business model, governance content is different, more representative of the following scenarios:

**The DAO module in DeFi**

Primarily used to decide key parameters in DeFi’s business in a decentralized manner, starting with MakerDAO, governance to Uniswap has become a landmark transaction for chain activities and is widely marked as a criterion for project screening of qualified users (e.g. for airdrops)

**Cross-chain liquidity DAO**

Represented by BadgerDAO, BoringDAO, and LidoDAO, it is designed to address the centralization of assets across chains.

**3)NFT encryption art scene**

DAO project focusing on investment and ecological construction of encrypted artworks. With the NFT boom (or bubble) peaking, the DAO that surrounds the NFT has also attracted attention.

**4) Service aggregation scenario**

The increase in project demand for DAAs, which specialize in providing developers and projects with easy-to-use standardized modules for integrated DAAs, will become standard in any blockchain ecosystem.

#### 4. What kind of governance is decentralized?

Concepts of decentralization have changed rapidly over the past quarter of a century in tandem with the evolution in thinking about governance. Until the early 1980s government and the state were generally perceived interchangeably. The government was seen as the institutional embodiment of state sovereignty and as the dominant source of political and legal decision-making. 

The use of blockchain as an infrastructure for governance has confronted two points of view. The ones who have a high degree of techno-determinism, who embed the idea of “market” in the made decisions or the way that an organization has to operate, however, they tend to ignore the complexity of social organizations. On the other side, the critical ones defend the role of traditional central authorities. They consider central authorities necessary to enable democratic governance. 

These views usually advocate regulating blockchain markets in order to reinforce the role of the state. Moreover, governance under blockchain is challenging, since it is difficult to steer a decentralized community and promote its development without sacrificing decentralization. The tool that has emerged to enable organizations to operate in the blockchain is DAO.

#### 5. How do we achieve “autonomy” with DAO?

Autonomy is dedicated to dealing with quantifiable transactions in DAO governance, such as development tasks, design work, financial processing accounting work, and so on. These transactions can usually be designed in advance to automate procedures. A good way to do this is Bounty. Bounty’s biggest advantage is standardization. We just need to design a perfect Bounty mechanism to handle different types of work. Bounty’s most important thing is “quantification”. As long as sufficient quantification is achieved, many tasks and tasks of DAO do not need to rely on communication or even communication. Generally speaking, if your DAO is a non-minimum feasible DAO, such as a product development team, or a decentralized company, then autonomy will definitely account for most of the workload of DAO governance.

#### 6. The advantage of DAO should be to reduce the cost of communication between people through automatically executed code, but why does it seem that we did not reduce the cost of communication, but higher?

DAO technology could help improve the agency relationship, but also proposed the potential of blockchain technology as an emerging technology of governance design, in which many ideal models and theoretical evaluations were limited by the real world. First of all, the blockchain is a fundamental technology, and its transformative impact will take decades rather than years to establish and reform the system. In the corporate governance environment, the application of blockchain technology may develop in the existing centralized structure or decentralized environment. 

The former requires consensus on how and when to implement such technologies for governance use cases. For the latter, only when a true decentralized common blockchain emerges, with scalability and full security, can the proxy relationships be truly removed to overhaul them? With the complexity of the agency relationship, human behavior in the agency relationship needs a backstop, namely the continuous support of the human code. Without decentralized human support for code, the immutability of the blockchain and its cryptography security systems may not create true transactional guarantees and trust between principals and agents to maintain the integrity of their contractual relationships.

The blockchain-based corporate governance solution in DAO requires an incremental blockchain governance protocol. Thus, the socially optimal hard fork rule may not be applicable. Today, many companies are investing resources to develop and implement blockchain-based programs. In traditional contract governance, the effectiveness of contract management cooperation depends on the quality of the national legal system to a large extent. 

Conversely, DAO governance does not directly depend on the enforceability of external legal systems. Enforcement in a blockchain is achieved through prescribed code and algorithms, such as smart contracts. Even more, in governance, direct connections between collaborators are not required in a blockchain. Thus, blockchain may be considered the first form of governance that truly leverages digital technology’s computational- and data-based capabilities, well beyond traditional forms of social governance. DAO, like other governance mechanisms, does not govern all types of transactions equally well. DAO governance can reduce searching, monitoring, and enforcement costs but tends, but often means relatively high design costs.

#### 7. I want to use DAO to complete the development of a product, how do I manage the project? 

This is the aim SubDAO wants to realize. SubDAO is primarily a tool for creating and managing DAOs for DeFi and NFT applications, helping applications to create and manage DAOs more quickly. 

Today, the governance approach of DAO has evolved into the organizational framework of DeFi projects today. As we progress further, we expect more projects to use governance like DAO. There are now some DAOs on the blockchain, and most DAOs have their own governance scenarios and systems, such as MakerDAO, TheLAO, etc., that develop their own systems for governance. Other organizations have developed basic chains of DAO governance tools, such as Aragon. 

As more and more applications become available, we will find that the development of DAO governance tools is not convenient for every application, only those organizations with sufficient research and development strength or sufficient initial capital reserves can afford the cost of building a DAO, but it is impossible for small organizations or organizations without capital reserves of their own research and development governance tools. In addition, current application requirements have the common needs of DAO, such as voting and money management, as a combination of multiple forms of decision-making, automated implementation of governance behavior, community day-to-day governance communications, etc. These demands are difficult to meet, while only some systems have open interfaces to customize personalized needs, and high requirements for personalized technical are very common. These conditions are almost impossible to achieve for small and medium-sized organizations. 

Enriching and refining the DAO governance toolchain as much as possible is the foundation for the DAO’s sustainable development, and allowing users to participate in the governance and expansion of the DAO as easily as possible is the way to enable the DAO to present a variety of approaches. SubDAO was born for this purpose as Polkadot’s DAO infrastructure to provide all DAO users with the tools they need for governance, while SubDAO also owns cross-chain capabilities to enable multi-asset management, enabling DAO organizations to manage and precipitate funds to maximize returns.

#### 8. Is the DAO the final governance model? 

DAOs are particularly conditioned by the idiosyncrasies of the blockchain technology, which is decentralized and serverless, with immutable records, and where operations imply a cost. Furthermore, despite being in their infancy, these sociotechnical systems are already facing problems that may relate to those that affect other socio-technical systems and are already studied in the literature. 

Thus, we believe DAOs deserve interdisciplinary research attention to ascertain whether their problems are similar or not to those from other online and offline alternatives. Furthermore, to determine whether they provide an effective means for running a decentralized organization, or they only work under certain conditions, for example, when voters are known and the topics are limited in scope. 

* DAOs are no gatherings of smart contracts, but socio-technical ecosystems consisting of mutually dependent parties. Organizational processes are thereby increasingly ingrained and enacted on-chain, blurring the division between systems and organizations. 
* Even though motivated by strong enthusiasm, funds, and beliefs, DAOs face several inhibitors to decentralization and autonomy; it remains interesting, why these projects have not originated generativity, yet. One could argue that these DAOs may become the victims of their financial successes where, instead of experimenting freely on a large scale, legal issues or public feuds take center stage. 
* Human intervention in DAOs is being displaced, transformed, but not marginalized. Instead of achieving autonomy, our DAOs showed the reliance on several central actors acting as gatekeepers, administrate funds, or accumulating expertise, which reintroduces trust into a system, which was repeatedly considered trust-free. 
* Shortcomings of “Code is law” are met with “Code is Constitution”, where our studied DAOs show mechanisms to change fundamental processes when the need arises. As a consequence, blockchain’s immutability, one of its core characteristics, is questioned. 
* DAOs need to invest heavily up-front in governance structures, while their infrastructures find limited use, which draws similarities from studies on the Internet and their bootstrap problem. Without considering infrastructure in practice, these upfront costs pass unseen, while only promises of more efficient transactions through smart contracts are highly applied.

#### 9. How will DAO develop in the future? 

DAOs are coordinated by consensus mechanisms. Thus, DAOs are different from markets coordinated by the price mechanism, hierarchies coordinated by fiat, or networks coordinated by social relations. How should one make sense of DAOs? DAOs are not governed by principal-agent relationships, since they do not have shareholders or managers. Because they do not rely on fiat or hierarchies and operate transparently using public blockchains and open-source software, they are, to some extent, immune to the issues of opportunism and information asymmetry. And because they operate with little human coordination and do not incur costs for monitoring employees, they may behave in ways that traditional perspectives in organizational economics are ill-equipped to capture. 

In particular, the growth of DAOs is likely not bound by increases in the marginal cost of organizing (because DAOs are not hierarchies), and the cost of conducting additional transactions within DAOs can theoretically decrease with size owing to positive network externalities. Thus, at this stage, the scholarly community may lack the theoretical tools needed to understand either the growth of DAOs or, more generally speaking, what determines the boundaries of such organizations. The present study only begins to tackle this problem.

#### 10. Is DAO An Alternative to the Public Corporation? 

There are fewer than half as many public corporations today as there were fifteen years ago. The public corporation in the US is now unnecessary for production. Meanwhile, over the last few months, over 150 DAOs have gone public through initial coin offerings, a public sale through which the general public can acquire, early on, cryptocurrency tokens to support the development of the organization. While the number of public corporations is dwindling — there are 37 percent fewer today than there were in 1997 — DAOs are on the rise. 

Outside the payments sector, DAOs are providing new solutions for supply-chain management in the luxury goods industry, record-keeping in trade finance, trusted-identity provision in online environments, and patient-history management in the healthcare sector. What these industries have in common is that their business activities are prone to moral hazards and behavioral uncertainty. As a result, expensive intermediaries are heavily relied upon to provide trust to the interacting parties. Going forward, DAOs may be able to provide competitive alternatives for organizing in those sectors. 

More than 30 years ago, Rothschild and Whitt identified factors that should lead to the development of “collective organizations.” These included the demystification of knowledge, defined as the process whereby “formerly exclusive, obscure, or esoteric bodies of knowledge are simplified, explicated, and made available to the membership at large”. By publishing all software related to the blockchain, protocol, and peer-to-network in an open-source format, DAOs are well on track to achieve this demystification. 

At a theoretical level, the shift from the public corporation to the DAO may be a radical one, and this research represents a first attempt at exploring its implications from the viewpoint of organizational scholarship. The organizational and management scholars will pay attention to these developments that are currently changing the face of the heavily intermediated form of capitalism that has prevailed in our economies since the seventeenth century.

**About SubDAO**

SubDAO is a DAO infrastructure based on Polkadot, where any decentralized organization is allowed to conveniently create and manage a DAO. SubDAO does not only connect DAO with DApps to realize DAO’s cross-chain management but also bridges Web 2.0 and Web 3.0.

The founding team of SubDAO is composed of the former Technical Team leader of the IBM Group and many early well-known developers from Polkadot. All team members own rich experiences in Internet companies such as IBM, Tencent, and Alibaba. Jack Platts, former Director of External Cooperation of the Web3 Foundation and Partner of Hypersphere Ventures, serves as a strategic contributor to SubDAO. So far SubDAO has completed multi-million dollar financing including Hypersphere, Huobi Ventures, and other institutions.

### Introduction

Since the *BakerDAO System Upgrade Scheme V1.0* (https://docs.bakerfi.com/bakerdao/system-upgrade-scheme) took shape, the team has begun to design the system and conduct feasibility verification. As the contract involves many innovations, the team has to be very cautious during the development, and after completion, the contract audit must be performed before the launch. This article will reveal the development plan of the scheme and the system design of the first launch.

### Glossary

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uf6aauu46pg71.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85ef14e43c59b1c7e903a3981753fcaa642c065d

 

### Problems

Based on Ethereum’s MakerDAO, BakerDAO has optimized the economic model, hoping to generate another decentralized stablecoin in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and realize billions of U.S. dollars in BAI circulation, hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in annual income and billions of U.S. dollars in market value. At the initiation phase, in order to realize the decentralization of BKR, BakerDAO launched liquidity mining since June 19th, 2021, and BAI price fluctuated less than 1 U.S. dollar the next day. After that, all liquidity mining activities related to BAI limited partner (LP) were immediately suspended to prevent speculation for BAI arbitrage. Later, the market was tumbling, which caused three problems in the system, namely, collateral liquidation, instability of BAI, and BKR price decline. These problems during the execution of the project should be tackled by innovative solutions. This project mainly aims to stabilize BAI at 1 U.S. dollar, and more ecologies could support the application of BAI. The problems and solutions are elaborated as follows.

### Launch plan and system design

To address the above problems, the team released the *BakerDAO System Upgrade Scheme V1.0* last month and received widespread acclaim from the community. At the same time, the team conducted a preliminary feasibility analysis and demo. After thoughtful consideration and discussion, we decided to use three versions to launch the content of the upgrade scheme in stages. The detailed plan is as follows:

►V0.9: to be launched in September 2021, including liquidation module optimization, BAI liquidation pool, BAI stabilization pool, DAO pool, and liquidity mining; optimization and development of the next version will be carried out in Q4 2021;

►V1.0: to be launched in Q1 2022, including open Vault and repurchase program;

► Aggregation platform: to be launched in Q2 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1kpclf4e6pg71.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b10d44bb3696d2b0100279c00d25cd54029b6ff

 

This document mainly provides a detailed description of the V0.9 version that will be launched in September 2021. The goal of V0.9 is to build BakerDAO from a simple stablecoin issuance protocol to a MakerDAO +Liquidity+ Curve complex to ensure the stability and liquidity of BAI and the stability of BKR, and to initially anchor BAI at USD 1. This will form the foundation to build a BAI ecosystem. After that, we will consider the deployment of multiple chains to realize a prosperous multi-chain BAI ecosystem.

#### 1. Liquidation module optimization

This version will optimize the clearing module, improve some parameters and restrictions in the clearing, to solve the problems in the previous clearing process, and let the community share the benefits:

a) Adjust the BUSD mortgage rate. The 101% mortgage rate means that the upper limit of the BAI price is expected to be $1.01, and it is easy to give up the mortgage assets and short BAI;

b) Increase the liquidation price limit, do not allow low-price liquidation, and ensure that the system has no deficit caused by liquidation;

c) Increase the restrictions on clearing participants, and only allow the clearing pool (explained in detail later) to participate in the clearing and withdraw the clearing right;

d) The liquidation income is shared, and the liquidation income will be distributed to the liquidation pool and the project team in a ratio of 7:3;

e) Shorten the clearing cycle to 2 minutes and improve the clearing efficiency;

f) Adjust the stable rate in a timely manner. Increasing the stable rate will reduce the supply of BAI, which will help the price of BAI. After the price of BAI stabilizes to $1, the stable rate will be reduced to increase the supply of BAI and lower the expected price of BAI;

g) Adjust the upper limit of the BAI obtained by the collateral, control the amount of BAI that the collateral can produce, and control the price of BAI by controlling the supply of BAI.

#### 2. BAI liquidation pool

The BAI liquidation pool system is designed to encourage more holders to mortgage to generate BAI, keep the stability of BAI and reflect the value of BAI, which allows holders to mortgage BAI to obtain liquidation income,and participate in BKR farming:

► Users uses the collateral to borrow BAI from the Borrow system;

► Users mortgages BAI to the liquidation pool, shares the system liquidation proceeds, and obtains LP: LBAI

► Users can pledge LBAI to the liquidity mining pool to receive LBKR rewards, and LBKR holders will share the DAO pool rewards.

► The system withdraws the liquidation right through the above-mentioned fixed addresses, and the liquidation pool shares 70% of the liquidation income according to the different proportion of BAI deposited;

► The rewarded LBKR can be unlocked after a period of time into BKR in the DAO pool, but the user will no longer receive the DAO pool rewards after unlocking.

#### 3. BAI stabilization pool

In order to improve the liquidity of BAI and ensure the stability of BAI, when the value of BAI deviates from 1 U.S. dollar, users can arbitrage to keep BAI anchored at 1 U.S. dollar. The BAI stable pool is specially designed, which can also be called BAI hard anchoring system. , This pool allows users to trade BAI and other stablecoin assets with a lower slippage and a smoother curve. The initial stablecoin support: BAI, BUSD, and USDT.

► The liquidity provider provides BAI, BUSD, USDT as pools, and obtains LP: SBAI;

► Liquidity providers can pledge SBAI to the liquidity mining pool to receive LBKR rewards, and LBKR holders will share the DAO pool rewards;

► Users can buy and sell BAI for arbitrage when the price of BAI deviates from $1

► Liquidity providers can get a 60% reward of transaction fees;

► The rewarded LBKR can be unlocked after a period of time into BKR in the DAO pool, but the user will no longer receive the DAO pool rewards after unlocking.

#### 6. DAO Pool

In order to better reflect the value of BKR, make more community users willing to hold BKR for a long time, and contribute to the development of BakerDAO, it is planned to share 40% of the system revenue with BKR holders, and the remaining system revenue will be used to maintain System stability, specially designed DAO pool, can also be called BKR pledge pool:

► The user locks BKR to the DAO pool, and obtains different amounts of locked BKR according to the lock duration: LBKR;

► The DAO pool will reward 40% of the system stability fee income according to the proportion of users holding LBKR;

► The LBKR rewarded by other pools is equivalent to the BKR that the user has locked in the DAO pool and is entitled to the same rewards;

► The LBKR can be unlocked after a period of time into BKR in the DAO pool, but the user will no longer receive the DAO pool rewards after unlocking.

To better understand the design logic of V0.9, see the following two diagrams:

An Unexpectedly Happy Ending To A Liquidated CDP: Both A Story &amp; Heads Up,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/p2uf5w/an_unexpectedly_happy_ending_to_a_liquidated_cdp/,KingKoopa7574,1,2021-08-12 14:43:16,27,/r/ethfinance/comments/p2uf5w/an_unexpectedly_happy_ending_to_a_liquidated_cdp/,Technology,"Hey Community,

I've been in the space since 2017. I have a degree in computer science and thought I reasonably understood Ethereum and the ecosystem but something that happened yesterday totally caught me off guard (in a happy way). I'm making this post for the benefit of anyone who is layman enough (like me) who might accidentally discover a windfall after reading this post.

Turn the clocks back to 2019. I was a cocky idiot who thought ETH is going nowhere but up. So I created a CDP, filled it up with cheap ETH. Expecting the price to rise, I drew more and more DAI from the CDP, used it to buy ETH and deposited the ETH back as collateral - only to draw more DAI, rinse and repeat.

You can see where this is going. After I accumulated a large chunk of ETH in the CDP as collateral, I got liquidated when ETH dropped like a brick. Disheartened, I swore to never play with CDPs ever again (I had had a CDP liquidated for the same reasons in 2018 as well). It was painful - all that ETH - gone. I'm not going to say how much, because of opsec.

Fast forward to yesterday. I still have a long term hold ETH stack, and because my fiancèe and I are looking to close a deal on our dream house. So I thought I'd open a CDP to borrow against my position (but this time with massive overcollateralization).

So I went to DefiSaver and connected my wallet again, ready to put in some collateral.

That's when I see a message on the dashboard:

*""You have unclaimed collateral. This has most likely happened due to your CDP being liquidated. Claim it to return it to your CDP.""*

Huh?

I clicked through to that message, and lo and behold:

A big chunk of ETH lying somewhere in there as ""unclaimed collateral"". Can't say how much again here, exactly, but it was the five figure range $USD wise. Hands shaking, mouth dry, can't believe it.

Paid a few bucks as transaction fees and boom, money put away comfortably toward our house.

What was so weird for me was that I couldn't see the ""unclaimed collateral"" anywhere. Not on Etherscan, not on Zerion, etc etc. It was literally invisible magic money.

Long story short - if you're a degen like me and have CDPs liquidated in the past - check Defisaver, specifically this URL:

[https://app.defisaver.com/makerdao/manage](https://app.defisaver.com/makerdao/manage)

And hopefully you might find some ETH in there?

I've never won the lottery in my life, but this comes pretty close to what that must feel like.

Godspeed my friends. Let me know if any one uses this post to find any money tucked away they didn't know about."

Breaking traditional fund myths, DFC's imperial ambitions

DFC is a cross-chain decentralized financial platform created by the Tiffany Blockchain Foundation in Singapore. DFC is committed to solving the shortcomings of traditional finance, such as high cost, opaque information and complicated process, and providing users with a complete set of decentralized financial service system, such as decentralized transaction, lending and wealth management, cross-chain asset transaction and mining ecology.

&amp;#x200B;

DFC is about to restore financial order

Today we focus on DFC's Mining Ecology division, championed by Mr. Rajiv Kapoor, DFC's Chief Financial Officer. Rajiv Kapoor is from the United States with extensive influence in Europe, and has many years of experience in finance and trading with leading financial companies in the industry. He has also established four strong financial companies, how will he lead the DFC layout?

Rajiv Kapoor, chief financial adviser at DFC, was the first to come up with the idea of mining ecology. In his view, a mature economic model must have a variety of rewards. Just like playing a game and leveling up, the constant incentive for the user will continue to work. This is where DFC differs from general blockchain finance. Under the incentive system, DFC community will become an enthusiastic and active community, and users can show unprecedented vitality through mining ecology. This scene has also stimulated the development of the entire blockchain ecosystem. That's why Rajiv Kapoor created a mining ecology.

DFC lending acts like a mortgage in the traditional industry, except that cars and houses pledged to banks are exchanged for digital currency. The lender writes down the type and amount of its mortgage asset and chooses the amount it wants to lend, then creates a CDP, which is a written contract that specifies the type, amount and duration of the mortgage.

Rajiv Kapoor says mining ecology is an important part of DFC. In this area, users will get benefits that are usually hard to get. Mining ecology is also an important part of keeping DFC with active users. The introduction of a large amount of ecological flow will also gradually stabilize THE DFC project. By rewarding users for their contribution to the flow, the flow will be brought to the ecology and the start-up of the whole ecology will be promoted. Users can receive tokens as a reward when they complete the loan. Overall, the user's borrowing costs will be reduced to a low or even positive return, a win-win situation.

The release of DFC opened a ""Pandora's box"" under the ""borrow is dig"" game, which will push the popularity of DFC to another climax, even beyond MakerDAO. Help the platform capital pool to achieve prosperity and demand coexist, bring new hot spots and diversion points to the DeFi world, and rebuild a new future of financial order."

Breaking Down DeFi: Beginner's Guide,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p3ntri/breaking_down_defi_beginners_guide/,pbjclimbing,1,2021-08-13 23:54:39,7,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p3ntri/breaking_down_defi_beginners_guide/,EDUCATIONAL," We have all heard of DeFi and know that it stands for decentralized finance. It is a lot more complicated than it sounds. Below are several of the common DeFi applications (dapps). Many of them can be used independently, but some of them are often used in combination with each other. There are many many more than I am including. Some of the explanations are simplified and are meant to give a general gist, not be argued about the minutia.

# Borrowing and Lending 

This might seem straightforward and it can be, but a lot of the DeFi network is based off of leverage. People will put some assets down as collateral and then borrow a greater amount and user one of the methods below to have that money make them more money

**Compound** and **Aave** are two dapps that allow you to borrow and lend crypto assets. There is a spread between the borrowing and lending rates. 

# Decentralized Exchange Platforms 

Commenly called a DEX, decentralized exchange platforms, use automated market makers (AMM) to complete trades. A normal exchange has an order book where they have a list of what people will sell and buy a crypto for and then they match two together. AMMs have liquidity pools which consist of 2\* cryptos at a ratio to each other (called a pair). The balance between the 2 cryptos in the pair sets the ratio, which is essentially the exchange rate. If one is in more demand than the other then the balance will change which will change the price.

**Uniswap:** This is one of the most popular DEXes for ERC-20 tokens and very straight forward. Any user can set a liquidity pool between 2 tokens and earn a portion of the set spread (normally 0.6%). Uniswap how the majority of people buy an ERC-20 token that is not listed on an exchange/their exchange. Other DEXes that are similar to Uniswap include SushiSwap (ERC-20) and Pancake Swap (BEP-20)

**Balancer:** A more complicated version of Uniswap. Instead of just having liquidity pairs, Balancer has multi-token pools which can function like an index. The fees tend to be hire, but you can sometimes get a better rate than going through Uniswap, especially if there is not a direct pair between the tokens.

**Bancor:** Balancer is like a more complicated version of Uniswap and Bancor is less complicated, but tries to address ways that liquidity providers can lose money through impermanent loss, slippage, and involuntary exposure

**Curve Finance:** A low fee DEX that focuses on stablecoins

# Prediction

The DeFi market is filled with dapps that allow you to attempt to predict the market. They also have

**Augur:** Prediction market protocol that allows you to essentially bet on anything (might need a VPN some places).

**dYdX:** One of the larger decentralized margin trading platform that allows leverage.

# Staking

Staking is one of the core tenants of the DeFi network. You can stake a token and earn that token, or another token. You can also stake a liquidity token (essentially the proof that you have money in the liquidity pool).

**Yearn.Finance:** Yearn, finds the best way to stake your tokens using smart contracts, often resulting in a higher return. Very active community and governance.

# Synthetic/Wrapped Assets

Synthetic/wrapped assets are essentially a crypto that mimics something else. Either a 1:1 backing or smart contract allows a crypto to be traded on another chain (bitcoin on the ethereum blockchain). They can also allow other assets like stocks, indexes, commodities to be traded via the blockchain.

**Synthetix:** Allows the creation of synthetic assets like gold, stocks, fiats. The synthetic assets are backed by collateral locked into smart contracts

# Traditional Financial Services

**MakerDao:** A USD pegged stablecoin, DAI, backed by crypto collateral. This allows banking services and is one of the backbones of the DeFi world. USDC is backed 1:1 by USD in a bank account. Tether is backed by “trust us its good”.

**Nexus Mutual:** Provides cover/insurance for smart contracts. This is most commonly used for complex DeFi staking endeavors that have far greater returns than the cost, but involve many smart contracts which could all be a vulnerability.

# Conclusion

If you are not used to the DeFi space, this can all sound overwhelming. It is very easy to lose a lot of money in the DeFi space if you are unsure of what you are doing. Keep in mind that the higher the yield, frequently the higher the risk. Earning 80% APY on ETH will involve significant risk and depending on the protocol, you might not even know exactly what the risk is."

It has created a protocol permitting anyone with ETH and a MetaMask wallet to loan themselves money in the form of a stable coin referred to as “DAI.”

Here is the fresh news, Polygon has announced the integration of yield optimization vaults on the Maker Network and investing 50 million dollars of MATIC tokens from the treasury.

In other words, the protocol has now broadened in scope, vision, and transformation to become an Ethereum scaling aggregator typically allowing anyone to borrow money and reliably predict how much they had to pay back.

This for sure will ease the fear that used to come from crypto to crypto borrowing.

Similarly, there are few other networks opening vaults on polygon technology such as Beefy Finance.

I guess Polygon is elated, Don’t you think so?"
Why is there little to no talk about Axie Infinity here?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p3p0a6/why_is_there_little_to_no_talk_about_axie/,cannainform2,1,2021-08-14 00:47:46,56,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p3p0a6/why_is_there_little_to_no_talk_about_axie/,MEDIA,"There is so much progress and money being made with Axie Infinity I don't understand why no one one on r/cc is talking about it.

Take this article  [https://thedefiant.io/axie-infinity-revenue-beats-ethereum/?utm\_source=Iterable&amp;utm\_medium=email&amp;utm\_campaign=campaign\_2723610](https://thedefiant.io/axie-infinity-revenue-beats-ethereum/?utm_source=Iterable&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=campaign_2723610)

# Axie Infinity Has Beaten Even Ethereum in Network Fees Thanks to its Sidechain

 Facebook may be grabbing headlines with its talk about the metaverse as the basis for the company’s future, but blockchain game Axie Infinity already has a metaverse up and running and it’s grabbing something longer-lasting: revenue.

Protocol revenue on Axie Infinity yielded $305 million over the last 30 days, compared with $91.4 million for Ethereum, according to[ Token Terminal](https://www.tokenterminal.com/). That beats dominating a news cycle.

[Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) is a blockchain-enabled play-to-earn game run by the company [Sky Mavis](https://skymavis.com/). At first glance, it looks a lot like [Pokemon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/), but it also has a deckbuilding element reminiscent of Blizzard’s [Hearthstone](https://playhearthstone.com/) or Wizards of the Coast’s [Magic: the Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en).

“User growth and revenues are exploding,” Jeff Dorman, of the investment management firm [Arca](https://www.ar.ca/) said over Twitter DM. He said the fundamentals indicate investors are betting on much higher growth ahead for the ecosystem as well.

While the team behind it prioritizes making a high-quality game, really the feature that means the most to its users seems to be the fact that wealth generated by the game and its platform is driven back to them. Specifically, it’s provided a way for many players to earn a living for themselves in the form of crypto.

Right now, Axie is bringing in far more revenue than other more widely discussed projects, such as the stablecoin engine [MakerDAO](https://thedefiant.io/what-is-makerdao-and-how-does-dai-work/), the Binance Smart Chain automated market-maker [PancakeSwap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPNTYSpKoU) and even, the [Ethereum blockchain](https://thedefiant.io/eip-1559-economics/) itself.

Axie Infinity went from $100,000 in platform revenue in January 2021 to $196 million in July, Aleksander Leonard Larsen, Sky Mavis’ chief operating officer, told the Defiant.

“In the end it’s just kind of numbers on a screen,” he said. “It’s not like we take that money anyway. We put it in the treasury.”

Axie Infinity will eventually become a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO. It took the first step in that direction this year with the release of Axie Infinity Shards (AXS), the governance token that controls the aforementioned treasury. 

 Protocols by revenue can be found here: [https://www.tokenterminal.com/terminal/metrics/protocol\_revenue/cumulative](https://www.tokenterminal.com/terminal/metrics/protocol_revenue/cumulative)

The Axie Infinity project has been around since 2018, so why is it experiencing this jump now?

Sources The Defiant spoke to all attribute this success to one shift in particular: the launch of Sky Mavis’s[ Ronin sidechain](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/technology/ronin-ethereum-sidechain). Once the company moved players’ characters over to Ronin, the game became appreciably less expensive. In particular, players weren’t forking over expensive Ethereum gas fees to breed new Axies, the in-game characters users need to play.

“The fetters were removed. Then the word could spread and spark a fire,” Baronar, a community member who runs the[ Axie Chat](https://axiechat.com/) podcast told The Defiant over Discord. 

A sidechain is a separate blockchain built to interact with a main chain, such as Ethereum in Axie’s case, but with its own security model. Ronin was built specifically for the game. It first went live early this year, but Axies and their breeding were only able to run on it in late April. That’s when things started to change.

“Axie is a combination of not only the game but also the community aspect of it that surrounds it, and it’s also the economy,” Larsen said. 

#### No Transaction Fees

Once Axies lived on Ronin, players no longer lost a large portion of value to miners for logging breeding activity on chain. For now, Ronin has no transaction fees. That has lowered the barrier for so many players that the overall economy has grown dramatically.

AK is a community member who pioneered Axie sharing ([called scholarships](https://leveldash.com/axie-infinity-scholarship-guide/)) to the ecosystem. He said when Axies moved to Ronin in April, they saw a brief slump in Axie prices as a breeding uptick brought more Axies onto the market, but then once pent-up demand kicked in it started moving the value of the whole ecosystem back up. 

There are two kinds of revenue for the protocol right now: breeding fees (creating new Axie by pairing existing ones) and marketplace fees. Breeding fees in AXS all go to the treasury but the marketplace fees are in flux. Some of those may go to Sky Mavis at some point. Marketplace fees are just accumulating in a wallet right now.

#### More Play

By lowering the price to participate with Ronin, the team was making a key adjustment to the economy that unlocked a lot of activity, and at a certain point, that increased activity became a virtuous cycle.

After Ronin, players felt compelled to tell others about the game and drive even more activity, which made all the underlying Axie assets more valuable. There are several assets — a utility token called Smooth Love Potion (SLP), AXS, game real estate and in-game items, as well as the Axie NFTs.

Both of the tokens have been trending up lately. SLP hit a new all-time high on July 13 (at $0.3997) and AXS hit a new one yesterday, on August 11 (at $75.73).

Both are way up from mid-April, just before Ronin onboarded Axies, with SLP trading then at about $0.05 and AXS at generally just under $8.

The game is still in beta, so while its vision as a metaverse is much larger, now there are really two things players can do in the game: engage in battles with other players and go on solo quests to earn SLP.

The[ latest release](https://axie.substack.com/p/-axie-arena-season-18) of the game actually lowered the amount of rewards that players could accrue playing solo and increased rewards for playing against others, as a way to encourage everyone to focus on becoming better players rather than just gathering SLP. 

#### Bot Play

Solo play can be run by bot accounts, and Sky Mavis wants to eliminate as much bot-play as possible. Playing matches is a high skill activity, and at least for now, no one has built a machine that can do that well.

“There had been some issue with bots, and we’ve always been banning them,” Larsen said. With this latest change, he said it was like “moving from unskilled labor — that can be bots — to skilled labor.”

#### A Serious Living 

The play-to-earn model may be more serious than many Westerners realize. It’s actually feasible for people in many parts of the world to make a living[ playing Axie Infinity](https://thedefiant.io/nfts-are-becoming-a-major-source-of-income-for-crypto-newbies-in-the-philippines-to-colombia/). The more skill they build up at the game, the more they are able to earn.

“The goal was always to make a living playing the game and to own your own characters,” OhhShiny, an Axie community member told The Defiant. “It took a long time for people to understand.”

OhhShiny describes himself as a community manager for the metaverse, helping to onboard as many users as he can across the whole Axie ecosystem. He has the distinction of owning[ Galadriel](https://marketplace.axieinfinity.com/axie/991), potentially the single most valuable Axie.

Making meaningful income has become much easier for more players around the world as the value of SLP has gone up. The biggest roadblock is getting the in-game assets that allow a person to play, the Axies themselves.

#### Lending Axies

AK, the community member who created scholarships, has a large stable of Axies. For now, this is a fairly high-touch system that requires trust on both sides of a given loan. But it has proved lucrative enough that AK has gone full-time running scholarships, describing himself as a digital pet store operator.

Many of his earliest players have gone on to build their own guild of Axies and run scholarships of their own. Players using loaner Axies typically get to keep 60 to 65% of their earnings, while owners are able to put Axies to work that would have otherwise sat idle in their wallets.

To OhhShiny, it is difficult for those in the West to appreciate how significant it is in other parts of the world to be able to generate meaningful income by participating in an online ecosystem. If someone finds a way to earn money as readily as they can with Axie Infinity, he argued you basically have a responsibility to spread the word or you are a bad family member or neighbor.

“It has the highest co-efficiency of virality of anything that’s been invented on the internet before,” OhhShiny said. “I believe it has the potential to transform global labor markets.”

While Facebook is doing its press junkets, Axie Infinity looks like it could break a billion dollars in revenue this year."
"The Graph (GRT), also known as the ""Google of blockchain"", is the single most important piece of the blockchain puzzle.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p4lnff/the_graph_grt_also_known_as_the_google_of/,graph_marine,1,2021-08-15 10:58:44,92,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p4lnff/the_graph_grt_also_known_as_the_google_of/,FUN,"Think about a book - when you want to find a specific piece of information, you can either spend hours-days reading through the whole book to find it, or you can skip to the index and find it within seconds.

Before [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) ([GRT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/the-graph)) existed, developers who wanted to create decentralized apps needed to index all of Ethereum's data manually, a task which could take multiple developers months-years minimum to complete. The Graph indexes the previously unorganized blockchain data and makes it organized and easier for developers to create applications with.

Everytime a user is using a dApp (eg, Uniswap) to trade or view data, the dApp has to query The Graph for data. The Graph recently received up to 800 million daily queries in [May 2021](https://thegraph.com/blog/20billion-queries), with 20% growth monthly growth rate since launch in 2020.

Have you ever heard of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, Balancer, USDC, Synthetix, Sushiswap, MakerDAO, Yearn, Curve, or basically any of the popular dApps? They all functionally rely upon The Graph. A good representation of what The Graph is is when you use [info.uniswap.org](https://info.uniswap.org) \- all of this data comes from The Graph. Everytime you refresh, that's a query that Uniswap has to make to The Graph in order to provide you with up to data price data.

For the past 8+ months, dApps were getting this data for free, but soon they will migrate their subgraphs to the decentralized mainnet and be charged microfees per query. The query fees will be paid out amongst indexers (those who actually organize the data into subgraphs) and curators/delegators (those who stake/participants in the network). We are talking roughly $0.0001 or $0.00001 per query, so hundreds of millions of monthly capital flowing through The Graph and its participants.

Currently, there are 10-15 layer 1 blockchain networks (Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Polygon, and others) and hundreds of popular dApps (those listed above, and [more](https://thegraph.com/legacy-explorer/)) using The Graph. Several, like [Solana](https://solana.com/ecosystem/thegraph), asked The Graph to index their chain - they approached The Graph, not the other way around. However, in the future, there will be thousands of blockchain networks indexed by The Graph, millions of dApps/subgraphs, and trillions of daily queries. Imagine everyone using their phone to transact, refresh, and interact with media/applications that require data from The Graph.

When GRT launched, it was released on Kraken, Coinbase, and Binance on day 1 - no other coin in history has had this red carpet rollout, and there is good reason for it. All of these exchanges had [info pages](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-the-graph-grt) written for The Graph, where they referred to it as the ""Google of blockchain"".

The Graph is like a combination of decentralized versions of Google, banking, all of social media, all other service providers and other industries, all in one."

However, there finally seems to be a light hope. Yes, SheeshaFinance. 

I found this project while browsing through the #DeFi ecosystem to spot the latest gem. But my search ended abruptly. Why? 

It turns out SheeshaFinance is the gateway to investing in multiple DeFi startups at once. It uses the traditional concept of Mutual Funds. 

But aside that, SheeshaFinance also rewards it users with tokens from the partner projects within its pools. You only need to be a token holder. Interestingly, there are only 80k  #Sheesha tokens in circulation. Sounds like a fairytale right?

At present, the DeFi ecosystem based on Ethereum is the mainstream of decentralized finance. It is widely known for its most abundant applications and the largest amount of deposits. It can be said that thanks to the large-scale development of DeFi, ethereum public chain has ushered in the second spring after the release boom of Ethereum, and become the most ecological and active public chain on the chain. At the same time, however, the DeFi ecosystem continues to expose problems due to the limitations of Ethereum. In fact, Ethereum is also actively preparing to upgrade the system, but because the upper structure has been built, the underlying infrastructure improvement is difficult, it is difficult to fundamentally improve the status quo in the short term. DFC, a decentralised financial platform with strong technological advantages, is trying to change this. The model of DFC is an integrated and integrated DeFi platform, completely different from the decentralized DeFi ecosystem of Ethereum. This efficient and convenient decentralized financial model will represent the future development direction of DeFi.

With the popularity of various public chains and the emergence of a large number of on-chain tokens, the management of digital assets has become an urgent problem to be solved. The emergence of DeFi to a large extent to meet the needs of people's on-chain transactions, more importantly, DeFi for the traditional financial industry to provide a new solution. It can be said that 2019 is the first year of DeFi, and the DeFi ecosystem on mainstream public chains such as Ethereum and EOS has gradually developed. Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem is the fastest growing, largest, and most representative.

Despite its rapid development, DeFi is still unable to replace some centralized financial services facilities due to technical limitations. Decentralised switches (DEX), for example, are no match for centralised ones. The speed with which a decentralized exchange processes orders depends on the efficiency of the public chain. In addition, decentralised exchanges lack depth and volumes are small enough to handle large trades. Therefore, DFC hopes to solve various application problems faced by DeFi by constructing a DeFi financial ecology with more optimized mechanism and more complete ecology.

An important prerequisite for the development of stablecoins is to provide a reference system for the value of fiat currencies. In ethereum's DeFi ecosystem, MakerDAO solves this problem by proposing a mechanism to generate decentralized stablecoin DAI through token over-collateral. It also spawned applications for lending, leveraged trading, insurance, payments and many other games. However, DAI's lending rates lack stability. When the market was hot and loan demand was leveraged, MakerDAO had to organize a vote to raise the loan rate to stabilize the risk. Instead, mainstream money markets fall and interest rates will follow. The frequent fluctuation of interest rate leads to the instability of DeFi's economic structure, which is easy to form a transitional speculation situation and cause DeFi to lose its practical application value.

Since the beginning of the year, the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem has been exposed to a steady stream of news of malicious arbitrage by hackers exploiting the DeFi ecosystem's smart contract vulnerabilities. The malicious arbitrage of hackers by organizing different DeFi projects reflects the lack of coordination of decentralization in the DeFi ecosystem, as well as the vulnerability between smart contract combinations of different services.

"The Graph (GRT), also known as the ""Google of blockchain"", is the single most important piece of the blockchain puzzle and should be on your radar",https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/p5k7mo/the_graph_grt_also_known_as_the_google_of/,graph_marine,1,2021-08-17 01:00:36,0,/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/p5k7mo/the_graph_grt_also_known_as_the_google_of/,Fundamentals,"Think about a book - when you want to find a specific piece of information, you can either spend hours-days reading through the whole book to find it, or you can skip to the index and find it within seconds.

Before [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) ([GRT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/the-graph)) existed, developers who wanted to create decentralized apps needed to index all of Ethereum's data manually, a task which could take multiple developers months-years minimum to complete. The Graph indexes the previously unorganized blockchain data and makes it organized and easier for developers to create applications with.

Everytime a user is using a dApp (eg, Uniswap) to trade or view data, the dApp has to query The Graph for data. The Graph recently received up to 800 million daily queries in [May 2021](https://thegraph.com/blog/20billion-queries), with 20% growth monthly growth rate since launch in 2020.

Have you ever heard of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, Balancer, USDC, Synthetix, Sushiswap, MakerDAO, Yearn, Curve, or basically any of the popular dApps? They all functionally rely upon The Graph. A good representation of what The Graph is is when you use [info.uniswap.org](https://info.uniswap.org) \- all of this data comes from The Graph. Everytime you refresh, that's a query that Uniswap has to make to The Graph in order to provide you with up to data price data.

For the past 8+ months, dApps were getting this data for free, but soon they will migrate their subgraphs to the decentralized mainnet and be charged microfees per query. The query fees will be paid out amongst indexers (those who actually organize the data into subgraphs) and curators/delegators (those who stake/participants in the network). We are talking roughly $0.0001 or $0.00001 per query, so hundreds of millions of monthly capital flowing through The Graph and its participants.

Currently, there are 10-15 layer 1 blockchain networks (Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Polygon, and others) and hundreds of popular dApps (those listed above, and [more](https://thegraph.com/legacy-explorer/)) using The Graph. Several, like [Solana](https://solana.com/ecosystem/thegraph), asked The Graph to index their chain - they approached The Graph, not the other way around. However, in the future, there will be thousands of blockchain networks indexed by The Graph, millions of dApps/subgraphs, and trillions of daily queries. Imagine everyone using their phone to transact, refresh, and interact with media/applications that require data from The Graph.

When GRT launched, it was released on Kraken, Coinbase, and Binance on day 1 - no other coin in history has had this red carpet rollout, and there is good reason for it. All of these exchanges had [info pages](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-the-graph-grt) written for The Graph, where they referred to it as the ""Google of blockchain"".

The Graph is like a combination of decentralized versions of Google, banking, all of social media, all other service providers and other industries, all in one.

Edit: One response so far, in jest, mentioned that I did not mention Moons. Well, the layer 2 solution chosen by Reddit for Ethereum scaling of Reddit's subreddit token economy was [Arbitrum](https://portal.arbitrum.one/) (scroll to the bottom and you'll see The Graph's logo). Arbitrum not only uses The Graph, but [boasts its partnership with The Graph frequently](https://offchain.medium.com/the-graph-indexing-and-querying-services-are-live-on-arbitrum-one-c539a122da14). The Graph was recently given the honor of being [one of the first protocols to roll out on Arbitrum mainnet next month](https://thegraph.com/blog/arbitrum-graph).

Moons, and applications that are developed to implement the usage of Moons, will almost certainly be using The Graph on a fundamental level, as will the entirety of the token economy of Reddit. 

When Moons and Reddit subgraphs are created, users who hold GRT will be able to curate the subgraph. What that means is they will be able to stake their GRT to the subgraph to signal to indexers that it will be a valuable subgraph and will yield many queries. The more queries, the more applications have to pay indexers, and the more the indexers indexing the subgraph and the curators signaling that the subgraph would be profitable, profit.

So you can actually use GRT's curation market as a predictions market to ""bet on"" Moons and Reddit's token economy being successful by staking to their respective subgraphs using GRT and profiting off of their growth over time."
Zero-Coupon Bond in DeFi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/p5ycnm/zerocoupon_bond_in_defi/,economicsdesign,1,2021-08-17 14:33:14,0,/r/ethtrader/comments/p5ycnm/zerocoupon_bond_in_defi/,Discussion," 

DeFi is booming. And it is starting with lending and borrowing. In this article, we will discuss the interest rates in the crypto lending and borrowing industry. Specifically, zero-coupon bond. In the next newsletters, we will dive into interest rate swaps, direct collateralised swaps and other interesting structures.

# General Conclusion

Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is the hottest use case of Ethereum at present. DeFi has been attracting the attention of the community. In recent times, we have been experiencing a DeFi summer with the fastest growth since its inception.

DeFi is transparent and autonomous. It is a set of execution of smart contracts which operate on a publicly viewable blockchain. Users need not rely upon any party or anyone. This mechanism empowers everyone who interacts with protocols.

**Lending and Borrowing**

Most popular use case of DeFi is lending and borrowing. On DeFi, we can find lending money to strangers easily by smart contracts. This means we can give someone our money to earn passive income, at the same time borrowers will also mortgage their assets to get coins they want. The collateral is not the physical asset like gold, silver or real estate. Here, the collateral is cryptocurrencies.

**Interest Rates**

One such platform is MakerDAO which has 2.8M $ETH locked (\~2.45% existing $ETH supply). MakerDAO provides $DAI — a stablecoin, when users lock-in ETH. $DAI is tried to peg at $1. It provides liquidity into the MakerDAO system. There are many other DeFi dapps like Compound, Aave, Sushiswap, etc. who use $DAI. They are providing different types of lending and borrowing assets which is backed by collaterals. Borrow and lend relate to the **floating (or variable) interest rate.** DeFi is doing well.

&gt;But, DeFi still lacks one important tool which provides **the fixed interest rate.**

# Fixed Interest Rate

In traditional finance, the Fixed interest rate often understood as low-risk interest rates and almost absolutely safe. It is a needed and important factor. Clearly, it affects other factors in the economy: lending rates of banks, Interbank interest rates, Gold Price, Real Estate Price, etc. On a more macro level, one country's interest rates can affect other countries with each trading relationship.

On DeFi the same. The Fixed Interest Rate will impact investor's behaviour because a rational investor always tries to produce a yield greater than the fixed interest rate (in this case). That means it will impact our portfolio.

Fixed Interest Rate does not change during a loan period, allowing borrowers/lenders to accurately predict how much they need to pay or receive in future.

Currently, DeFi has a lot of projects starting to implement fixed-rate products with 2 main approaches:

(1) Zero-coupon bond.

(2) Direct Collateralised Swap.

# Zero-Coupon Bond

A zero-coupon bond (ZCB) pays a fixed yield on maturity. The crypto market is volatile and lending-borrowing is taking place on a variable rate of interest. But other one wants to control risky better by using the fixed interest rate products. Non-availability of a fixed rate of interest is a barrier towards mass adoption of DeFi.

## So what is zero-coupon bond ?

&gt;A zero-coupon bond is a type of bond that does not pay interest periodically. That is interest is paid at the time of the bond purchase or on the maturity date.

### Valuation

The present value of the bond is determined by its future face value, the interest rate of the bond and the duration of the bond.

    PNV = (FaceValue)/(1+r)^n

All things equal,

* Higher duration = lower price to pay now
* Higher face value = higher price to pay now
* Higher interest rate = lower price to pay now

## In DeFi

2 ways we see zero-coupon bond concept:

1. An ERC20 token with the above mechanism — lower price now for future payouts
2. Protocol like YIELD.IS

### ERC20 token as zero-coupon bond

Crypto research company Paradigm published a whitepaper (April 2020) depicting how to make and issuance of the zero-coupon bond as ERC20 tokens which is called yTokens.

As this whitepaper, ""*yTokens are like the zero-coupon bonds and are backed by collateral in another asset. By buying or selling y Tokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a fixed term. yTokens are fungible and trade at a floating price, which means their “interest rates” are determined by the market. The prices of yTokens of varying maturities can be used to infer interest rates, and even to construct a yield curve. Depending on the target asset, yTokens can settle through “cash-settlement” using an on-chain price oracle, through “physical settlement” in the target ERC20 token, or by synthetically issuing or borrowing the target ERC20 token on another platform.""*

To make sense easier, participants in the protocols using zero-coupon bond include the borrower, the lender, the liquidity provider.

* **The borrower** will mortgage the asset, in exchange for the token representing the loan, debt tokens can be redeemed at a fixed value in the future. The borrower then sells the debt token at a discount.
* **The lender** is a person who buys a bond at a discount price and receives interest when the bond matures.
* **The liquidity provider** that will provide liquidity for the bond in return receives transaction fees and profits when the bond matures.  
📷

yToken's yield doesn't rely upon system governance. It decides price according to market price rather than depending on governance or any formula.

Compare with $DAI, the problem of $DAI is that it is pegged to $1 but the collateral is not USD and the interest rate is continuously changed by the governance model, theoretically. But yToken price is expected to float and the interest rate will be determined by the trade discount. It also will have an expiration date. If you hold yToken for a certain period, you would earn predictable of interest and if you withdraw early (difference with selling), you may incur a loss.

**But how does the system work exactly?**

""You can create yTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to effectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying yTokens is economically similar to lending\* the target asset. The effective ‘interest rate’ received by yToken holders is determined by the discount at which yTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.”

\**Lending the asset because when you buy the bond via owning yTokens, it transfers the ownership of the collateral from the depositor to you.*

A sample use case:

James wants to lend 10,000 $ETH and earns interest for 1 month. The current price of yToken (that bond token) is 0.98 $ETH. With 10,000 $ETH, he can get 10,204.08 yTokens.

If he keeps it for 1 year, he will get out 204.08 $ETH.

But he only wants to keep it for 1 month. So he earns 17 $ETH. (204.08/17)

At the end of 1 month, he gets back his principle (10,000 ETH) and interest (17 ETH).

The volatility of $ETH does not affect the yield in $ETH as the yToken has been issued against the borrower's collateralised Ethereum.

&gt;Aka, the principle and interest are denominated in the same asset. Hence, not affected by volatility.

## New Same DeFi Product

### Reflex Bond

One of those top upstart efforts is **Reflex bonds** by blockchain developer Stefan Ionescu. he outlined how to create a bond product on Ethereum that provide price stability (as stablecoins) without maintaining an arbitrary and common in the cryptoeconomy to date.

In other words, reflex bonds would have ""floating redemption prices""-the same with $yToken that I mentioned, that has the ability to minimise the price volatility from the market compared to stablecoins.

The purpose of a reflex bond is to be a more stable representation of its collateral while maintaining a high level of reliability. If it is used in other platforms, a reflex bond can protect its user from huge and sudden volatility.

### Notional Finance

Notional Finance has launched a fixed-rate borrowing/lending protocol through a financial method called $fCash. $fCash are negotiable tokens that represent positive or negative cash flow requirements at a specific point in the future, and can be traded against the base currency (e.g. $DAI, $USDC) in the liquidity groups that support AMM.

Lenders buy $fCash and close a rate that represents the amount of the base currency they can claim against their $fCash at maturity. The borrower uses $fCash and can sell it to receive the base currency, in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the base currency at a specific time in the future. $fCash tokens are always paired - assets and liabilities are always zero on the Notional system.

### UMA's yUSD

UMA has launched its first yield dollar token -$yUSD (SEP20), which is essentially a zero-coupon bond redeemable for $1 at the expiry date and can be traded with $USDC through Balancer AMM.

**TLDR:**

&gt;Economics of tokenisation and ecosystem is free weekly in your inbox. Please share it with anyone that can benefit from this knowledge.

We have explained that those products about Fixed Interest Rate, although they are quite new they are essential in the DeFi space. More Fixed Interest Rate products will appear in the future and are intended for those who want risk control and easy access to traditional investment firms that use Fixed Interest Rates for their portfolios.

Next, we will continue to showcase another interesting product, the Interest Rate Swap. They are also in essence a derivative product."

Crypto research company Paradigm published a whitepaper (April 2020) depicting how to make and issuance of the zero-coupon bond as ERC20 tokens which is called yTokens.As this whitepaper, ""*yTokens are like the zero-coupon bonds and are backed by collateral in another asset. By buying or selling y Tokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a fixed term. yTokens are fungible and trade at a floating price, which means their “interest rates” are determined by the market. The prices of yTokens of varying maturities can be used to infer interest rates, and even to construct a yield curve. Depending on the target asset, yTokens can settle through “cash-settlement” using an on-chain price oracle, through “physical settlement” in the target ERC20 token, or by synthetically issuing or borrowing the target ERC20 token on another platform.""*To make sense easier, participants in the protocols using zero-coupon bond include the borrower, the lender, the liquidity provider.

* **The borrower** will mortgage the asset, in exchange for the token representing the loan, debt tokens can be redeemed at a fixed value in the future. The borrower then sells the debt token at a discount.
* **The lender** is a person who buys a bond at a discount price and receives interest when the bond matures.
* **The liquidity provider** that will provide liquidity for the bond in return receives transaction fees and profits when the bond matures. 📷

yToken's yield doesn't rely upon system governance. It decides price according to market price rather than depending on governance or any formula.Compare with $DAI, the problem of $DAI is that it is pegged to $1 but the collateral is not USD and the interest rate is continuously changed by the governance model, theoretically. But yToken price is expected to float and the interest rate will be determined by the trade discount. It also will have an expiration date. If you hold yToken for a certain period, you would earn predictable of interest and if you withdraw early (difference with selling), you may incur a loss.**But how does the system work exactly?**""You can create yTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to effectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying yTokens is economically similar to lending\* the target asset. The effective ‘interest rate’ received by yToken holders is determined by the discount at which yTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.”\**Lending the asset because when you buy the bond via owning yTokens, it transfers the ownership of the collateral from the depositor to you.*A sample use case:James wants to lend 10,000 $ETH and earns interest for 1 month. The current price of yToken (that bond token) is 0.98 $ETH. With 10,000 $ETH, he can get 10,204.08 yTokens.If he keeps it for 1 year, he will get out 204.08 $ETH.But he only wants to keep it for 1 month. So he earns 17 $ETH. (204.08/17)At the end of 1 month, he gets back his principle (10,000 ETH) and interest (17 ETH).The volatility of $ETH does not affect the yield in $ETH as the yToken has been issued against the borrower's collateralised Ethereum.

&gt;Aka, the principle and interest are denominated in the same asset. Hence, not affected by volatility.

### Reflex Bond

One of those top upstart efforts is **Reflex bonds** by blockchain developer Stefan Ionescu. he outlined how to create a bond product on Ethereum that provide price stability (as stablecoins) without maintaining an arbitrary and common in the cryptoeconomy to date.In other words, reflex bonds would have ""floating redemption prices""-the same with $yToken that I mentioned, that has the ability to minimise the price volatility from the market compared to stablecoins.The purpose of a reflex bond is to be a more stable representation of its collateral while maintaining a high level of reliability. If it is used in other platforms, a reflex bond can protect its user from huge and sudden volatility.

### Notional Finance

Notional Finance has launched a fixed-rate borrowing/lending protocol through a financial method called $fCash. $fCash are negotiable tokens that represent positive or negative cash flow requirements at a specific point in the future, and can be traded against the base currency (e.g. $DAI, $USDC) in the liquidity groups that support AMM.Lenders buy $fCash and close a rate that represents the amount of the base currency they can claim against their $fCash at maturity. The borrower uses $fCash and can sell it to receive the base currency, in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the base currency at a specific time in the future. $fCash tokens are always paired - assets and liabilities are always zero on the Notional system.

# General Conclusion

Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is the hottest use case of Ethereum at present. DeFi has been attracting the attention of the community. In recent times, we have been experiencing a DeFi summer with the fastest growth since its inception.DeFi is transparent and autonomous. It is a set of execution of smart contracts which operate on a publicly viewable blockchain. Users need not rely upon any party or anyone. This mechanism empowers everyone who interacts with protocols.**Lending and Borrowing**Most popular use case of DeFi is lending and borrowing. On DeFi, we can find lending money to strangers easily by smart contracts. This means we can give someone our money to earn passive income, at the same time borrowers will also mortgage their assets to get coins they want. The collateral is not the physical asset like gold, silver or real estate. Here, the collateral is cryptocurrencies.**Interest Rates**One such platform is MakerDAO which has 2.8M $ETH locked (\~2.45% existing $ETH supply). MakerDAO provides $DAI — a stablecoin, when users lock-in ETH. $DAI is tried to peg at $1. It provides liquidity into the MakerDAO system. There are many other DeFi dapps like Compound, Aave, Sushiswap, etc. who use $DAI. They are providing different types of lending and borrowing assets which is backed by collaterals. Borrow and lend relate to the **floating (or variable) interest rate.** DeFi is doing well.

&gt;But, DeFi still lacks one important tool which provides **the fixed interest rate.**

# Fixed Interest Rate

In traditional finance, the Fixed interest rate often understood as low-risk interest rates and almost absolutely safe. It is a needed and important factor. Clearly, it affects other factors in the economy: lending rates of banks, Interbank interest rates, Gold Price, Real Estate Price, etc. On a more macro level, one country's interest rates can affect other countries with each trading relationship.On DeFi the same. The Fixed Interest Rate will impact investor's behaviour because a rational investor always tries to produce a yield greater than the fixed interest rate (in this case). That means it will impact our portfolio.Fixed Interest Rate does not change during a loan period, allowing borrowers/lenders to accurately predict how much they need to pay or receive in future.Currently, DeFi has a lot of projects starting to implement fixed-rate products with 2 main approaches:(1) Zero-coupon bond.(2) Direct Collateralised Swap.

# Zero-Coupon Bond

A zero-coupon bond (ZCB) pays a fixed yield on maturity. The crypto market is volatile and lending-borrowing is taking place on a variable rate of interest. But other one wants to control risky better by using the fixed interest rate products. Non-availability of a fixed rate of interest is a barrier towards mass adoption of DeFi.

## So what is zero-coupon bond ?

&gt;A zero-coupon bond is a type of bond that does not pay interest periodically. That is interest is paid at the time of the bond purchase or on the maturity date.

### Valuation

The present value of the bond is determined by its future face value, the interest rate of the bond and the duration of the bond.

    PNV = (FaceValue)/(1+r)^n

All things equal,

* Higher duration = lower price to pay now
* Higher face value = higher price to pay now
* Higher interest rate = lower price to pay now

## In DeFi

2 ways we see zero-coupon bond concept:

1. An ERC20 token with the above mechanism — lower price now for future payouts
2. Protocol like YIELD.IS

# General Conclusion

Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is the hottest use case of Ethereum at present. DeFi has been attracting the attention of the community. In recent times, we have been experiencing a DeFi summer with the fastest growth since its inception.DeFi is transparent and autonomous. It is a set of execution of smart contracts which operate on a publicly viewable blockchain. Users need not rely upon any party or anyone. This mechanism empowers everyone who interacts with protocols.**Lending and Borrowing**Most popular use case of DeFi is lending and borrowing. On DeFi, we can find lending money to strangers easily by smart contracts. This means we can give someone our money to earn passive income, at the same time borrowers will also mortgage their assets to get coins they want. The collateral is not the physical asset like gold, silver or real estate. Here, the collateral is cryptocurrencies.**Interest Rates**One such platform is MakerDAO which has 2.8M $ETH locked (\~2.45% existing $ETH supply). MakerDAO provides $DAI — a stablecoin, when users lock-in ETH. $DAI is tried to peg at $1. It provides liquidity into the MakerDAO system. There are many other DeFi dapps like Compound, Aave, Sushiswap, etc. who use $DAI. They are providing different types of lending and borrowing assets which is backed by collaterals. Borrow and lend relate to the **floating (or variable) interest rate.** DeFi is doing well.

&gt;But, DeFi still lacks one important tool which provides **the fixed interest rate.**

# Fixed Interest Rate

In traditional finance, the Fixed interest rate often understood as low-risk interest rates and almost absolutely safe. It is a needed and important factor. Clearly, it affects other factors in the economy: lending rates of banks, Interbank interest rates, Gold Price, Real Estate Price, etc. On a more macro level, one country's interest rates can affect other countries with each trading relationship.On DeFi the same. The Fixed Interest Rate will impact investor's behaviour because a rational investor always tries to produce a yield greater than the fixed interest rate (in this case). That means it will impact our portfolio.Fixed Interest Rate does not change during a loan period, allowing borrowers/lenders to accurately predict how much they need to pay or receive in future.Currently, DeFi has a lot of projects starting to implement fixed-rate products with 2 main approaches:(1) Zero-coupon bond.(2) Direct Collateralised Swap.

# Zero-Coupon Bond

A zero-coupon bond (ZCB) pays a fixed yield on maturity. The crypto market is volatile and lending-borrowing is taking place on a variable rate of interest. But other one wants to control risky better by using the fixed interest rate products. Non-availability of a fixed rate of interest is a barrier towards mass adoption of DeFi.

## So what is zero-coupon bond ?

&gt;A zero-coupon bond is a type of bond that does not pay interest periodically. That is interest is paid at the time of the bond purchase or on the maturity date.

### Valuation

The present value of the bond is determined by its future face value, the interest rate of the bond and the duration of the bond.

    PNV = (FaceValue)/(1+r)^n

All things equal,

* Higher duration = lower price to pay now
* Higher face value = higher price to pay now
* Higher interest rate = lower price to pay now

## In DeFi

2 ways we see zero-coupon bond concept:

1. An ERC20 token with the above mechanism — lower price now for future payouts
2. Protocol like YIELD.IS

### ERC20 token as zero-coupon bond

Crypto research company Paradigm published a whitepaper (April 2020) depicting how to make and issuance of the zero-coupon bond as ERC20 tokens which is called yTokens.As this whitepaper, ""*yTokens are like the zero-coupon bonds and are backed by collateral in another asset. By buying or selling y Tokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a fixed term. yTokens are fungible and trade at a floating price, which means their “interest rates” are determined by the market. The prices of yTokens of varying maturities can be used to infer interest rates, and even to construct a yield curve. Depending on the target asset, yTokens can settle through “cash-settlement” using an on-chain price oracle, through “physical settlement” in the target ERC20 token, or by synthetically issuing or borrowing the target ERC20 token on another platform.""*To make sense easier, participants in the protocols using zero-coupon bond include the borrower, the lender, the liquidity provider.

* **The borrower** will mortgage the asset, in exchange for the token representing the loan, debt tokens can be redeemed at a fixed value in the future. The borrower then sells the debt token at a discount.
* **The lender** is a person who buys a bond at a discount price and receives interest when the bond matures.
* **The liquidity provider** that will provide liquidity for the bond in return receives transaction fees and profits when the bond matures. 📷

yToken's yield doesn't rely upon system governance. It decides price according to market price rather than depending on governance or any formula.Compare with $DAI, the problem of $DAI is that it is pegged to $1 but the collateral is not USD and the interest rate is continuously changed by the governance model, theoretically. But yToken price is expected to float and the interest rate will be determined by the trade discount. It also will have an expiration date. If you hold yToken for a certain period, you would earn predictable of interest and if you withdraw early (difference with selling), you may incur a loss.**But how does the system work exactly?**""You can create yTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to effectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying yTokens is economically similar to lending\* the target asset. The effective ‘interest rate’ received by yToken holders is determined by the discount at which yTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.”\**Lending the asset because when you buy the bond via owning yTokens, it transfers the ownership of the collateral from the depositor to you.*A sample use case:James wants to lend 10,000 $ETH and earns interest for 1 month. The current price of yToken (that bond token) is 0.98 $ETH. With 10,000 $ETH, he can get 10,204.08 yTokens.If he keeps it for 1 year, he will get out 204.08 $ETH.But he only wants to keep it for 1 month. So he earns 17 $ETH. (204.08/17)At the end of 1 month, he gets back his principle (10,000 ETH) and interest (17 ETH).The volatility of $ETH does not affect the yield in $ETH as the yToken has been issued against the borrower's collateralised Ethereum.

&gt;Aka, the principle and interest are denominated in the same asset. Hence, not affected by volatility.

## New Same DeFi Product

### Reflex Bond

One of those top upstart efforts is **Reflex bonds** by blockchain developer Stefan Ionescu. he outlined how to create a bond product on Ethereum that provide price stability (as stablecoins) without maintaining an arbitrary and common in the cryptoeconomy to date.In other words, reflex bonds would have ""floating redemption prices""-the same with $yToken that I mentioned, that has the ability to minimise the price volatility from the market compared to stablecoins.The purpose of a reflex bond is to be a more stable representation of its collateral while maintaining a high level of reliability. If it is used in other platforms, a reflex bond can protect its user from huge and sudden volatility.

### Notional Finance

Notional Finance has launched a fixed-rate borrowing/lending protocol through a financial method called $fCash. $fCash are negotiable tokens that represent positive or negative cash flow requirements at a specific point in the future, and can be traded against the base currency (e.g. $DAI, $USDC) in the liquidity groups that support AMM.Lenders buy $fCash and close a rate that represents the amount of the base currency they can claim against their $fCash at maturity. The borrower uses $fCash and can sell it to receive the base currency, in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the base currency at a specific time in the future. $fCash tokens are always paired - assets and liabilities are always zero on the Notional system.

### UMA's yUSD

UMA has launched its first yield dollar token -$yUSD (SEP20), which is essentially a zero-coupon bond redeemable for $1 at the expiry date and can be traded with $USDC through Balancer AMM.**TLDR:**

Depending on the target asset, yTokens can settle through “cash-settlement” using an on-chain price oracle, through “physical settlement” in the target ERC20 token, or by synthetically issuing or borrowing the target ERC20 token on another platform.""*To make sense easier, participants in the protocols using zero-coupon bond include the borrower, the lender, the liquidity provider.

* **The borrower** will mortgage the asset, in exchange for the token representing the loan, debt tokens can be redeemed at a fixed value in the future. The borrower then sells the debt token at a discount.
* **The lender** is a person who buys a bond at a discount price and receives interest when the bond matures.
* **The liquidity provider** that will provide liquidity for the bond in return receives transaction fees and profits when the bond matures. 📷

yToken's yield doesn't rely upon system governance. It decides price according to market price rather than depending on governance or any formula.Compare with $DAI, the problem of $DAI is that it is pegged to $1 but the collateral is not USD and the interest rate is continuously changed by the governance model, theoretically. But yToken price is expected to float and the interest rate will be determined by the trade discount. It also will have an expiration date. If you hold yToken for a certain period, you would earn predictable of interest and if you withdraw early (difference with selling), you may incur a loss.**But how does the system work exactly?**""You can create yTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to effectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying yTokens is economically similar to lending\* the target asset. The effective ‘interest rate’ received by yToken holders is determined by the discount at which yTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.”\**Lending the asset because when you buy the bond via owning yTokens, it transfers the ownership of the collateral from the depositor to you.*A sample use case:James wants to lend 10,000 $ETH and earns interest for 1 month. The current price of yToken (that bond token) is 0.98 $ETH. With 10,000 $ETH, he can get 10,204.08 yTokens.If he keeps it for 1 year, he will get out 204.08 $ETH.But he only wants to keep it for 1 month. So he earns 17 $ETH. (204.08/17)At the end of 1 month, he gets back his principle (10,000 ETH) and interest (17 ETH).The volatility of $ETH does not affect the yield in $ETH as the yToken has been issued against the borrower's collateralised Ethereum.

&gt;Aka, the principle and interest are denominated in the same asset. Hence, not affected by volatility.

## New Same DeFi Product

### Reflex Bond

One of those top upstart efforts is **Reflex bonds** by blockchain developer Stefan Ionescu. he outlined how to create a bond product on Ethereum that provide price stability (as stablecoins) without maintaining an arbitrary and common in the cryptoeconomy to date.In other words, reflex bonds would have ""floating redemption prices""-the same with $yToken that I mentioned, that has the ability to minimise the price volatility from the market compared to stablecoins.The purpose of a reflex bond is to be a more stable representation of its collateral while maintaining a high level of reliability. If it is used in other platforms, a reflex bond can protect its user from huge and sudden volatility.

### Notional Finance

Notional Finance has launched a fixed-rate borrowing/lending protocol through a financial method called $fCash. $fCash are negotiable tokens that represent positive or negative cash flow requirements at a specific point in the future, and can be traded against the base currency (e.g. $DAI, $USDC) in the liquidity groups that support AMM.Lenders buy $fCash and close a rate that represents the amount of the base currency they can claim against their $fCash at maturity. The borrower uses $fCash and can sell it to receive the base currency, in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the base currency at a specific time in the future. $fCash tokens are always paired - assets and liabilities are always zero on the Notional system.

### UMA's yUSD

UMA has launched its first yield dollar token -$yUSD (SEP20), which is essentially a zero-coupon bond redeemable for $1 at the expiry date and can be traded with $USDC through Balancer AMM.**TLDR:**

We have explained that those products about Fixed Interest Rate, although they are quite new they are essential in the DeFi space. More Fixed Interest Rate products will appear in the future and are intended for those who want risk control and easy access to traditional investment firms that use Fixed Interest Rates for their portfolios.Next, we will continue to showcase another interesting product, the Interest Rate Swap. They are also in essence a derivative product."

“Decentralized Finance” (DeFi) covers financial services performed on the blockchain. DeFi is a financial service without a centralized authority.
DeFi keeps the traditional elements of banking while eliminating the middleman by using a smart contract.
DeFi needs decentralized infrastructure to function.
DeFi’s inception was in 2015 on the dApp (decentralized App) MakerDAO. This platform allows users to use crypto as collateral to apply for loans.
DeFi functions as an open, trustless, and decentralized financial network. DeFi has no central ruling authority. Foul play is mitigated by the protocols being enforced with Smart contracts. DeFi has attracted many investors. This interest has skyrocketed the amount of tokens in DeFi to nearly $88 billion (USD) in mid-May 2021 (https://defipulse.

D-REIT is a project that bridges the gap between DeFi and new tangible investment opportunities that otherwise don’t exist on the blockchain.
Leveraging blockchain technology, D-REIT allows assets such as real estate, shares in companies, operations of renewable energy plants, and more to be traded on a native marketplace, facilitating P2P trades to both single buyers and crowdfunded projects.
Benefits generated on the platform, both on-chain (commissions generated within the platform) and off- chain (income from capital gains on the sale of real estate and rental income), will be distributed proportionally among the holders of DRT (D-REIT Token).

Mission Statement
Implement a scalable, decentralized, and autonomous platform based on blockchain technology with strong technical and security capabilities.
D-REIT offers users the opportunity to invest in projects of their choice, automatically earning users a portion of the profits generated.

Vision Statement
To be a decentralized and an autonomous business platform that creates financial opportunity and generates profitability. To facilitate the democratization
and accessibility of investments, granting opportunities for all types of investors. To offer the best adaptation strategies in an ever- changing economic environment by pioneering solutions through the use of blockchain technology."

BakerDAO System Upgrade Explanation and Q&amp;A | Review of the First AMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Baker_DAO/comments/p7e8ph/bakerdao_system_upgrade_explanation_and_qa_review/,Baker_DAO,1,2021-08-19 20:53:13,0,/r/u_Baker_DAO/comments/p7e8ph/bakerdao_system_upgrade_explanation_and_qa_review/,NaN,"  

At 20:00 (SGT) on August 13, 2021, DH, head of BakerDAO technical team, broadcasted an AMA live show on the Development Plan and System Design of BakerDAO System Upgrade Scheme V1.0 in ""BakerDAO 🥯Community"", giving an in-depth explanation of the system upgrade and answering related questions. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Highlights: DH, head of BakerDAO technical team, mentioned in the AMA live show that: V2.0 will be launched in September; the 24-hour TVL target is USD 300 million after launch; BAI will stabilize at USD 1; BKR will be benchmarked against MKR (up to USD 6,300), reach USD 1,000 by the end of the year, and will be listed on Binance Exchange.** 

**The script of this AMA is as follows:** 

&amp;#x200B;

Q1: Good evening, everyone. The long-awaited BakerDAO's first AMA has now started. Today we have DH, head of BakerDAO technical team, here with us. Anyone who is interested, especially our BakerDAO family members, is welcome to ask questions in an effort to build a strong BakerDAO community\~ 

**DH:** Hello, everyone. I am DH. As I am responsible for leading BakerDAO's product and technical team, I've been deeply involved in R&amp;D. I am also the main planner and drafter of the BakerDAO System Upgrade Scheme previously released. I'm very glad to have an AMA with our BakerDAO community to give an in-depth explanation of this system upgrade, and you are welcome to ask questions. 

In the beginning, I would like to talk about two topics: one is the overall system upgrade scheme, and the other is the version to be upgraded in September. 

First of all, we remade the version planning, and regarded the core BAI lending agreement that was first launched as V1.0. The subsequent systems will be upgraded on the basis of V1.0. The liquidation module will be called V1.1 after optimization, the BAI liquidation pool V1.2, the new version of liquidity mining V1.3, the DAO pool V1.6, the BAI stabilization pool V2.0, the open vault V3.0, and the aggregation platform V4.0. 

After all the system upgrades are completed, BakerDAO will have seven systems: the core Borrow system, BAI liquidation pool, BAI stabilization pool, DAO pool, liquidity mining, open vault, and aggregation platform. 

With the above seven systems, the three key problems encountered before, namely, liquidation, BAI instability and BKR instability, can be perfectly solved. The liquidation module optimization and BAI liquidation pool will solve the previous liquidation problem; the BAI liquidation pool, BAI stabilization pool and open vault will solve the problem of BAI stability and liquidity; the DAO pool gives BKR holders more returns and will solve the problem of BKR instability. 

We put a lot of effort to make this picture [Principle of the BakerDAO Upgrade Scheme.jpg](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/15/fgSv90.jpg). To enable the community to better understand the BakerDAO System Upgrade Scheme, I suggest everyone take a look at it carefully, and then you can also understand the difference between ours and other decentralized stablecoin protocols. We've always been innovating and creating value for BKR holders. 

Our first upgrade will be launched in September, the V2.0, which will include the liquidation module optimization, the BAI liquidation pool, the DAO pool, and the BAI stabilization pool. In fact, they are also the core components in the upgrade scheme. Upon completion, it shall be able to solve the above three problems. Meanwhile, it will also solve the problem of BAI liquidity and bring proceeds to BKR holders. Now I will introduce the overall development plan. 

For more details about the upgrade to V2.0, please read our article titled Development Plan and System Design of BakerDAO System Upgrade Scheme V1.0. 

After the V2.0 upgrade, BAI will stabilize around USD 1 and have sufficient liquidity. We will build a BAI ecosystem and find more partners to support the application of BAI. 

Someone mentioned MakerDAO just now. Our benchmark is MakerDAO on Ethereum. After this upgrade, BakerDAO will surpass MakerDAO at the product level, and then we will promote the building of community, operation and BAI ecosystem simultaneously. With the support of the community, we will complete the deployment of multiple chains. Then it will definitely surpass MakerDAO in every aspect and become the world's number one decentralized stablecoin. 

This is the general situation by now. I will not expand the details of the development work. Thank you for your participation\~\~\~ You may ask questions about the issues you are interested in. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q2:** Will it be launched soon? 

**DH:** Yes, it will be launched soon. The team has been designing, discussing, and verifying feasibility since the release of V1.0. We've been preparing for more than a month, and development is underway. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q3:** So what about the progress of development? 

**DH:** OK, I'll talk about the development progress first. At present, the overall completion rate is about 60%. The contract team has completed the development work and is doing the testing. The front-end page is 80% complete. Integration testing will be carried out after completion. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q4:** When can I use the BKR in our hands? 

**DH:** BKR can be pledged to the DAO pool after V2.0 to share the system revenue. According to related reports, MakerDAO's annual system revenue is hundreds of millions of US dollars, which is a substantial lot. But they don't share it with MKR holders. So this is a big step for us to share the proceeds with BKR holders. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q5:** Can you tell us about the new mining system? 

**DH:** The first mining system we will launch next month is for LBAI and SBAI. LBAI is the LP for the BAI liquidation pool and SABI is the LP for the BAI stabilization pool[\[c1\]](https://www.reddit.com/submit#_msocom_1) . This is to encourage more people to participate in the new system, as mining is lossless and risk-free. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q6:** How can we participate in mining? 

**DH:** Regarding how to participate in mining, I just prepared a description of the application methods for a few roles. You may read it. We will also prepare more detailed documents to teach you how to use the system. 

First of all, the mining in V2.0 is lossless and risk-free. The main purpose is to reward BKR to the lending and liquidation participants, BAI liquidity contributors, and BKR holders. There are several paths for your participation: 

1. BAI borrower: borrow BAI in the ""Borrow system"", pledge BAI to the ""BAI liquidation pool"" to share the liquidation proceeds and receive LP: LBAI, and pledge LBAI to participate in ""liquidity mining""; 

2. BKR holder: pledge &amp; lock BKR to ""DAO pool"" to receive a share of the system proceeds; 

3. BAI liquidity provider: provide liquidity of BAI and other stablecoins to the ""BAI stabilization pool"" to receive LP: SBAI, and pledge SBAI to participate in ""liquidity mining""; 

4. BAI trader: trade BAI in the ""BAI stabilization pool""; 

5. BKR liquidity miner: participate in ""liquidity mining"" to get LBKR; this is to reward users for pledging &amp; locking BKR: LBKR in the ""DAO pool"". 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q7:** The BKR trading pool is too shallow now. How to solve this problem? 

**DH:** We will consider solving the BKR liquidity problem after V2.0. Users may pledge BKR in the DAO pool, share the system proceeds, and participate in the governance vote in V2.0 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q8:** Can you provide a plain and simple liquidation tutorial? 

**DH:** Regarding liquidation, the liquidation rights will be withdrawn in V2.0. Only the BAI liquidation pool is involved in liquidation. At the same time, users who pledge BAI to the BAI liquidation pool can share the liquidation proceeds, so there is no need to worry about the previous scientist liquidation and system deficit. The liquidation pool will no longer bring deficit to the lending system. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q9:** Do you have any expectation on the TVL after this upgrade? How much can it reach? 

**DH:** Our TVL goal is USD 300 million in 24 hours after the launch. All parties are working towards this goal. By then everyone is welcome to participate in the lossless, risk-free mining. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q10:** Is there any plan to get BKR listed on any exchange? 

**DH:** Our target exchange is Binance Exchange. After the V2.0 upgrade, we will have in-depth communication with Binance Exchange and also participate in various activities of BSC. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q11:** At present, only a small group of users are participating in the BKR project. How can you attract more people to join in later? 

**DH:** We will organize a series of promotion and marketing activities before the launch. Our first goal is to expand the community and attract more supporters. We also hope that users can introduce BakerDAO to their friends and expand the BakerDAO community together\~. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q12:** Have you considered the follow-up promotion? How to get foreigners involved in the future? 

**DH:** We are also speeding up to build the BakerDAO English community. Meanwhile, we are looking for foreign publicity and promotion channels to find more BSC users to join in and support BakerDAO, which is also the priority in our future work. 

**DH:** Time is up. We have to stop here today. Thank you very much for joining us \~ If you have any question in the future, you may ask in the ""BakerDAO 🥯Community"", or send it to BakerDAO. I will receive it promptly, and try to give my best answer. With your support, BakerDAO will grow stronger. Let’s build a mighty BakerDAO community together \~"

"The Graph (GRT), also known as the ""Google of blockchain"", is the single most important piece of the blockchain puzzle",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p7r2o6/the_graph_grt_also_known_as_the_google_of/,graph_marine,1,2021-08-20 08:15:23,59,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p7r2o6/the_graph_grt_also_known_as_the_google_of/,FUN,"Think about a book - when you want to find a specific piece of information, you can either spend hours-days reading through the whole book to find it, or you can skip to the index and find it within seconds.

Before [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) ([GRT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/the-graph)) existed, developers who wanted to create decentralized apps needed to index all of Ethereum's data manually, a task which could take multiple developers months-years minimum to complete. The Graph indexes the previously unorganized blockchain data and makes it organized and easier for developers to create applications with.

Everytime a user is using a dApp (eg, Uniswap) to trade or view data, the dApp has to query The Graph for data. The Graph recently received up to 800 million daily queries in [May 2021](https://thegraph.com/blog/20billion-queries), with 20% growth monthly growth rate since launch in 2020.

Have you ever heard of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, Balancer, USDC, Synthetix, Sushiswap, MakerDAO, Yearn, Curve, or basically any of the popular dApps? They all functionally rely upon The Graph. A good representation of what The Graph is is when you use [info.uniswap.org](https://info.uniswap.org) \- all of this data comes from The Graph. Everytime you refresh, that's a query that Uniswap has to make to The Graph in order to provide you with up to data price data.

For the past 8+ months, dApps were getting this data for free, but soon they will migrate their subgraphs to the decentralized mainnet and be charged microfees per query. The query fees will be paid out amongst indexers (those who actually organize the data into subgraphs) and curators/delegators (those who stake/participants in the network). We are talking roughly $0.0001 or $0.00001 per query, so hundreds of millions of monthly capital flowing through The Graph and its participants.

Currently, there are 10-15 layer 1 blockchain networks (Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Polygon, and others) and hundreds of popular dApps (those listed above, and [more](https://thegraph.com/legacy-explorer/)) using The Graph. Several, like [Solana](https://solana.com/ecosystem/thegraph), asked The Graph to index their chain - they approached The Graph, not the other way around. However, in the future, there will be thousands of blockchain networks indexed by The Graph, millions of dApps/subgraphs, and trillions of daily queries. Imagine everyone using their phone to transact, refresh, and interact with media/applications that require data from The Graph.

When GRT launched, it was released on Kraken, Coinbase, and Binance on day 1 - no other coin in history has had this red carpet rollout, and there is good reason for it. All of these exchanges had [info pages](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-the-graph-grt) written for The Graph, where they referred to it as the ""Google of blockchain"".

The Graph is like a combination of decentralized versions of Google, banking, all of social media, all other service providers and other industries, all in one.

Edit: One response so far, in jest, mentioned that I did not mention Moons. Well, the layer 2 solution chosen by Reddit for Ethereum scaling of Reddit's subreddit token economy was [Arbitrum](https://portal.arbitrum.one/) (scroll to the bottom and you'll see The Graph's logo). Arbitrum not only uses The Graph, but [boasts its partnership with The Graph frequently](https://offchain.medium.com/the-graph-indexing-and-querying-services-are-live-on-arbitrum-one-c539a122da14). The Graph was recently given the honor of being [one of the first protocols to roll out on Arbitrum mainnet next month](https://thegraph.com/blog/arbitrum-graph).

Moons, and applications that are developed to implement the usage of Moons, will almost certainly be using The Graph on a fundamental level, as will the entirety of the token economy of Reddit. 

When Moons and Reddit subgraphs are created, users who hold GRT will be able to curate the subgraph. What that means is they will be able to stake their GRT to the subgraph to signal to indexers that it will be a valuable subgraph and will yield many queries. The more queries, the more applications have to pay indexers, and the more the indexers indexing the subgraph and the curators signaling that the subgraph would be profitable, profit.

So you can actually use GRT's curation market as a predictions market to ""bet on"" Moons and Reddit's token economy being successful by staking to their respective subgraphs using GRT and profiting off of their growth over time."
Is the Peg Stability Module actually used? How does DAI maintain its price of $1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/p7x9z5/is_the_peg_stability_module_actually_used_how/,karna852,1,2021-08-20 15:23:28,9,/r/MakerDAO/comments/p7x9z5/is_the_peg_stability_module_actually_used_how/,NaN,"It's quite confusing - I don't understand what are all of the mechanisms that allows DAI to remain at $1. Please don't just point me to the docs or the white paper - I have read both and attempted to understand both.

As far as I can tell here are the mechanisms (I am talking about Multicollateral DAI, not SAI).

1. Interest rates. MKR owners can vote to set the savings rate and the interest rate charged for borrowers. A higher savings rate causes more DAI to come into vaults, lowering DAI supply and hopefully increasing price. A lower interest rate for borrowing, makes borrowing cheaper, encouraging borrowing and increasing the amount of DAI in circulation, raising the supply and lowering price. 
2. Auctions. Suppose the cause of DAI being &lt; $1 is due to a fall in the general crypto market and is accompanied by falls in the price of BAT and ETH (which, apart from USDC, also account for collateral put up for a loan). When the price falls so much that there is not enough collateral to justify the loan, an auction is created in which people can use DAI to buy that collateral at a discounted rate. Therefore they lock up DAI in exchange for buying that collateral. 
   1. Suppose the cause of DAI being &gt; $1 is due to increased demand for DAI. We want to issue more DAI in order to expand supply. This is correlated with having more DAI with MKR. MKR holders (who are incentivized because they govern the DAI token and if they burn MKR, the price of MKR will rise), use their MKR tokens to buy DAI and release it into the market. This causes the supply of DAI to go up, lowering the price.
   2. If nobody wants to buy the collateral, people who want to own MKR, use DAI to pay for the outstanding debt and are issued MKR tokens in return. This restricts the DAI supply and also punishes MKR owners by reducing the price of MKR.
3. Market Maker Keepers --&gt; I seriously don't think I understand this, and the docs are absolutely terrible.
   1.  I \*think\* these are bots that will offer to buy/sell DAI within a set of defined prices (called bands). 
   2. I \*do not understand\* how they actually cause the price of DAI to move back to $1.
   3. You might be smarter than I - if you can understand this - [https://github.com/makerdao/market-maker-keeper](https://github.com/makerdao/market-maker-keeper), please explain it to me. 
4. Arbitrage
   1. If the price of DAI is &lt; $1 and I expect it to return to $1. I am incentivized to buy DAI at below $1 and wait for it to rise to $1. I can make risk free profit here.
   2. I don't understand how Arbitrage helps if DAI is &gt; $1. 
5. Emergency Shutdown.
   1. In this case, something bad has really happened. The system stops allowing new vaults to be created and stops issuing new DAI. Instead, everyone who holds DAI gets back a part of the total collateral in the system (so everything deposited + everything stored from the stability fees). 
   2. **Not sure how this maintains day to day peg stability, or how it maintains stability in the event that there's a large loss of confidence in all collateral types.** 

***Questions***

1. How do market maker keeper bots help with keeping the price at $1?
2. Do arbitrage bots have a place in Multicollateral DAI, or are they deprecated?
3. What is the role of the Peg Stability Module? I asked on the DAI chat and someone said ""Yes - arbitraging, mainly using the Peg Stability Module is very much still relevant."", but I can't find any indication of its use in the docs or in Github.
4. How does the Emergency Shutdown mechanism help maintain the price at $1?

I'm in the middle of a deep dive into DAI and trying to simplify a lot of the language so that people can understand what is going on.

I intend to release this freely and publicly.

Any help would be great!

Thanks!"

Kava Labs is a developer of Kava Platform, the most trusted DeFi platform by financial institutions. This subreddit is officially managed by Kava Labs.

Kava Platform aims to become the default DeFi platform by providing stablecoins and decentralized lending against all major crypto assets. Kava utilizes Cosmos and operates with a Tendermint-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. At its core, Kava relies on a system similar to MakerDAO with CDPs but leverages the zones from Cosmos to add cryptocurrencies running on independent networks (e.g., XRP, Bitcoin). Kava Platform delivers 3 different applications (Kava Protocol, Hard Protocol, Swap Protocol) that allows users to mint, lend and swap all in one place.

ALPHA - is OIN the next Near Ecosystem Gem for Guaranteed 10x?!,https://www.reddit.com/r/nearprotocol/comments/p94di3/alpha_is_oin_the_next_near_ecosystem_gem_for/,fatbutfriendly,3,2021-08-22 10:30:19,10,/r/nearprotocol/comments/p94di3/alpha_is_oin_the_next_near_ecosystem_gem_for/,NaN,"Hello friends!

NEAR is Pumping. OCT sale is pumping. Skyward and REF are pumping. The entire ecosystem is starting to gain momentum. FOMO is in the air... But, I think I came across an underrated opportunity: [oin.finance](https://oin.finance) 

There's a few different pieces to this puzzle that only OGs and basement dwelling degenerates are starting to grasp now:

1. Launch of Metapool ([https://twitter.com/meta\_pool](https://twitter.com/meta_pool)), the first Liquid Staking solution on Near. Metapool is going to unlock a ton of liquidity that is currently locked in Staking (users lock their Near to secure the network and receive rewards approx. 10%). With Liquid Staking, they are still locking their assets with Metapool and receiving staking rewards BUT now they also receive stNEAR, a token that represents their stake. This token can now be used elsewhere in the Defi ecosystem for leverage: i.e. put down as collateral and take out USD loan.
2. Recent S[taking and Collaterals AMA Featuring Metapool and OIN Finance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L7GJUKLeQw)
3. OIN Finance enters the picture; they'll be among the first platforms to receive stNEAR to issue a Near Native USD stable coin (similar to MakerDao and DAI).
4. ATM the OIN token doesn't really do much, but it has been said by the team during other AMAs that fee share to token holders is coming (DYOR).
5. OIN is a multi chain protocol, but I believe that even with just the Near integration they could fly.

At the core of the investment thesis above is that OIN is dramatically cheap right now. Market Cap is around $4m with fully diluted under $20m. With such low valuations, and such strong integrations coming up, I am pretty bullish on this one. \* NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE \*

Let me know what you think?"

# General Conclusion

MakerDAO is one of the core project on DeFi. The foundation of the project is built on the Ethereum blockchain. The two main components are $DAI (stablecoin) and $MKR (governance). The protocol creates $DAI that is backed by $ETH using a vault mechanism.This system is able to regulate and stabilise the price of $DAI stablecoin. This protocol is also the first successful onchain reserve stablecoin.

# Stablecoin Classification

The mechanisms of stablecoins have changed since 2017 and we're going to start classifying stablecoins into four different categories:

&gt;Check the previous newsletter if you want more clarity.

1. Mechanisms
2. Peg
3. Collateral Amount
4. Collateral Type

# MakerDAO

In MakerDAO’s ecosystem, $DAI is the stablecoin and uses a dual token and reserve mechanism. It is soft pegged to one dollar and uses over-collateralisation to get that one dollar. It uses different kinds of on-chain crypto assets like $ETH, stablecoins, and non-stablecoins.

## Dual Token Mechanism

In the dual token model, as the name suggests, there are two tokens in the system. The primary token is stablecoin $DAI which is soft pegged to the US dollar. The secondary token is $MKR. The main function of the secondary token is to absorb volatility in the system. Think of $DAI as your output which is stable and has low volatility, but because there will always be volatility within the system or outside of the system. The volatility needs to go somewhere, so it goes to the other token, $MKR.

## Functions of the MKR Token

This is a utility token and functions as a governance token for voting. It can be used to pay off interest accrued in the system, and during insolvency. During crashes or different kinds of liquidation $MKR can be minted and sold for $DAI in the ecosystem. $MKR is a crucial aspect of governing the entire system of $DAI. $DAI is the facilitator that allows people to exchange goods and services. A few months ago MakerDAO moved more of its funds towards the DAO which means that it is no longer mainly controlled by the founders and is now controlled by the community.

## Reserve Mechanism

This means that the stablecoin or the $DAI is backed by reserves and you can use the $DAI to redeem the underlying collateral. You can redeem $DAI for the underlying crypto assets that you deposited to get $DAI initially.

# Creating $DAI: How it Works

You can create $DAI in three simple steps:

1. You have to own the asset.
2. You deposit that asset into a vault.
3. Based on the amount of value in the vault you can mint some $DAI out and then can use it in some other system.

The only thing that you have to be careful about is the minimum collateralisation ratio. If I have $150 worth of $ETH and I put it in my vault then I can take out a maximum of 100 $DAI from this vault and spend it somewhere else. My $150 worth of $ETH sits in the vault. I cannot touch it until I repay the amount that I borrowed, which is 100 $DAI.

## What happens when your $ETH falls in value?

I put $150 worth of $ETH in the vault but if the value falls to $100 then my collateralisation ratio is 100% which is less than the ideal amount of 150%. Now I will have to either repay the loan (instead of borrowing 100 $DAI I must repay 33 $DAI) or I will have to add $50 worth of $ETH into the collateral so that the minimum collateralisation ratio or the *c-ratio* is balanced. **TLDR:**MakerDAO is a novel and innovative protocol that allows for on-chain collateralised borrowing, while also creating a reasonably effective stablecoin. This gives the crypto community an alternative to fiat-backed stablecoins like $USDT. Furthermore, $MKR holders continue to make continual improvements to the protocol, so it is very likely that the risks we have outlined could largely be mitigated in the future."

If I have $150 worth of $ETH and I put it in my vault then I can take out a maximum of 100 $DAI from this vault and spend it somewhere else. My $150 worth of $ETH sits in the vault. I cannot touch it until I repay the amount that I borrowed, which is 100 $DAI.

## What happens when your $ETH falls in value?

I put $150 worth of $ETH in the vault but if the value falls to $100 then my collateralisation ratio is 100% which is less than the ideal amount of 150%. Now I will have to either repay the loan (instead of borrowing 100 $DAI I must repay 33 $DAI) or I will have to add $50 worth of $ETH into the collateral so that the minimum collateralisation ratio or the *c-ratio* is balanced. **TLDR:**MakerDAO is a novel and innovative protocol that allows for on-chain collateralised borrowing, while also creating a reasonably effective stablecoin. This gives the crypto community an alternative to fiat-backed stablecoins like $USDT. Furthermore, $MKR holders continue to make continual improvements to the protocol, so it is very likely that the risks we have outlined could largely be mitigated in the future."

# General Conclusion

MakerDAO is one of the core project on DeFi. The foundation of the project is built on the Ethereum blockchain. The two main components are $DAI (stablecoin) and $MKR (governance). The protocol creates $DAI that is backed by $ETH using a vault mechanism.This system is able to regulate and stabilise the price of $DAI stablecoin. This protocol is also the first successful onchain reserve stablecoin.

# Stablecoin Classification

The mechanisms of stablecoins have changed since 2017 and we're going to start classifying stablecoins into four different categories:

# MakerDAO

In MakerDAO’s ecosystem, $DAI is the stablecoin and uses a dual token and reserve mechanism. It is soft pegged to one dollar and uses over-collateralisation to get that one dollar. It uses different kinds of on-chain crypto assets like $ETH, stablecoins, and non-stablecoins.

## Dual Token Mechanism

In the dual token model, as the name suggests, there are two tokens in the system. The primary token is stablecoin $DAI which is soft pegged to the US dollar. The secondary token is $MKR. The main function of the secondary token is to absorb volatility in the system. Think of $DAI as your output which is stable and has low volatility, but because there will always be volatility within the system or outside of the system. The volatility needs to go somewhere, so it goes to the other token, $MKR.

## Functions of the MKR Token

This is a utility token and functions as a governance token for voting. It can be used to pay off interest accrued in the system, and during insolvency. During crashes or different kinds of liquidation $MKR can be minted and sold for $DAI in the ecosystem. $MKR is a crucial aspect of governing the entire system of $DAI. $DAI is the facilitator that allows people to exchange goods and services. A few months ago MakerDAO moved more of its funds towards the DAO which means that it is no longer mainly controlled by the founders and is now controlled by the community.

## Reserve Mechanism

This means that the stablecoin or the $DAI is backed by reserves and you can use the $DAI to redeem the underlying collateral. You can redeem $DAI for the underlying crypto assets that you deposited to get $DAI initially.

# Creating $DAI: How it Works

You can create $DAI in three simple steps:

1. You have to own the asset.
2. You deposit that asset into a vault.
3. Based on the amount of value in the vault you can mint some $DAI out and then can use it in some other system.

The only thing that you have to be careful about is the minimum collateralisation ratio. If I have $150 worth of $ETH and I put it in my vault then I can take out a maximum of 100 $DAI from this vault and spend it somewhere else. My $150 worth of $ETH sits in the vault. I cannot touch it until I repay the amount that I borrowed, which is 100 $DAI.

The mechanisms of stablecoins have changed since 2017 and we're going to start classifying stablecoins into four different categories:

&gt;Check the previous newsletter if you want more clarity.

1. Mechanisms
2. Peg
3. Collateral Amount
4. Collateral Type

# MakerDAO

In MakerDAO’s ecosystem, $DAI is the stablecoin and uses a dual token and reserve mechanism. It is soft pegged to one dollar and uses over-collateralisation to get that one dollar. It uses different kinds of on-chain crypto assets like $ETH, stablecoins, and non-stablecoins.

## Dual Token Mechanism

In the dual token model, as the name suggests, there are two tokens in the system. The primary token is stablecoin $DAI which is soft pegged to the US dollar. The secondary token is $MKR. The main function of the secondary token is to absorb volatility in the system. Think of $DAI as your output which is stable and has low volatility, but because there will always be volatility within the system or outside of the system. The volatility needs to go somewhere, so it goes to the other token, $MKR.

## Functions of the MKR Token

This is a utility token and functions as a governance token for voting. It can be used to pay off interest accrued in the system, and during insolvency. During crashes or different kinds of liquidation $MKR can be minted and sold for $DAI in the ecosystem. $MKR is a crucial aspect of governing the entire system of $DAI. $DAI is the facilitator that allows people to exchange goods and services. A few months ago MakerDAO moved more of its funds towards the DAO which means that it is no longer mainly controlled by the founders and is now controlled by the community.

## Reserve Mechanism

This means that the stablecoin or the $DAI is backed by reserves and you can use the $DAI to redeem the underlying collateral. You can redeem $DAI for the underlying crypto assets that you deposited to get $DAI initially.

# Creating $DAI: How it Works

You can create $DAI in three simple steps:

1. You have to own the asset.
2. You deposit that asset into a vault.
3. Based on the amount of value in the vault you can mint some $DAI out and then can use it in some other system.

The only thing that you have to be careful about is the minimum collateralisation ratio. If I have $150 worth of $ETH and I put it in my vault then I can take out a maximum of 100 $DAI from this vault and spend it somewhere else. My $150 worth of $ETH sits in the vault. I cannot touch it until I repay the amount that I borrowed, which is 100 $DAI.

## What happens when your $ETH falls in value?

I put $150 worth of $ETH in the vault but if the value falls to $100 then my collateralisation ratio is 100% which is less than the ideal amount of 150%. Now I will have to either repay the loan (instead of borrowing 100 $DAI I must repay 33 $DAI) or I will have to add $50 worth of $ETH into the collateral so that the minimum collateralisation ratio or the *c-ratio* is balanced. **TLDR:**MakerDAO is a novel and innovative protocol that allows for on-chain collateralised borrowing, while also creating a reasonably effective stablecoin. This gives the crypto community an alternative to fiat-backed stablecoins like $USDT. Furthermore, $MKR holders continue to make continual improvements to the protocol, so it is very likely that the risks we have outlined could largely be mitigated in the future."

# General Conclusion

MakerDAO is one of the core project on DeFi. The foundation of the project is built on the Ethereum blockchain. The two main components are $DAI (stablecoin) and $MKR (governance). The protocol creates $DAI that is backed by $ETH using a vault mechanism.This system is able to regulate and stabilise the price of $DAI stablecoin. This protocol is also the first successful onchain reserve stablecoin.

Everybody’s doing fractional co-ownership projects these days, or turning physical art into an NFT, but OMNIA is more than that. OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here’s how they do that

• Making high value assets easily accessible &amp; investable, lowering entry point for wealth creation

\* Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked 

\* Focusing on indexing before derivatives

\* Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age

\* Liquidity for the middle class

Here’s how it works:

• $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate ready to tokenise with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022

• 3 Tokens (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin)

• Unique business model (Token price is linked with how successful the business is)

• 10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go)

• Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)

They’ve been building in super stealth mode until earlier this month, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan. 

• Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK

• Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney

• Recent coverage in The Capital- more press in the coming weeks 

• Certified GDPR practitioner, focusing majority of her time on compliance

Other than lowering the barrier for wealth creation, the Omnia DeFi tokens can serve as the blockchain layer of infrastructure for many developing nations! (The modern day equivalent of building railroads or highways) Think Google but for indexing real world assets that can be traded. 

Omnia DeFi will be getting full regulatory approval before creating OAT asset tokens.

Furthermore the OMINA DeFi team will reply to any question you have regarding the business, they’re so transparent!

OMNIA’S potential far surpasses popular cryptocurrencies. 🗻 Entering one of the largest undisrupted markets with less than 1% being digitised to date. Think about how disruptive Google or Uber was to the traditional markets🗳 

Charitas’ community is attentive to global events and pivots to raise money for disaster relief. 🌋 With their newest team members putting together processes to vet and onboard charities to their platform, they will be the premier charity token. 

THEY ARE THE CRYPTO BUILT FOR CHARITY FOR A REASON.

Furthermore their commitment to social impact is really good to see, I dont know about you guys but I got into the space because of the equality, fairness and empowerment crypto brings to us… OMNIA does just that

Marnotaur recently held an AMA session with GAINS. Our team gave answers to some interesting queries about the platform, held a quiz for the community and replied to questions asked by the community on social media. 

GAINS is the only crypto community to provide both events that involve interaction with crypto companies and investment opportunities. These events give us a chance to understand the crypto and blockchain space better and help us to make more educated investment decisions. The main events are usually AMAs (Ask Me Anything) and quizzes. Communication and connection with people is at the heart of human nature, that’s why GAINS decided to hold an AMA session with their audience. 

## Marnotaur AMA session results

During the AMA session, the Marnotaur team answered several questions about the platform. First of all, GAINS asked about our project and our team, specifically what experience it had before crypto. We were also asked about raising funds, the development stage and the value of our ecosystem. 

The answers to these questions gave us an opportunity to share information about the Marnotaur protocol and its design. During the session, we explained that Marnotaur is a liquidity protocol that allows traders, farmers and liquidity providers to multiply their gains. Our project is self-funded and we are now working with MakerDAO to launch an IDO on BSC and the launch of a Community Round to reward our first users. $TAUR is the utility token of the Marnotaur platform and it has several uses: as rewards for providing liquidity, staking and farming, as well as powering platform governance.

In addition to the AMA session, there was a special quiz. A quiz is basically a reverse AMA: the project team asks questions about the product, technology, strategy and more. AMA session participants answer these questions, usually whilst joking and chatting together. The quiz consisted of 4 questions. The questions were about Marnotaur: what it is; what chains it will support; if there are any trade restrictions; what actions are not available on the platform and so on. Our team also replied to several questions posted on Twitter.

## About GAINS

GAINS started over 2 years ago and is now one of the biggest and most respected crypto communities. The project has raised several million dollars for many ICOs and has organized lots of events with companies. At these events, you can: learn more about crypto and blockchain; share and discuss your ideas; and compete for prizes (sometimes worth over $1,000) by asking questions or sharing your knowledge. GAINS members have the opportunity to invest in the latest and best crypto projects. You can track all your investments easily with GAINS. 

GAINS believes in quality over quantity, they always offer much fewer deals but of much higher quality. They have a community of several thousand members on Telegram and Discord. After joining, you will be able to discuss ideas, projects and crypto in general with experienced crypto enthusiasts who are ready to help you better understand this complex ecosystem.

They are pegged to the native currency they are meant to represent and that should be the end of it. 

Right? 

**Unfortunately not quite.** Haha. I'm like Dr. Suess. 

Not all Stablecoins are created equal, and I'm here today to talk to you about what makes each of our most boring crypto investments special. 

**USDC** 

USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions, backed by fully reserved assets, redeemable on a 1:1 basis for US dollars, and governed by Centre, a membership-based consortium that sets technical, policy and financial standards for stablecoins. USDC boasts the ""largest Stablecoin ecosystem"" used by hundreds of companies, exchanges, Defi protocols, etc. 

With 27.3 Billion in circulation, USDC is massive. It's a Coinbase darling, and it's widely used and accepted as the Stablecoin standard. 

USDC is largely backed, so it wouldn't have a Tether situation. Which for those who don't know is the FED of crypto. Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. 

**DAI** 

My personal favorite. 

The first decentralized, collateral-backed Stablecoin, DAI maintains a 1:1 value with the US dollar by locking other cryptocurrencies into contracts. 

This means that unlike other asset-backed cryptocurrencies, which may be issued by for-profit companies, DAI is the product of an open-source software called the Maker Protocol, a decentralized application running on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

As such, DAI maintains its value not by being backed by U.S. dollars custodied by a company, but by using collateralized debt denominated in Ethereum. 

**How DAI works**

The Maker Protocol, through smart contracts running on Ethereum, enables borrowers to lock ETH and other crypto assets, thus collateralizing it, in order to generate new DAI tokens in the form of loans. 

If borrowers wish to recover the locked ETH, they will have to return the DAI to the protocol and pay a fee. In the event of liquidation, the Maker Protocol will take the collateral and sell it using an internal market-based auction mechanism.

If users want to acquire DAI, they can spend ETH to purchase the dollar equivalent amount in DAI on an exchange or they can collateralize ETH and other assets using the Maker Protocol. 

The latter method allows users who do not want to sell their assets to still acquire DAI.

Collateralized Debt positions 

Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs) are the smart contracts on the Maker Protocol that users can leverage to lock their collateral assets (i.e., ETH or BAT) and generate DAI. 

CDPs can be thought of as secure vaults for storing the aforementioned collateral. To account for the volatility in the crypto collateral, DAI is often over-collateralized, meaning that the deposit amount required is typically higher than the value of DAI.

For example, users must spend $200 in ETH in order to receive $100 DAI, which is meant to account for the potential decrease in the value ETH. As a result, if ETH depreciates by 25%, the $100 in DAI would still be safely collateralized by $150 in ETH. 

In order to recover the stored ETH, the user has to return the DAI and pay a stability fee.



**Supply the DAI** 

Due to its design, the supply of DAI cannot be altered by any party in the network. Rather, it is maintained through a system of smart contracts designed to dynamically respond to changes in the market price of the assets in its contracts. Again, avoiding a Tether situation. 

DAI was founded in 2014 by the foundation that would become MakerDAO, launching officially in 2017.

**Tether**

I’ve heard it’s over-collateralized and that MakerDAO regulates it and that’s all great, but can I effectively treat putting cash into DAI for staking as putting it into a savings account with crazy high interest? Of course, I know that’s not what it is and there are risks, but how big are those risks? Is it realistically possible for DAI to get “unpegged” from $1.00?"

Find out what are the main DeFi networks available in the cryptocurrency market,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReefDeFi/comments/pbskb4/find_out_what_are_the_main_defi_networks/,yokesh351,1,2021-08-26 12:53:20,3,/r/ReefDeFi/comments/pbskb4/find_out_what_are_the_main_defi_networks/,NaN,"As already presented in other series, the universe of decentralized finance (DeFi) is quite wide. With this, the investor can have access to a wide range of financial services and products and even investments in works of art, such as NFT. However, what are the most secure and reliable DeFi protocols on this market? Many DeFi protocols have come under attack throughout 2021. This type of failure often causes both direct token theft and massive price devaluation. In either case, the investor can suffer huge losses if he invests in an unknown or poorly secure protocol.

Therefore, this text will present the main networks and protocols that exist in the DeFi market. Through them, it will be possible to start your research and investments with more security and practicality. In this text, we are going to know and understand more about these protocols, the most known of which are the following:

* AAVE ;
* Maker ;
* Compound ;
* Curve Finance;
* Synthetix ;
* Chainlink ;
* Uniswap .

Main DeFi Networks and Protocol Types Currently, most DeFi protocols basically work on two networks: Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Other networks, such as Chainlink (LINK) and Cardano (ADA) are taking their first steps, but they still do not have large shares of this market. Generally speaking, DeFi protocols can be divided into the following categories:

* loan protocols;
* Yield Farming Protocols;
* Decentralized Exchanges (DEX);
* Asset tokenization;
* Arts and NFTs negotiation;
* Derivatives.

As presented in the first text in this series, one way to see which DeFi projects are safer is through the Total Allocated Value (TLV). The projects with the most money allocated from this list are also often the most used and safest. Therefore, they are the ones we will see later in this text.

In addition, it is important to assess which platforms are most sought after by investors. The aforementioned DeFi Pulse website, for example, brings the projects in order of TLV and also by categories. It is possible to deduce from the table below that, among other things, the most sought after modality by investors in DeFi is loans. After all, five of the ten protocols with the highest TLV are focused on this modality.

After loans, decentralized exchanges (DEX) appear with three projects among the largest. That is, 80% of the largest DeFi protocols are exchanges or borrowing platforms. Therefore, the great demand of investors is for 1) platforms that make it possible to receive returns on capital, and; 2) places to trade DeFi tokens.

Most of these projects run on Ethereum, the network that pioneered the popularization of DeFi and smart contracts. However, other networks have shown growth and, as a result, have stolen market shares. The main one, let's get to know the best known and most valuable projects within the [development of Ethereum ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development)network.

## AAVE

AAVE is a liquidity protocol that allows investors to earn interest by borrowing their cryptoactives . This protocol is non-custodial, that is, the borrowed crypto actives are under the custody of their owner and not of AAVE. In addition, the platform is decentralized and open source.

The protocol supports borrowing with various tokens, including stablecoins and other DeFi tokens. In this sense, AAVE brings a new investment option, especially for long-term holders. With the protocol, these investors can place their tokens to earn interest, thus generating passive income.

In this process, the entire operation is done through the connection of the wallets with the AAVE protocol. Thus, there is no need to transfer ownership of the tokens to a platform or place them in the custody of third parties. As there are no deposits, the protocol has no funds that can be stolen by hackers, for example

In other words, the AAVE is a safe way to create savings or passive income with cryptocurrencies. Interest rates are usually attractive, in many cases exceeding the double digits per year, and mostly compound interest. This is currently the largest DeFi protocol in terms of allocated value, with over $19 billion.

## Maker (MKR)

The MKR is the token that feeds the Maker, also known as the MakerDAO. As the name implies, MakerDAO functions as an Autonomous Decentralized Organization (DAO). In turn, this network is responsible for managing and issuing one of the best known stablecoins on the market: DAI.

DAI, in turn, is a stablecoin native to the DeFi market. Like the protocol, DAI is decentralized and, unlike centralized stablecoins like USDT and USDC, does not have a central company or issuer. Therefore, network tokens cannot be confiscated or blocked.

Within the DeFi ecosystem, DAI serves as a way for investors to obtain a stable currency without having to sell their cryptocurrencies. For example, imagine an investor who has Ether ( ETH ), needs to borrow money, but doesn't want to get rid of his cryptocurrencies. He can borrow dollars via DAI, using his ETH tokens as collateral.

With this, the investor can use his position in ETH to obtain dollars via DAI. Such an operation has two clear advantages. The first is that there is no need to sell ETH. The second is a consequence of the first, since, by not selling the tokens, the investor will not have to pay capital gain taxes and other fees that could be charged in the transaction.

In addition, the MKR and DAI can be borrowed on multiple platforms, earning interest to their holders. The protocol was conceived in 2015 and launched in 2017. Since then, both the network and stablecoin have grown exponentially in value, reaching, at the time of writing this text, US$ 7.35 billion in allocated value.

## Compound (COMP)

Compound is another protocol that operates in the loans and interest segment. You can borrow or borrow up to 14 tokens, including stablecoins and DeFi tokens. The platform was also launched in 2018 and, since then, it has grown significantly both in use and in allocated value.

There are a number of liquidity pools in Compound and you can invest in one or more of them. When making this loan, the platform gives in exchange cTokens, which represent the amount invested. If you want to redeem your capital, the investor sells these tokens and redeems the invested capital.

Each token has its cToken version. Thus, whoever applies ETH in the protocol receives cETH, USDT applications yield cUSDT, and so on. Over time, the exchange rate of these cTokens against the underlying crypto-asset increases, and the investor can redeem them for more than the amount initially invested. This is how the protocol distributes your interest, whose fees can be seen on the website itself.

## Uniswap (UNI)

Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX) is a protocol used to exchange tokens created in the Ethereum blockchain. These exchanges are carried out in an automated way through smart contracts. Created in 2020, Uniswap saw its popularity explode along with DeFi and the launch of the UNI token in 2020.

As a DEX, Uniswap does not hold custody of any token traded on the platform. For trades to take place, the platform has people who use their tokens to provide liquidity to each traded pair. They are known as liquidity providers.

In exchange for providing liquidity, providers are rewarded with part of the fees charged by Uniswap. In this sense, DEX pays only transaction fees charged by the platform. In other words, trading through Uniswap provides lower costs and, with automation, more agility in operations.

## Yearn.finance (YFI)

The yearn.finance protocol was one of the first to take advantage of the rise of DeFi. It acts as an investment aggregator that enables investors to seek the best yields on the market. The protocol uses automation to always find the highest rates, boosting profitability for liquidity providers.

The project was launched in February 2020 and was an almost immediate success. In just three months, the YFI token came to cost US$ 82,745, a historic high reached in May. By way of comparison, the BTC cost $8,804 at the same time. In other words, YFI was worth almost ten times more than the main cryptocurrency on the market.

Even today, yearn.finance is one of the best known DeFi income projects. Although it lost space, the protocol made history by calling attention to the advantages of the DeFi market. Besides, of course, it was one of the few tokens in history that managed to surpass the unit value of BTC.

## Synthetix (SNX)

The name Synthetix comes from the English word Synthetic, which means synthetic. The word itself was a great inspiration for what the platform does: creating synthetic assets. In other words, Synthetix creates tokens that represent real assets such as stocks, derivatives, or even cryptocurrencies.

The network was launched in 2017 through Ethereum, but gained prominence from 2020. The protocol works through synths, synthetic assets that can replicate almost anything, from the price of oil and cryptocurrencies to the highest stock indexes in the world .

Synths track and provide returns based on the underlying asset without requiring the investor to directly hold the asset. In this way, Synthetix provides access to traditional market investments through tokenization. The protocol has advantages such as security, 24-hour operation and fast liquidity.

Other DeFi Networks So far, the protocols seen in this text have been built on Ethereum, which is, in fact, the main core network for DeFi. However, Ethereum also has its limitations, especially in the high price of fees, which brought difficulties for small investors. In this sense, other DeFi networks started to gain space in the market.

Networks like Polygon – formerly Matic – seek to increase the scalability of Ethereum and have grown in value. Others, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), have lower rates as one of their differentials. As a result, projects with less capital can run their operations without having to worry that network congestion will increase transaction prices.

Recently, BSC broke its daily transaction record by reaching more than 12 million transactions on July 29, 2021. The amount was almost ten times greater than transactions handled by Ethereum on the same day, as shown in the chart below. This achievement demonstrates not only the growth of the network, but the demand that still exists in the DeFi market.

Finally, the [development of the DeFi](https://www.blockchainx.tech/decentralized-finance-defi-development) ecosystem is quite broad, which means that new projects are always popping up. At the same time, protocols that seemed promising disappear or lose relevance. Keeping up to date and paying attention to which networks are more or less secure is essential for investors to be able to keep their capital protected and, at the same time, not be left out of this great revolution."

As a result, projects with less capital can run their operations without having to worry that network congestion will increase transaction prices.

Recently, BSC broke its daily transaction record by reaching more than 12 million transactions on July 29, 2021. The amount was almost ten times greater than transactions handled by Ethereum on the same day, as shown in the chart below. This achievement demonstrates not only the growth of the network, but the demand that still exists in the DeFi market.

With this, the investor can have access to a wide range of financial services and products and even investments in works of art, such as NFT. However, what are the most secure and reliable DeFi protocols on this market? Many DeFi protocols have come under attack throughout 2021. This type of failure often causes both direct token theft and massive price devaluation. In either case, the investor can suffer huge losses if he invests in an unknown or poorly secure protocol.

Therefore, this text will present the main networks and protocols that exist in the DeFi market. Through them, it will be possible to start your research and investments with more security and practicality. In this text, we are going to know and understand more about these protocols, the most known of which are the following:

* AAVE ;
* Maker ;
* Compound ;
* Curve Finance;
* Synthetix ;
* Chainlink ;
* Uniswap .

Main DeFi Networks and Protocol Types Currently, most DeFi protocols basically work on two networks: Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Other networks, such as Chainlink (LINK) and Cardano (ADA) are taking their first steps, but they still do not have large shares of this market. Generally speaking, DeFi protocols can be divided into the following categories:

* loan protocols;
* Yield Farming Protocols;
* Decentralized Exchanges (DEX);
* Asset tokenization;
* Arts and NFTs negotiation;
* Derivatives.

As presented in the first text in this series, one way to see which DeFi projects are safer is through the Total Allocated Value (TLV). The projects with the most money allocated from this list are also often the most used and safest. Therefore, they are the ones we will see later in this text.

In addition, it is important to assess which platforms are most sought after by investors. The aforementioned DeFi Pulse website, for example, brings the projects in order of TLV and also by categories. It is possible to deduce from the table below that, among other things, the most sought after modality by investors in DeFi is loans. After all, five of the ten protocols with the highest TLV are focused on this modality.

After loans, decentralized exchanges (DEX) appear with three projects among the largest. That is, 80% of the largest DeFi protocols are exchanges or borrowing platforms. Therefore, the great demand of investors is for 1) platforms that make it possible to receive returns on capital, and; 2) places to trade DeFi tokens.

Most of these projects run on Ethereum, the network that pioneered the popularization of DeFi and smart contracts. However, other networks have shown growth and, as a result, have stolen market shares. The main one, let's get to know the best known and most valuable projects within the [development of Ethereum ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development)network.

## AAVE

AAVE is a liquidity protocol that allows investors to earn interest by borrowing their cryptoactives . This protocol is non-custodial, that is, the borrowed crypto actives are under the custody of their owner and not of AAVE. In addition, the platform is decentralized and open source.

The protocol supports borrowing with various tokens, including stablecoins and other DeFi tokens. In this sense, AAVE brings a new investment option, especially for long-term holders. With the protocol, these investors can place their tokens to earn interest, thus generating passive income.

In this process, the entire operation is done through the connection of the wallets with the AAVE protocol. Thus, there is no need to transfer ownership of the tokens to a platform or place them in the custody of third parties. As there are no deposits, the protocol has no funds that can be stolen by hackers, for example

In other words, the AAVE is a safe way to create savings or passive income with cryptocurrencies. Interest rates are usually attractive, in many cases exceeding the double digits per year, and mostly compound interest. This is currently the largest DeFi protocol in terms of allocated value, with over $19 billion.

## Maker (MKR)

The MKR is the token that feeds the Maker, also known as the MakerDAO. As the name implies, MakerDAO functions as an Autonomous Decentralized Organization (DAO). In turn, this network is responsible for managing and issuing one of the best known stablecoins on the market: DAI.

DAI, in turn, is a stablecoin native to the DeFi market. Like the protocol, DAI is decentralized and, unlike centralized stablecoins like USDT and USDC, does not have a central company or issuer. Therefore, network tokens cannot be confiscated or blocked.

Within the DeFi ecosystem, DAI serves as a way for investors to obtain a stable currency without having to sell their cryptocurrencies. For example, imagine an investor who has Ether ( ETH ), needs to borrow money, but doesn't want to get rid of his cryptocurrencies. He can borrow dollars via DAI, using his ETH tokens as collateral.

With this, the investor can use his position in ETH to obtain dollars via DAI. Such an operation has two clear advantages. The first is that there is no need to sell ETH. The second is a consequence of the first, since, by not selling the tokens, the investor will not have to pay capital gain taxes and other fees that could be charged in the transaction.

In addition, the MKR and DAI can be borrowed on multiple platforms, earning interest to their holders. The protocol was conceived in 2015 and launched in 2017. Since then, both the network and stablecoin have grown exponentially in value, reaching, at the time of writing this text, US$ 7.35 billion in allocated value.

## Compound (COMP)

Compound is another protocol that operates in the loans and interest segment. You can borrow or borrow up to 14 tokens, including stablecoins and DeFi tokens. The platform was also launched in 2018 and, since then, it has grown significantly both in use and in allocated value.

There are a number of liquidity pools in Compound and you can invest in one or more of them. When making this loan, the platform gives in exchange cTokens, which represent the amount invested. If you want to redeem your capital, the investor sells these tokens and redeems the invested capital.

Each token has its cToken version. Thus, whoever applies ETH in the protocol receives cETH, USDT applications yield cUSDT, and so on. Over time, the exchange rate of these cTokens against the underlying crypto-asset increases, and the investor can redeem them for more than the amount initially invested. This is how the protocol distributes your interest, whose fees can be seen on the website itself.

## Uniswap (UNI)

Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX) is a protocol used to exchange tokens created in the Ethereum blockchain. These exchanges are carried out in an automated way through smart contracts. Created in 2020, Uniswap saw its popularity explode along with DeFi and the launch of the UNI token in 2020.

As a DEX, Uniswap does not hold custody of any token traded on the platform. For trades to take place, the platform has people who use their tokens to provide liquidity to each traded pair. They are known as liquidity providers.

In exchange for providing liquidity, providers are rewarded with part of the fees charged by Uniswap. In this sense, DEX pays only transaction fees charged by the platform. In other words, trading through Uniswap provides lower costs and, with automation, more agility in operations.

## Yearn.finance (YFI)

The yearn.finance protocol was one of the first to take advantage of the rise of DeFi. It acts as an investment aggregator that enables investors to seek the best yields on the market. The protocol uses automation to always find the highest rates, boosting profitability for liquidity providers.

The project was launched in February 2020 and was an almost immediate success. In just three months, the YFI token came to cost US$ 82,745, a historic high reached in May. By way of comparison, the BTC cost $8,804 at the same time. In other words, YFI was worth almost ten times more than the main cryptocurrency on the market.

Even today, yearn.finance is one of the best known DeFi income projects. Although it lost space, the protocol made history by calling attention to the advantages of the DeFi market. Besides, of course, it was one of the few tokens in history that managed to surpass the unit value of BTC.

## Synthetix (SNX)

The name Synthetix comes from the English word Synthetic, which means synthetic. The word itself was a great inspiration for what the platform does: creating synthetic assets. In other words, Synthetix creates tokens that represent real assets such as stocks, derivatives, or even cryptocurrencies.

The network was launched in 2017 through Ethereum, but gained prominence from 2020. The protocol works through synths, synthetic assets that can replicate almost anything, from the price of oil and cryptocurrencies to the highest stock indexes in the world .

Synths track and provide returns based on the underlying asset without requiring the investor to directly hold the asset. In this way, Synthetix provides access to traditional market investments through tokenization. The protocol has advantages such as security, 24-hour operation and fast liquidity.

Other DeFi Networks So far, the protocols seen in this text have been built on Ethereum, which is, in fact, the main core network for DeFi. However, Ethereum also has its limitations, especially in the high price of fees, which brought difficulties for small investors. In this sense, other DeFi networks started to gain space in the market.

Networks like Polygon – formerly Matic – seek to increase the scalability of Ethereum and have grown in value. Others, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), have lower rates as one of their differentials. As a result, projects with less capital can run their operations without having to worry that network congestion will increase transaction prices.

We are glad to present you with a summary of the recent AMA session Marnotaur held on August 24th with CryptoKudasaiJP - a Japanese Blockchain KOL community and investment group. The AMA session included several preset questions and a live Q&amp;A. During the session, the Marnotaur team answered questions about its technologies, top milestones, the $TAUR utility token, current partnerships and main goals. 

**What we talked about**

We started the AMA session by introducing our project and team. We informed the audience that the Marnotaur team consists of 10 IT specialists and more than 15 specialists from other fields. We also explained the advantages of project Marnotaur, such as the distribution of liquidation fees to stakeholders, liquidity provision, leverage of up to 5x and the rebalancing of leveraged positions.

Then we were asked about our notable technologies and we explained that our team had developed a liquidity protocol for secure margin with insufficient collateral. 

There was a question about Marnotaur’s top milestones and we discussed the fact that we have already developed a mechanism for Shadow staking native tokens and smart contracts, for liquidity pools and for opening leveraged positions. We also completed the Chainlink price integration, the Rinkeby testnet and rebranded ‘5x Margin Tool’ to ‘Marnotaur’. We also shared our main goals for this year - the successful launch of the platform and increasing the number of platforms, pools and projects we offer. And we said that any obstacles we faced were overcome successfully. 

Then we had an opportunity to talk about our utility token $TAUR. This token will be used for rewarding liquidity providers, stakeholders, farmers and it will be used for the platform’s governance. We also have a Buy &amp; Burn program that reduces the number of tokens in circulation and makes the token more valuable.

The Marnotaur team shared part of its marketing strategy: to create local communities supported by local KOLs and our support team, which we have already achieved. Moreover, we have formed many partnerships that are helping us to develop and promote the product. We were delighted to list some of our partnerships with strategic investors such as 7percent Ventures, Avalaunch, OneMax, Hyperion Decimus, GAINS Associates, Follow the Seed, DCAP, Lemonode, Mars Academy and many others. 

In addition, we were asked about the team’s source revenue and investors. We explained that our project is self-funded but that we plan to raise funds from large Venture Capitals. Right now, we are working with MakerDAO to launch our IDO on BSC. 

There was a question about hacking and security and we gladly shared that our platform is preparing to release a testnet for our community. The security of funds will be guaranteed by decentralized smart contracts, which have been audited and found to be reliable. We also mentioned that the smart contracts will be open-source. 

Then we answered several questions posed by the community in the chat group. Our team was asked about leveraged trading and we were pleased to explain how it works. First of all, the platform generates a personal smart contract when you make your first deposit. This contract works as a remote wallet, which automatically borrows funds in the same currency that you deposit. After that, you can start trading on our platform but you can’t withdraw funds until you repay the loan to the liquidity provider that you borrowed funds from. 5x leverage will be available for the first stage of the project and in the future, we are planning to increase it. 

We also had a great opportunity to share the reasons why you should choose us. First of all, to take advantage of leverage, you shouldn’t go through KYC/AML or perform other actions. Moreover, we will have unique features such as liquidation revenue sharing, capital efficiency, cross-chain support and popular DEX integrations.

Then there was a question about liquidity keepers and we explained that every trader in the system has a person who helps them avoid losses by closing positions in a timely manner. Each keeper has an opportunity to receive rewards for liquidating positions. Since Marnotaur is part of the DeFi family, our Liquidity Keepers are always ready to liquidate positions if the initial margin is not enough to cover the loan and its interest. We are doing everything we can for the safety of our liquidity providers. 

In addition, we mentioned that for beginners as well as professional traders, there is a lot of educational content on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MarnotaurMarginTrading).

## About Marnotaur

Marnotaur is a liquidity protocol for secure under-collateralized margin that allows traders, farmers, liquidity providers and keepers to increase their profits. Marnotaur allows traders to deposit their funds in a smart contract and then trade on a DEX with 5x leverage, which is nearly 250% higher than current DeFi margin standards.

It’s been on everyone’s lips for quite some time now, and it reflects the idea of decentralization better than pretty much anything that came before it. We are talking about Decentralized Finance or called DeFi for short. It’s an idea on which big-name projects such as the decentralized lending platform MakerDAO are already built and celebrate great success. But there is so much more behind DeFi. It’s an entire ecosystem. Credit protocols, security coins, stablecoins, derivatives, exchanges, and much more adorn the wonderful world of DeFi. Sound interesting? Then wait and see because DeFi has so much more to offer.

In this article, we will clarify the most important question of all: what is DeFi? Then, we’ll introduce you to the vision behind it all. We will explain what DeFi is all about and which promising projects are already working on it at full speed. As always, it’s worth staying tuned because this will be not only educational but also exciting.

**What is DeFi?**

DeFi is essentially just a conventional financial instrument built on a blockchain. Primarily, the Ethereum blockchain is used for this purpose. DeFi applications are mostly based on open-source protocols for creating and issuing digital assets. Their advantage, among others, is that they are designed to offer notable benefits of operating on a public blockchain, such as censorship resistance and improved access to financial services. In this way, the DeFi movement addresses an important core criterion of cryptocurrencies, and that is the promise of making money and its transaction universally accessible. And that is for every person, no matter where he or she lives in the world.

The DeFi movement takes this promise even a step further. It aims to provide a global, open alternative to every financial service available today. These include the ability

· to save,

· take out loans,

· trade,

· take out insurance

and much more. All that is needed is a smartphone or computer with an internet connection.

This makes it possible to use smart contracts. Those who have already read our knowledge article about Ethereum already know that smart contracts are self-executing contracts. These make it possible to develop far more sophisticated functions than simply automating the sending and receiving of cryptocurrencies. Such decentralized applications are called dApps.

· In the context of DeFi, dApps already exist that can

· The creation of stablecoins,

· the completion of a credit transaction

· executing automated advanced investment strategies.

· What makes DeFi different from the traditional financial system?

The key question, of course, is why use these DeFi-dApps at all? After all, traditional banking or Wall Street counterparts already exist for all of these products mentioned. Unfortunately, this is only true in certain parts of the world. There is also the following difference. At their core, dApps and their associated business processes are not managed by a company, institution, or individual. Instead, the processes are automatic, and the associated rules are hardcoded in the smart contract. There, they are visible to all and transparently represented in the form of code.

Once the smart contract is implemented on the blockchain, it can execute itself with little or no human intervention. DeFi-dApps are thus visible to everyone but pseudonymous. They cannot be directly assigned to the real identity of the user. DeFi-dApps can be used from anywhere in the world where an internet connection is available. They are censorship-resistant and, thanks to the automated execution of the smart contracts and the visible code, conclude contracts and/or their use trustworthy and transparent, even without intermediaries.

Not without reason, DeFi is currently one of the fastest-growing sectors in the crypto field. More than $600 million worth of cryptocurrencies have already been invested in smart contracts in question, and thus in infrastructure. What exactly are some of the most important and popular use cases and projects in the DeFi sector, let’s take a closer look now.

**1. open credit protocols — accessible to everyone**

Open credit protocols have probably attracted more attention recently than any other category in the field of DeFi on Ethereum. Largely due to the meteoric rise in Dai's use and other P2P protocols like Dharma and the creation of liquidity pools like Compound Finance, decentralized lending is garnering powerful attention, and rightfully so. Open, decentralized lending offers numerous advantages over traditional lending structures. It enables

· The integration of lending/borrowing of digital assets,

· the insurance of digital assets,

· instant transaction processing and new methods of secured lending,

· broader access to people who are unable to access traditional services

· standardization and interoperability, which can reduce costs through automation.

Secured lending using open protocols such as MakerDAO and Dharma are designed to minimize the need for trust. They achieve this by making use of the functionality of Ethereum-based smart contracts. Open protocol lending is entirely confined to the public blockchain and has some intriguing long-term implications for expanding financial inclusion worldwide. MakerDAO is the most well-known decentralized lending protocol.

**2. issuance platforms and investment**

Issuing platforms encompass a wide range of platforms, including multiple exchanges that simultaneously serve as issuing media. A significant portion of issuance platforms are in the security token space.

Well-known security token issuance platforms such as Polymath and Harbor provide issuers with the framework, tools, and resources to launch security tokens on a blockchain. They are preparing their own standardized token contracts for securities (i.e., ST-20 and R-Tokens) that allow for automated compliance and customizable trading parameters to meet regulatory requirements. Besides, they are similarly integrated with service providers such as broker-dealers, legal entities, and others to assist issuers in their process. Dual exchange/issuance platforms include Overstock’s tZERO, for example.

Issuance platforms and investment management systems are likely to grow rapidly in importance as more participants enter the open finance world while providing growth for the DeFi ecosystem.

**3. decentralized betting platforms**

Decentralized betting platforms are among the more compelling components of open finance that are highly complex but offer tremendous potential. Augur launched a censorship-resistant platform based on Ethereum last year that allows people to bet on just about anything. Other projects, such as Gnosis, are aiming for something similar.

Betting platforms, or prediction markets, have long been popular financial tools for hedging risk and speculating worldwide events. Decentralized prediction markets enable the same thing, but with cryptocurrencies and without the ability to censor the markets. Everything from political and weather forecasts to hedging all kinds of risks on financial or adverse events in the real world is already offered in Augur.

**4. exchanges and open marketplaces**

The role of exchanges is fulfilled by decentralized exchanges (DEX). A DEX is a P2P marketplace for assets on Ethereum between two parties, where no third party acts as an intermediary in a transaction. Thus, they differ from centralized exchanges like Coinbase &amp; Co. in this respect. Some DEX also uses some highly innovative methods of exchanging tokens such as atomic swaps and other non-depository means of exchanging one asset for another with minimal settlement time and risk.

Other types of open marketplaces focus on exchanging non-fungible tokens (NFTs), often referred to as crypto-collectibles. Platforms such as OpenSea and Rarebits facilitate the search and buy/sell of crypto assets ranging from NFTs in games such as Cryptokitties to virtual land parcels in the game Decentraland. Some marketplaces, such as District0X, are even said to allow users to create their own exchanges and vote on management procedures. Current examples of dexs that offer cryptocurrency trading include Binance DEX and Ether Delta.­

**5. stablecoins**

Stablecoins now come in a wide variety of models. They differ in part in how they issue coins, how their reserves are checked, and the mechanism for fixing their price. Stablecoins are tokens issued by a blockchain that are intended to maintain a stable value. There usually is a peg to an external asset such as USD, gold, or others to achieve this. Roughly, the following 3 categories can be distinguished in stablecoins:

1. Crypto collateralized

2. Fiat collateralized

3. Non-collateralized

Crypto collateralized stable coins include Maker’s Dai. Fiat-backed stablecoins, however, are by far the most popular stablecoins on the market. First and foremost is Tether, although there are now numerous alternatives. The models for these stablecoins do not differ much from each other. With all of them, users have to trust the providers. Some offer regular and voluntary audits to create the necessary trust through transparency.

Unsecured stablecoins are neither centralized nor backed by crypto assets. They are built on an algorithm to maintain a stable value. To put it simply, the algorithm considers supply and demand as parameters and adjusts them accordingly, always to keep them in a balanced ratio. The basis was the pioneer in this category but failed due to regulatory concerns. As a result, the project was scrapped.

**The future of DeFi — potential or all hype?**

The final question, of course, is how great the potential of the whole DeFi movement is? Basically, it can be stated that there are many things in the field of cryptocurrencies that are simply overhyped. The immeasurable potential is attributed to the vision so that the actual product has no chance at all to live up to the exaggerated expectations. What follows is severe disillusionment and disinterest. However, with DeFi, it is a bit different because there are already some finished products like MakerDao, and the market has received them well.

Nevertheless, we are still in a very early phase of the whole DeFi movement. However, the potential behind it is huge. Even if only one spate of DeFi, such as Lending, were to succeed in the future, that is already more than enough. If the DeFi ecosystem can offer loans at better conditions than most national banks and other lending institutions, this could lead to global adoption.

But this is also where we are already at one of the biggest hurdles that the DeFi sector still has to overcome. For one thing, more education is needed so that the masses even know that this alternative exists. As before, only a tiny percentage is even concerned with the issues surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Even fewer deal with the DeFi sector in particular or have even heard of it. On the other hand, the user-friendliness of such products must be improved enormously to set the necessary course for the broad masses to use it and for global adoption to take place."

*The ecosystem behind Decentralized Finance explained simply*

It’s been on everyone’s lips for quite some time now, and it reflects the idea of decentralization better than pretty much anything that came before it. We are talking about Decentralized Finance or called DeFi for short. It’s an idea on which big-name projects such as the decentralized lending platform MakerDAO are already built and celebrate great success. But there is so much more behind DeFi. It’s an entire ecosystem. Credit protocols, security coins, stablecoins, derivatives, exchanges, and much more adorn the wonderful world of DeFi. Sound interesting? Then wait and see because DeFi has so much more to offer.

In this article, we will clarify the most important question of all: what is DeFi? Then, we’ll introduce you to the vision behind it all. We will explain what DeFi is all about and which promising projects are already working on it at full speed. As always, it’s worth staying tuned because this will be not only educational but also exciting.

**What is DeFi?**

DeFi is essentially just a conventional financial instrument built on a blockchain. Primarily, the Ethereum blockchain is used for this purpose. DeFi applications are mostly based on open-source protocols for creating and issuing digital assets. Their advantage, among others, is that they are designed to offer notable benefits of operating on a public blockchain, such as censorship resistance and improved access to financial services. In this way, the DeFi movement addresses an important core criterion of cryptocurrencies, and that is the promise of making money and its transaction universally accessible. And that is for every person, no matter where he or she lives in the world.

The DeFi movement takes this promise even a step further. It aims to provide a global, open alternative to every financial service available today. These include the ability

· to save,

· take out loans,

· trade,

· take out insurance

and much more. All that is needed is a smartphone or computer with an internet connection.

This makes it possible to use smart contracts. Those who have already read our knowledge article about Ethereum already know that smart contracts are self-executing contracts. These make it possible to develop far more sophisticated functions than simply automating the sending and receiving of cryptocurrencies. Such decentralized applications are called dApps.

· In the context of DeFi, dApps already exist that can

· The creation of stablecoins,

· the completion of a credit transaction

· executing automated advanced investment strategies.

· What makes DeFi different from the traditional financial system?

The key question, of course, is why use these DeFi-dApps at all? After all, traditional banking or Wall Street counterparts already exist for all of these products mentioned. Unfortunately, this is only true in certain parts of the world. There is also the following difference. At their core, dApps and their associated business processes are not managed by a company, institution, or individual. Instead, the processes are automatic, and the associated rules are hardcoded in the smart contract. There, they are visible to all and transparently represented in the form of code.

Once the smart contract is implemented on the blockchain, it can execute itself with little or no human intervention. DeFi-dApps are thus visible to everyone but pseudonymous. They cannot be directly assigned to the real identity of the user. DeFi-dApps can be used from anywhere in the world where an internet connection is available. They are censorship-resistant and, thanks to the automated execution of the smart contracts and the visible code, conclude contracts and/or their use trustworthy and transparent, even without intermediaries.

Not without reason, DeFi is currently one of the fastest-growing sectors in the crypto field. More than $600 million worth of cryptocurrencies have already been invested in smart contracts in question, and thus in infrastructure. What exactly are some of the most important and popular use cases and projects in the DeFi sector, let’s take a closer look now.

**1. open credit protocols — accessible to everyone**

Open credit protocols have probably attracted more attention recently than any other category in the field of DeFi on Ethereum. Largely due to the meteoric rise in Dai's use and other P2P protocols like Dharma and the creation of liquidity pools like Compound Finance, decentralized lending is garnering powerful attention, and rightfully so. Open, decentralized lending offers numerous advantages over traditional lending structures. It enables

· The integration of lending/borrowing of digital assets,

· the insurance of digital assets,

· instant transaction processing and new methods of secured lending,

· broader access to people who are unable to access traditional services

· standardization and interoperability, which can reduce costs through automation.

Secured lending using open protocols such as MakerDAO and Dharma are designed to minimize the need for trust. They achieve this by making use of the functionality of Ethereum-based smart contracts. Open protocol lending is entirely confined to the public blockchain and has some intriguing long-term implications for expanding financial inclusion worldwide.

 **About Maker (MKR)**

Maker (MKR) is the governance token of the MakerDAO and Maker Protocol:

1. MakerDAO: A decentralized organization to manage DAI, a community-managed, fully decentralized stable coin whose value is pegged to the US dollar.
2. Maker Protocol: A DeFi lending platform based on Ethereum that allows users to take out loans by locking-in collateral in exchange for Dai.

MKR tokens serve as voting shares for the organization managing DAI. MKR gives the holders voting rights over the development of Maker Protocol.

"According to reports, the SEC has hired a blockchain analytics firm to keep an eye on the DeFi business",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/pdgwq0/according_to_reports_the_sec_has_hired_a/,-Aporia,1,2021-08-29 04:07:44,3,/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/pdgwq0/according_to_reports_the_sec_has_hired_a/,NEWS,"According to reports, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has inked a $125,000 agreement with blockchain analytics startup AnChain. Artificial intelligence will be used to monitor and control the decentralized finance industry. MakerDAO, Uniswap, Aave, and Xfinite are just a few of the major platforms.

An [AnChain.AI](https://AnChain.AI) business representative confirmed the deal with the federal regulator to Forbes on Friday, adding the SEC and blockchain startup have the opportunity to sign up to five separate one-year contracts for $125,000 each, for a total of $625,000. According to reports, the first contract began in May.

“The SEC is extremely interested in learning more about what is going on in the area of smart contract-based digital assets,” said Victor Fang, CEO, and co-founder of [AnChain.AI](https://AnChain.AI). “We're giving them technologies to evaluate and track smart contracts,” says the company.

Following SEC chair Gary Gensler's call for decentralized finance, or DeFi, initiatives to register with the agency, saying they are ""decentralized in some respects but extremely centralized in others,"" the government body and the blockchain business have reportedly reached an agreement. According to Gensler, DeFi platform developers and others may create a centralized team that falls under the SEC's regulatory umbrella. The SEC recently stated that it has filed an enforcement action in the first case involving securities employing DeFi technology.

The sector has a market value of more over $126 billion, according to CoinGecko data. Uniswap is the biggest decentralized exchange by volume, with over $1 billion in DeFi tokens moved in the previous 24 hours; its UNI token is also the most valuable, with a market valuation of $14.2 billion.

[AnChain.AI](https://AnChain.AI) is a blockchain analytics company based in California that analyzes crypto transactions across several public and private chains. According to Forbes, the company has created methods to make its business more ""preventive,"" recognizing suspect addresses and transactions rather of waiting until a hack or other problem occurs to investigate."

Why bother owning governance tokens?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pdt6u4/why_bother_owning_governance_tokens/,Wilmotac,1,2021-08-29 18:55:55,43,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pdt6u4/why_bother_owning_governance_tokens/,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,"So I'm primarily thinking of tokens whose only purpose is for governance (Uniswap, MakerDAO), so this doesn't really apply to tokens that distribute some of the protocol fees to governance token holders.

Where do these tokens get their value from? Uniswap is an amazing platform, but you don't need to own Uniswap to use Uniswap. The same goes for most DeFi protocol governance tokens. The vast majority of holders are never going to use their tokens for voting, so what is the purpose of holding these tokens?

Governance token holders, please inform me as to why you buy and hold governance tokens."

&amp;#x200B;

* Arbitrum is an Ethereum scaling solution based on the Optimistic rollup protocol. 
   * It will facilitate low-cost smart contracts with high throughput while leveraging the security and decentralized features of Ethereum.
   * There is no Arbitrum token, the protocol is built on-top of the Ethereum blockchain. 
   * Arbitrum users will essentially be opening 'bar tabs' on the Ethereum network, allowing users to make several transactions and 'roll the up' as one bulk transaction at a later time.

&amp;#x200B;

* Transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain is too damn high for everyday users, especially during times of network congestion where fees can cost more than $20. 
   * It claims to reduce Ethereum gas fees by more than 50x. 
   * Average gas fees for the Ethereum network right now costs $5 - $7. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Arbitrum is onboarding AAVE, Curve, MakerDAO, Sushiswap, Uniswap, and Cream Finance, among other dapps built on Ethereum.
   * The aforementioned dapps are 'blue-chips' with more than $1B in total-value-locked (TVL), in total they share $38B in TVL. 
   * There's currently $110B in Ethereum's defi ecosystem or more than 70% of all of defi. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Bonus: Cryptocurrency's MOON token is built on the Arbitrum network. With a public mainnet launch, we could possibly see easy to access liquidity pools for MOONs. 
* Note: For the first few months, it will be semi-centralized to ensure the safety of the protocol and funds while users get familiarized with the protocol[.](https://imgur.com/a/3gmcBIO)"
