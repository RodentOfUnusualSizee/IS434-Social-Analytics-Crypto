I‚Äôm sure that *glitch* made it‚Äôs hodlers unsure and weary about COMP. I haven‚Äôt read or seen anything about it being fixed. I‚Äôm sure it has. Is this FUD? Someone please explain.

Full proof of my earnings &amp; payouts directly to Coinbase: [https://imgur.com/a/R895hgv](https://imgur.com/a/R895hgv)

Is it worth the time? In my eyes yes.

You will receive most earnings in BTC (over $200). There are over 50 other coins (ETH, ADA, BNB, MATIC and many more) to earn but BTC brings the best ratio.Link: [https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=SLimon)

How does it work:  
DutchyCorp let's you do tasks and surveys where you get awarded Dutchy Coins. With these coins you are able to let a Faucet running and you can get paid in over 50 coins. I only do payouts with the coins featured to be paid out to Coinbase. Therefore I don't pay additional fees.How are you able to get the best possible earnings on DutchyCorp:  
\- Do the Coin Rolls and Dutchy Rolls for daily Bonus  
\- Run the Autofaucet on weekend with 20% claim Bonus  
\- Do Surveys on Offerwall to be able to earn more DUTCHY and increase your own level  
\- be active to get some free Coins by the RainBot  
\- Go to the Shortwall and click on the pages on a daily base  
\- Run the AutoFaucet with Balance Mode for additional 10%

I did my payouts directly to Coinbase. Payouts are really fast and after about ten seconds you get confirmation of your withdrawal. If you are new to Coinbase, you can get an additional $10 of Bitcoin after you have bought Bitcoin worth $100 with this link: [https://www.coinbase.com/join/lussy\_u](https://www.coinbase.com/join/lussy_u)"

I'm new to Defi and fascinated by the idea of combining decentralized governance and finance together. I've been reading Compound whitepaper and docs but I'm still confused by a few questions and hoping I could find answers here so I can confidently make my investment decisions.

1. The interests of borrowing and lending are different, which is source of profit in traditional banking industry. But where does this ""profit"" go in Compound protocol? Does it go to the company (Compound lab) or go to some sort of reserves/ treasury?
2. What other usage does Comp token have aside from governance? Correct me if I'm wrong, Comp token does not share the profit from interest rate spread. Besides, only a very small percentage token holders participate the governance/voting. So there should be a continuous selling pressure. But what maintains it price? 

Any input would be appreciated. Thank you!"

he hospitality industry is evolving as one of the largest industries in the world. It is an excellent example of an industry that grew in response to the growth of customer needs. Your aim as a hotelier is to stay on top of today‚Äôs market by improving service and efficiency.¬† A hotel must adapt its services to the changing needs and lifestyles of its customers to increase their loyalty and retention. In recent years, hospitality and technology have been the primary agitators to help hoteliers innovate their service offerings and deliver added value to their guests.¬†

With the developing value of business events ‚Äì which with latest studies showed that it generated $10.3 trillion in direct spending. The hospitality industry can no longer rely on good meals and clean rooms to attract guests. Hotels and large venues started to compete to stand out by offering a unique experience.¬†

I've been using the card for more than a year already and made way more from the cashback and Spotify rebates than my initial investment!

This is a very big company: recently [they started a huge ad campaign starring Matt Damon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hBC5TVdYT8) and they [bought the naming rights to the Staples Center in L.A. for 20 years](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-11-16/crypto-staples).

The Ruby Steel card tier offers a **$25 instant bonus, free Spotify and 2% cashback on all purchases,** and a nice premium metal card, for ‚Ç¨350 worth of CRO coins that you need to hold for 6 months. After this time you're free to sell them again (or keep if you want to retain the card benefits).

You can easily **recoup the initial cost within a year** and after that you can still use the benefits.

If you want to try it out for free first, you can also opt for the **free** Midnight Blue card which has no fee and **1% cashback** :)

**Important note:** you don't need to put crypto on the card, you can just load it with Euro or USD and spend it!

* The $25 referral bonus will be credited instantly after you've staked for the card and you can sell it for pounds/euros straight away if you want.
* After your card has been delivered, be sure to set it as the payment method for Spotify so that the 100% rebate can be processed automatically.

All cashbacks and bonuses are paid in the CRO cryptocurrency. You can immediately sell the CRO in the app for pounds/euros, which you can use again for purchases with the card if you want."
Earn $30 of crypto by depositing $50 on Cake Defi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/rqcukr/earn_30_of_crypto_by_depositing_50_on_cake_defi/,Klaasiker,1,2021-12-28 18:24:55,0,/r/Compound/comments/rqcukr/earn_30_of_crypto_by_depositing_50_on_cake_defi/,NaN," 

Cake Defi is a decentralized finance platform based in Singapore, utilising the Defichain blockchain which is secured by anchoring with the Bitcoin blockchain. Cake Defi offer a very generous $30 sign-up bonus, paid instantly as DFI (Defichain), for anybody who deposits $50 of crypto. This does not require any additional transactions or trades, just a deposit which you will be able to instantly withdraw if you need to.

Cake Defi is currently best accessed via the website, although mobile applications are being developed and are currently undergoing beta testing.

[Referral-Link to get the $30 Bonus](https://app.cakedefi.com/?ref=571562)

[Non-Ref Link (no Bonus)](https://app.cakedefi.com/)

1. Sign-up to Cake Defi using the referral link to ensure you receive the bonus
2. Verify your identity using photo ID. This used to take up to 72 hours, but is much quicker now
3. Deposit $50 of cryptocurrency. There is a limited number of cryptocurrencies that can be used and if you are planning to withdraw your deposit instantly I would strongly recommend DASH as it has the lowest withdrawal fees. Bitcoin Cash has the next lowest withdrawal fee, followed by Doge and then Litecoin. I suggest checking the withdrawal fee page before signing up to see which suits you best.
4. Once your deposit has been received, your sign-up bonus of $30 will be paid into your account instantly as DFI. This will be staked and locked for 180 days however it does earn interest during that time, currently around **35% APY!** Go to the freezer section and turn off auto-renew if you will want to withdraw after 180 days.
5. The DASH, or whatever you deposited, can be immediately withdrawn to wherever it was deposited from and if necessary, exchanged to GBP and withdrawn to your bank account.
6. After 180 days, withdraw your bonus along with the interest it has accrued.

I have been really impressed with Cake and Defichain as a whole. I invested a bit more than the $50 and due to Liquidity Mining it already gave a nice bonus which I really apprechiate. I am now using the Freezer on Cake Defi to stake more DFI over a much longer timeframe than the initial 6 months as the APY is fantastic, the longer timeframes gives discounts on fees and I can see the value of the coin appreciating over the next few years.

Cake do have other opportunities to earn interest on your crypto using their liquidity pools or via lending. BTC, ETH, BCH, DOGE, LTC and USDT all have good APRs, just keep an eye on the withdrawal fees for BTC, ETH and USDT to ensure you stake enough or for long enough to make it worth your while.

For anybody struggling with buying DASH, it can be purchased at Bitpanda as previously mentioned, but also Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Poloniex and Kucoin. Deposit/withdrawal fees and methods across these exchanges vary.
