The main benefit seems to be voting rights to maintain DAI price, which is interesting, but sounds like work. The downside of owning MKR tokens is that if the DAI-USD peg slips, the financial responsibility falls on MKR holders to cover the difference. Not sure the potential costs outweigh the benefit of being able to vote. Is there some other benefit I'm missing? Is it the association with DAI and ETH that keeps the price up?"

What passive income ways with DeFi do you prefer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/po2cji/what_passive_income_ways_with_defi_do_you_prefer/,Icy-EndCrypt,1,2021-09-14 21:03:17,10,/r/MakerDAO/comments/po2cji/what_passive_income_ways_with_defi_do_you_prefer/,NaN,"Today, modern decentralized protocols and smart contract applications offer the DeFi user things like yield farming, staking, and lending, allowing them to accrue steady growth on their initial outlay. So, what instruments should we consider?

\#1: Lending

Lending is perhaps the most recognized DeFi activity in the space, mainly because many of the early DeFi platforms like [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/) specialized in lending protocols. It‚Äôs a straightforward concept: you lend your digital assets to a platform by locking your assets into a smart contract. This works for me well, and there is no reason to avoid this approach. 

\#2: Staking

As the term implies, staking involves the process of locking in digital assets into a smart contract. Many DeFi platforms also use ‚Äústaking‚Äù as a means to open what is essentially a savings account on the blockchain. Like a savings account, your balance will accrue additional income, typically in the form of the same type of tokens or another token on the same blockchain. In other words, you deposit an asset, and someone uses it, paying you the interest rates based on demand. Examples: [AAVE](https://aave.com/), [Compound](https://compound.finance/), [AlphaHomora](https://homora.alphafinance.io/alpha).

\#3: Yield farming

This one is perhaps my favorite method for DeFi. Yield farming is a newer concept than staking, though the two share many similarities. While staking can refer to actions such as locking up 32 ETH to become a validator node on the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 network, yield farming refers more exclusively to providing liquidity to a DeFi protocol in return for yield. Your liquidity is being used for AMM, paying you the fees when traders exchange one of the tokens you deposited. Examples: [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Curve](https://curve.fi/), [Pancakeswap](https://pancakeswap.finance/).

At the same time, some platforms use a combination of some of these methods, due to which a high interest rate and simplified investment process are achieved. It can be good for early investors. Example: [Midas Yield](https://y.midas.investments/).

If you, like me, are delighted with passive earnings with DeFi, please share your experience and thoughts. What platforms have you already used?"

Maker protocol = the set of smart contracts running on the Ethereum blockchain. 

MakerDAO = the community governing the Maker protocol, the MKR holders, core units, speaking simply it's the social layer of the Maker system.

Maker foundation = the legal structure, now in the process of dissolution. 

Maker = all the things above combined.

Do you agree? If not, why?"

How DAI / MKR works and why the system will fail.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/psannm/how_dai_mkr_works_and_why_the_system_will_fail/,HongKongAntiScam,1,2021-09-21 11:38:13,24,/r/MakerDAO/comments/psannm/how_dai_mkr_works_and_why_the_system_will_fail/,NaN," I looked into how the crypto stable coin DAI works without any physical backing of dollars as well as its corresponding governance token; #MKR. I would like to point out some major issues with the system that is not solved and I don‚Äôt think will be solved.

Ethereum holders can collateralize it and receive the DAI token as a loan. The DAI token is one-to-one pegged to the dollar because the supply and demand of DAI can be controlled by MKR holders through two mechanisms. First, supply and demand for loan taking is driven by a stability fee that will be higher if there is more demand for leverage relative to demand for the stable coin. Supply and demand for the stable coin is driven by interest given on DAI that will be paid for through the stability fee.

Loan takers don‚Äôt receive margin calls, instead their locked collateral is liquidated through an auction where holders of DAI bid DAI for the ownership of the collateralized Ethereum, and DAI gets burned. A liquidation fee is retained in the system.

The MKR governance tokens are not a stable coin and what makes them valuable are their ability to bid for accrued the DAI that gets accrued in the system through stability fees and liquidation fees. The MKR used by the winner of the auction for DAI gets burned and the remaining owners get more concentrated ownership.

Some serious concern remains. If entities have a large enough coalition of MKR holders, they have control over the system and can change rules as they please. Based on my analysis, MKR holders are incentivized to dump their tokens if the MKR price gets overvalued relative to the possible income that can be earned through stability fees and liquidations. This means entities that are important for governance and knows the system are likely to be replaced by atomic MKR speculators overtime that cannot orchestrate meaningful governance voting coalitions.

This means eventually an entity is likely to become large enough to pillage minority MKR holders through hiring themselves as core development units that set their own salaries (in MKR) at an unreasonably high level, which sort of already has happened. Such an entity could also steal all the Ethereum locked in the vaults of loan takers. Additionally, it is easy for such an entity to appear as a multitude of decentralized units, when in fact they act in ordinance.

There is zero transparency for whether the Maker Dao is truly decentralized, therefore I think the system will eventually collapse and other stable coins will dominate it.

Additionally, there are series scaling issues as the availability of the stable coin is limited by demand for leveraged Ethereum or other assets that may be allowed to be used as collateral in the vault.

Given the risks I have already pointed out, the valuation of the MKR token seem too high with a current P/E of approx. 80, and even if the DAI supply 10x, the income will not be enough to offset the costs of the core units paid in MKR to make this a worthwhile investment."
