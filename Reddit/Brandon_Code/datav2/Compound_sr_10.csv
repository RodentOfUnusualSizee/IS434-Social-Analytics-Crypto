Unfortunately, the web interface for Compound has disabled withdrawing my earned Comp... So naturally, I went to do it myself.

I spent on average maximum 5min per day on this page and was watching Netflix with it.

Here is my full proof of all my earnings and payouts: [https://imgur.com/a/WvRhNBV](https://imgur.com/a/WvRhNBV)  
Most earnings are in BTC (over $200). There are plenty of other coins to earn too but BTC brings the best ratio.

DutchyCorp let's you do tasks and surveys where you get awarded Dutchy Coins. With these coins you are able to let a Faucet running and you can get paid in about 50 coins. Payouts to your Coinbase Account are without fees.  
How are you able to earn so much on DutchyCorp:  
\- Do the Coin Rolls and Dutchy Rolls for daily Bonus  
\- Run the Autofaucet on weekend with 20% claim Bonus  
\- Do Surveys on Offerwall to be able to earn more DUTCHY and increase your own level  
\- be active to get some free Coins by the RainBot  
\- Go to the Shortwall and click on the pages on a daily base  
\- Run the AutoFaucet with Balance Mode for additional 10%

I did my payouts directly to Coinbase. Payouts are really fast and after about ten seconds you get confirmation of your withdrawal.

For example, one user withdrew [65k COMP](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb6d5122afe04a9905adc5de7f708cabc5821e65fb7d6f0bfd571d35b1ddab7f2) and another one [30k COMP](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbc246c878326f2c128462d08a0b74048b1dbee733adde8863f569c949c06422a)

Now the smart contract is empty and I and other honest users cannot withdraw the accrued COMP tokens I had there because the contract is empty. 

Meanwhile, the developers are saying ""Users don't have to worry about their funds; the only risk is that you (or another user) receives an unfairly large quantity of COMP."" and ""Please return it to the Compound Timelock.  Keep 10% as a white-hat.  Otherwise, it's being reported as income to the IRS, and most of you are doxxed.""

It looks like this new finance paradigm is run by morons and scammers.  Just buy shithereum with real money so you could pay $100 for a single contract interaction, and then they ""update"" the contract and some other developers empty the smart contract and you get nothing in return while miners and developers and scammers get rich."

I'm trying to perform some analytics on Compound and determine how many loans are paid off successfully and how many are liquidated.  


My idea was to do some digging in Etherscan, but I'm not sure what contract activity to look for.
