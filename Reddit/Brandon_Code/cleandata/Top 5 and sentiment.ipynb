       "  '&gt;For one thing, as far as I know, there is still no user-friendly way to do this.\\n\\nWe actually have an interface available where you can take flash loans from Aave or dYdX and utilize them for whatever you see fit in combination with other defi protocols.\\n\\nWe called this the \"Recipe Creator\" and you can try it out at: [https://app.defisaver.com/recipes](https://app.defisaver.com/recipes). The introduction post is here: [https://medium.com/defi-saver/introducing-the-defi-saver-recipe-creator-34d4c26630c](https://medium.com/defi-saver/introducing-the-defi-saver-recipe-creator-34d4c26630c)\\n\\nWhat\\'s this useful for and what you can you use a flash loan for?\\n\\nWell, we use flash loans in a bunch of leveraging and refinancing actions for defi lending positions. Here\\'s one example how you can, for example, move a position from one protocol to another using flash loans.\\n\\nLet\\'s assume you have a MakerDAO ETH Vault and you wan\\'t to move that whole position (a position with ETH deposited and DAI borrowed) to Compound. This is how you can do that:\\n\\n* You flash borrow DAI (e.g. 50,000 DAI, if that\\'s your current debt)\\n* You pay back debt in MakerDAO\\n* You withdraw ETH from MakerDAO\\n* You deposit ETH into Compound\\n* You borrow (50,000) DAI from Compound\\n* You pay back the falsh loan with this Dai\\n\\nVoila! You have successfully refinanced your loan and moved it to a completely different protocol with a completely different set of conditions - something you\\'d never be able to do in traditional finance, or at least certainly not in one, single transaction taking you potentially under a minute :)',\n",
       "  \"I would hate to come across as an illegible defi-elitist or anything like that.\\n\\nHere's an attempt at an ELI5 of this process:\\n\\nA flash loan is a new concept introduced by defi that allows anyone to borrow potentially unlimited (or at least tremendously huge) amounts of funds for whatever operation, as long as all of those funds are also returned by the end of that same transaction.\\n\\nOne use case for flash loans is moving an existing long-term borrowing made in DeFi from one protocol to another. For example, if you have deposited ETH into MakerDAO and borrowed DAI, you can utilize a flash loan to move that loan from the Maker protocol to the Compound protocol, for example.\\n\\nThis is done by utilising a flash loan to clear debt in the first protocol, moving funds from the first to the second protocol, and then borrowing the same amount of funds from the second protocol to pay off the flash loan.\\n\\nWhy would you want to do this? Well, maybe the second protocol is offering lower borrowing rates on the asset you have borrowed. Or maybe the second protocol started offering liquidity incentives - token rewards given just for using the protocol and having your funds in it. There could be a number of reasons.\\n\\nStill not an ELI5, but hopefully works as an ELI15. Let me know if I can clarify a specific step more!\",\n",
       "  'Well, what I mentioned earlier is an interface that allows users to create custom combinations of actions, including flash loans and what not. A UI where users are expected to put together the puzzle for their transaction, so to say, is defintiely not a mainstream thing. That\\'s meant for highly advanced users who have unique combinations of actions in mind.\\n\\nBut for the mainstream, we\\'re always working on 1-click/1-transaction options for all sorts of things.\\n\\nFor example, what I described earlier is also available in our Loan Shifter interface at DeFi Saver, where one can just select an existing MakerDAO position on the left and the target protocol on the right and just click \"shift\" - the frontend handles everything for them and that single quick transaction gets their position across to a completely different protocol\\n\\nThere are other teams working on similar things, too, of course. And the UX available to DeFi users is getting better by the day, really. If we compare any defi app from 2018 or 2019 to somethig that\\'s been updated regularly or launched recently... The improvements are very noticeable.',\n",
       "  'Ah, ok, I see what you mean.\\n\\nIn terms of fees, two types of fees should be considered:\\n\\n* Transaction fees - these don\\'t have anything to do with the falsh loan specifically, but they are mandatory and cannot be avoided. A transaction fee is usually paid no matter whether the transaction fails or not. And as OP mentioned, these kinds of transactions are complex, which means that they are gas intensive, which again means that they can become very costly. If we\\'re talking about Ethereum, this can easily be in multiple hundred dollars worth of ETH (so 0.1 - 0.5 ETH or maybe even more, really depends on the number of actions in the transaction).\\n* Protocol fees for the flash loans - these will depend on the protocol from which the flash loan is being taken. Some of the options include:\\n   * Aave - which currently has a 0.09% fee on any flash loans (and they have the highest variety of assets available for flash loaning)\\n   * MakerDAO - which currently has a 0.05% fee on flash minting Dai (but DAI is the only available asset)\\n   * dYdX - which had flash loan fees at no fees whatsoever (with ETH, DAI and USDC available for flash loaning)\\n   * WETH10 - not a protocol per se, but the latest WETH (wrapped Ether) token contract allows for flash minting any amount of ETH at no fees whatsoever\\n\\nIn order for your transaction to complete successfully, you need to return the full amount required by the protocol from which you took the flash loan or where you performed the flash mint, and that amount will depend on whether the source used has any required fees.\\n\\nArbitrage is one of the most obvious use cases, but certainly not the only one as OP originally suggested. To complete a successful arbitrage in defi you have to find a noticeable price disparity in some assets on multiple dexes and hope that you make your play quickly enough. This is a field that\\'s largely dominated by bots nowadats, as OP mentioned, and it\\'s usually a game not worth playing, as you could quickly end up losing funds on failed transactions.\\n\\nIn terms of other use cases, I mentioned loan refinancing, but then another use case is for what some call \"self liquidation\".\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s say you have a collateralized debt position with 10 ETH deposited into Compound and 5,000 USDC borrowed. What you can do is self liquidate that position using a flash loan: you make a flash loan of 5,000 USDC, you use that to clear your debt in Compound, you take out your 10 ETH, swap \\\\~1.5 ETH for 5000+ USDC and then use this USDC to pay back the flash loan. This way you can clear your debt without having the borrowed funds and you walk away with the remaining \\\\~8.5 ETH. This is especially useful when leveraging (longing/shorting) assets using lending protocols (as described [here](https://medium.com/defi-saver/how-to-long-or-short-any-asset-using-defi-lending-protocols-812300c9a640), for example).\\n\\nI know it may sound complicated when explained like that, but the cool thing is that some apps have this available for users at a click of a button. For example we call this feature \"Repay\" in DeFi Saver and it\\'s available in the dashboards of all defi lending protocols we have supported (Maker, Compound, Aave, Reflexer and Liquity).',\n",

If you make a loan against your ETH and ETH grows 10x in a matter of a year or two - you can either pay back the debt and get your full ETH amount back or \"self liquidate\" and clear that debt with a fraction of your initially deposited ETH.',\n",
       "  'Hey, Mammoths. We wanted to, but it\\'s unfortunately a lot more complex and it would be very hard to pull of in one transaction because of how much gas would be needed.\\n\\nTo put things in perspective, this is the process for MakerDAO: transfer CDP to DSA, claim INST, transfer CDP to dsproxy (+ optionally swap INST to whichever chosen token).\\n\\nBut for a Compound or Aave position it would involve multiple flash loans and likely multiple token transfers to-and fro. The CDP transfer uses as much gas as one token transfer, basically, so really a lot simpler process.\\n\\nHowever, once we have the migration for Compound/Aave available from Instadapp DSA to dsproxy/smart wallet you\\'ll be able to do this in two transactions. They have a migration available on their end already (from dsproxy to DSA) which allows you to claim INST, and then you\\'ll have the option to return soon.🤞\\n\\n***Edit:*** Keep in mind I\\'m talking about Compound/Aave positions that are on the dsproxy (or what we label as \"Smart Wallet\" in the DeFi Saver UI). \\n\\nIf you\\'re using Compound or Aave directly with your EOA, in this case the migration back will not be possible any time soon (maybe when/if EIP3074 passes).

Effectively, it\\'s being used as a smart contract wallet, with your EOA being the only owner and manager.\\n\\nThe DSProxy was first popularised [by MakerDAO](https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/devtools/working-with-dsproxy/working-with-dsproxy.md) and later adopted by other major protocols such as Balancer and Reflexer, but also by us at DeFi Saver, where we use it to keep positions in any number of integrated protocols. Note that your one DSProxy holds all of those positions.\\n\\nBut the cool thing about the DSProxy is that it also enables additional authorisations to be made on it, which is how DFS Automation is made possible. The smart contracts [audit](https://medium.com/defi-saver/defi-saver-automation-security-audit-summary-a883d4fde1b) briefly explains it.\\n\\nFinally, to answer your question about transactions showing up on Etherscan - you\\'ll need to switch to the \"Internal Txns\" tab and also turn on \"Advanced view\" so all transactions executed through your DSProxy show up.

Meanwhile, ethereum will have launched rollups and scaled on an evm-compatible layer 2.\\n\\nThat's what I will be saying in August.\",\n",

How would a smart contract system, like for example MakerDAO or Compound, be able to work with its smart contract logic split between Ethereum and Cardano's KEVM sidechain?\\n\\n&gt; The smart contracts on Etherium will continue to exist but won’t manage the new tokens, so liquidity can move over and then behave in the same manner as before.\\n\\nSorry if I am reading your comment wrong, but are you talking about a token that is centrally managed/minted/burned by two separate canonical contracts, one on Ethereum and one on Cardano's KEVM sidechain? Otherwise there will always be one contract that mints, backs, and burns tokens, and that contract will have to live in one place - Ethereum, Cardano KEVM or Cardano proper - and only its tokens will be portable across chains  due to the bridge, but not its token logic.\\n\\nThank you for answering these questions, I feel like there is not a lot of documentation for how the ERC-20 converter works, so I like to ask people who are knowledgeable about it.\",\n",
       "  'That\\'s a great question. Here is what would need to change about Cardano for me to become comfortable with it as an investment, in no particular order:\\n\\n* Me getting straight, understandable answers to questions I\\'ve been asking about the limitations of Cardano\\'s EUTxO model, which I asked about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoDevelopers/comments/myeodg/how_does_writing_a_dex_in_plutus_work/) in April, and which SandaeSwap [wrote about in their whitepaper](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nqdun4/daily_general_discussion_june_2_2021/h0a4g8t/).\\n\\n* Me getting straight, understandable answers to questions I\\'ve been asking about Cardano\\'s fee model under full L1 load, [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoDevelopers/comments/myeodg/how_does_writing_a_dex_in_plutus_work/gvvnjjx/) and in countless other threads I\\'ve commented in.\\n\\n* Me getting straight, understandable answers to why native tokens are functionally superior to Ethereum\\'s ERC-20 tokens. Everything I have read about it is either hand-wavey, or talks about how it\\'s hard and error-prone for developers to copy-paste the ERC-20 templates (bs), or talks about how Cardano\\'s token transfers don\\'t cost any more than its native transfers (which doesn\\'t matter if ALL types of transfers are very cheap.)\\n\\n* Seeing Cardano adopt a scaling solution with better data availability guarantees than Hydra, which requires all interested parties to be online and active in order to arbitrate, similar to Lightening Network\\'s \"watch towers\". Zk and optimistic rollups are one idea (like Ethereum), on-chain execution sharding is another (like Polkadot), data sharding with some extra transaction ordering guarantees are another (like Solana), a native zero-knowledge L1 is another (like Mina). Cardano is pursuing none of those avenues publicly, instead sticking with their outdated 2015 state channel tech.\\n\\n* Significant amounts of liquidity migrating to Cardano. Whales who are liquidity farming on Ethereum just don\\'t have an incentive to fragment their liquidity by moving to Cardano. It\\'s a chicken and egg. I\\'ll keep my eyes open for some clever tokenomics solution, but I don\\'t have my fingers crossed.\\n\\n* Significant amounts of *grassroots* projects migrating to Cardano. It doesn\\'t matter how *many* projects, the only thing that matters is the big players. When Uniswap, MakerDAO, or Compound - or other companies that similarly command billions of dollars of volume and TVL - migrate to Cardano, I\\'ll start taking a second look.\\n\\n* IOHK starting to be more forthcoming about the limitations of their technology. As I mentioned before, the always-online requirement of Hydra. The concentration of stake into multiple pools owned by the same owner (e.g. dozens of binance pools). The compromises an AMM DEX has to make to run under the EUTxO model. Being straightforward that the \"ERC-20 Converter\" does NOT do any \"conversion\" whatsoever, it\\'s a BRIDGE, and rename it \"ERC-20 Bridge\" so that it\\'s clear it is the same thing that a bunch of other chains have.\\n\\n* Smart money starting to take Cardano seriously. ADA had its big day in the sun when it entered the top 10 in 2017, but it\\'s still nowhere on the radar of institutions, silicon valley, or VC-backed startups compared to Ethereum. Cardano is designed for and marketed to retail investors, not institutions or developers, and the lack of real institutional interest compared to Ethereum shows this very clearly.\\n\\n* A Web3/Metamask-like way to interact with smart contracts through web interfaces via a browser extension and mobile app. This is critical for users to be able to use smart contracts, otherwise Cardano is going to go through some miserable days like Ethereum went through in 2016-2017, when you had to manually invoke functions on smart contracts through MyEtherWallet to get anything done. Huge pain in the ass.\\n\\n* Being more honest about comparing either Cardano\\'s *present* to Ethereum\\'s *present*, or Cardano\\'s *future* to Ethereum\\'s *future*. A lot of the time, Cardano\\'s future gets compared to Ethereum\\'s present, and that\\'s really unfair to Ethereum. Cardano\\'s future 1M tx/sec gets compared to Ethereum\\'s current 15 tx/sec instead of its future 100k tx/sec with sharding and rollups. Cardano\\'s future multi-language smart contract support gets compared to Ethereum\\'s current Solidity-only support (which isn\\'t even true, since Ethereum supports Vyper too.) Cardano\\'s future gain in market share is compared to Ethereum\\'s current market share, not the bigger and bigger market share it\\'s likely to pick up over the next few years, etc.\\n\\n* Being more honest about how Ethereum\\'s lack of on-chain governance is a deliberate choice based on Vitalik\\'s viewpoints, and how Cardano\\'s on-chain governance is a divergence from those viewpoints to create a blockchain that has a different philosophy. Right now it\\'s touted as a \"straight upgrade\" rather than a difference in philosophy. It also doesn\\'t exist yet, tying into the previous point.\\n\\n* In general, having better technical resources. I still haven\\'t seen an easy, straightforward tutorial for how to set up a Plutus dev environment and publish a \"Hello World\" contract to the Alonzo testnet. Compare that to Ethereum where there\\'s about a million tutorials on how to test and publish a smart contract on Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Nintendo Wii and your microwave oven.\\n\\n* Either Cardano\\'s technology catching up to justify its ridiculously large market cap, or the market cap lowering to meet the current state of its tech. There are other chains like Solana that have working products with a lot more technically impressive innovations than Cardano but are worth 1/10th of what ADA is right now. ADA is by far the most frothy crypto in the top 5. Even though it\\'s not launched yet, all of its potential future growth is already priced in for some reason. There really isn\\'t a lot more room for Cardano to run, because its run has already been *massive*.\\n\\nThese are a few of the things that would need to change in order for me to admit I am wrong about Cardano being a good investment looking towards the future. Right now, way too many of my questions are going unanswered about it. Unanswered on IOHK\\'s website, unanswered in the Cardano Devs subreddit, and unanswered by any blog article or other resource I\\'ve been able to find on Google.\\n\\nBecause so many of my questions have gone unanswered for so long, at some point I am forced to assume that good answers simply don\\'t exist. Otherwise someone, somewhere, would have written *something* that would have been picked up by Google, or someone around here would know something about and be able to point me in the right direction to get them answered.',\n",

From solely a UX perspective, whether a network is Layer 1 or Layer 2 is next to meaningless. Every time you say that users have to move their assets over to a separate network, well, if they chose Solana instead of Arbitrum, they would still have to bridge their assets from wherever they currently are (maybe the Ethereum Layer 1, or BSC).\\n\\nTake for example a user who owns ETH and wants to bridge their ETH to Arbitrum or Solana. I believe Solana is planning to gain a lot of their user base from Ethereum L1 users who get fed up with the fees and want to switch, so this seems like a reasonable example.\\n\\nIf the user's ETH is in their own wallet, then:\\n\\n* To move it to Arbitrum, they use an Arbitrum bridge, then switch the metamask extension they already have installed to Arbitrum via the dropdown.\\n\\n* To move it to Solana, they have to install a new extension, generate a new wallet, and use the Solana bridge (wormhole).\\n\\nIf the user's ETH is on an exchange, then:\\n\\n* If the exchange supports tokenized ETH on the Arbitrum network, they can withdraw the ETH directly to Arbitrum. Otherwise they withdraw to the Ethereum L1 and bridge to Arbitrum.\\n\\n* If the exchange supports tokenized ETH on the Solana network, they can withdraw the ETH directly to Solana. Otherwise they withdraw to the Ethereum L1 and bridge to Solana.\\n\\nIn all cases, moving ETH to Arbitrum takes the same amount of effort and cost, or less, as moving it to Solana.\\n\\nIf the user switches to Arbitrum, they can continue to use Metamask, the same tool they have always used and are familiar with. Then while on Arbitrum, they can use Uniswap, SushiSwap, Aave, Curve, Etherscan, Loopring, and MakerDAO as they're used to using on the Ethereum L1, but with low fees. These are the Arbitrum launch partners when the mainnet goes public in the next two weeks.\\n\\nJust as moving assets to Binance Smart Chain has been the obvious lowest friction play for Ethereum users who want lower fees but don't care about decentralized custody, Arbitrum will be the obvious lowest friction play for users who want lower fees but do care about decentralized custody.\",\n",
       "  '&gt; Assuming that’s right, can’t maker owners just never increase the USDC cap and only allow ETH / other assets to raise their limits? Thus chipping away at USDC dominance? \\n\\nIt\\'s a deeper systems design thing. Imagine that DAI is going above peg, say it\\'s at $1.02.\\n\\nNormally, governance reduces the interest rate (stability fee) so that more people will be incentivized to lock up ETH and take out loans, flooding the market with more DAI and bringing the price down to peg.\\n\\nBut the problem is that even with completely free borrowing, a zero percent interest rate, there still weren\\'t enough people willing to lock up ETH (or other trustless coins) and take out the free loans. Thus no way to print more properly collateralized DAI to keep the peg down.\\n\\nSo more recently, MakerDAO invented the \"peg stability module\" which lets people directly trade USDC into the Maker contract for DAI, to arb the peg down so the peg doesn\\'t get out of control, but obviously the downside to that is that whenever DAI price spikes, Maker keeps taking more and more USDC on its balance sheet from the arbers.\\n\\nThe problem is that there\\'s no way for the money supply (DAI) to contract, only to expand. As more and more DAI gets lost and forgotten, there\\'s no way to confirm it\\'s out of circulation and take it off Maker\\'s debt sheet, so the DAI tokens remain \"live\" and need to be collateralized, even if they\\'re in an address with a completely forgotten private key. With Reflexer, they can slowly devalue RAI, emulating a negative interest rate and sucking debt out of the system (and out of dead RAI holders\\' wallets) over a longer time frame, where this value is accumulated to Vault holders in the form of depreciation of the borrowed asset (so, you get paid to borrow). But with a hard target of $1, Maker isn\\'t able to do that with DAI.',\n",
