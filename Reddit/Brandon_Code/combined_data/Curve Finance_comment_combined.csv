Elisa_LaViudaNegra,"I really enjoy I Will Teach You To Be Rich by Ramit Sethi. Great book that teaches young folks the basics of personal finance not according to The Rules (whatever those are), but according to what YOU value in life so that once your bases are covered, you can spend guilt-free on the things you truly love.

I also use You Need A Budget for budgeting. It truly changed my financial life. I know it’s a yearly cost but I pay it gladly because the value of knowing exactly what my money is doing is priceless to me, after having crawled out of a ton of debt. There’s a bit of a learning curve, but there are a ton of resources out there to learn, both supplied by YNAB and by Youtubers like Nick True. You can also google to find a free 3-month trial so you can get the hang of it before paying.",2021-01-01 01:37:04
maurymarkowitz,"&gt;The problem of fission is not deployment time. Look at China.

Ok, lets.

China currently has 49 reactors on the grid with a total capacity around 47 GWe. Their first such example, a small-scale system, was connected to the grid in 1991, so this buildout took place over a period of about 30 years.

In contrast, the USA has 94 reactors with a total of 97 GWe. The vast majority of those were connected to the grid between 1968 and the early 1980s. The US built twice as much capacity in about half the time of China.

France, a country of 67 million, has a fleet of 56 reactors for 61 GWe mostly built in the 20 years between the late 1970s and early 1990s.

So, China is well behind the install curve compared to other large buildouts.

China currently has another 15 reactors under construction for a total of 15 GWe, which will come online over the next 10 years.

In contrast, China installed 44 GWe of PV in 2018 alone, and another 30 last year. The last four years have installed more renewables capacity than their current 50-year nuclear plan.

PV and wind are trivially easy to finance and install. That is why they are being installed and nuclear is not. As you say:

&gt;No one want to invest their money in a plant that could be stalled for years because of licensing issues.

Although, it should be noted, licensing has little to do with it. As the recent MIT report demonstrates, most of the problem is in construction and planning. Perhaps things will change when the condo boom slows down and you can actually hire trades again.",2021-01-01 03:30:50
ScutumWall,"&gt;考虑投资回报效率 

经济学里efficiency所考虑的东西比return广多了，只考虑return的是finance。 

&gt; 这里讲的是技术封锁的行业...谈市场竞争没有意义...就是说只需要考虑走那一条路快慢走到的分别， 做出来之后自然会保证整个国内的市场

You do realize所谓的“做得出来”本身就是一个效率问题？这个信息时代要“做”什么东西的门槛比一两百年前低多了，MIT满实验室都是液体金属电池，清北中科院实验室里也不缺光刻机，非要强行说ends justify the means，只要你能接受成品率低，稳定性不足等低效率问题把laboratory bench变成production bench，要“占领”哪个行业完全就是资本问题，说到底100Gwh的液体金属电池和100Gwh锂电池都是100Gwh。

&gt; 换句话说 efficiency这个词在geopolitic前面根本不重要

当然重要。所谓的infant industry+embargo问题归根结底也就是你的AC太高supply线太左在国际市场毫无竞争力从而导致自己国内市场的supply side能轻易被国际monopoly控制而造成市场混乱。任何东西都有自己对应的utility curve，geopolitics、行为经济学里的各种bias、efficiency等是影响其坡度的exogenous variables，而效率在很多情况是主导因素。这世界上如果任何一个政权/群体/国家能做到无视efficiency，人类早就家家一台CCS设备，对人类未来影响最大的climate change也就小事一桩。",2021-01-01 08:33:14
yungmemlord,"MMT is a failure. In fact, MMT is simply a repurposed package of ideas, mainly taken from the doctrine of Functional Finance (“MMT seems to be pretty much the same thing as Abba Lerner's ""functional finance"" doctrine from 1943” - Paul Krugman) which failed in the 1970s. It argues that “slack,” the amount of resources not being used at a given time, is what determines inflation. This is partly based on an economic model called the Phillips Curve, which argued there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment (more of one will lead to less of the other). However, simultaneously high inflation and unemployment in the 1970s showed that this model was flawed. Rather, it is monetary policy, not slack, that determines the path of inflation. As economist Milton Friedman once said, “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon”. Not fiscal, monetary.

MMT also argues that fiscal policy is more important than monetary policy in determining inflation, so raising taxes is the solution to high inflation. However, this is not the experience of the United States. In the late 1960s, President Lyndon Johnson followed this logic by raising taxes and balancing the budget, but high inflation persisted. In fact, inflation only fell in the early 1980s when Fed Chair Paul Volcker reduced the growth of the money supply, despite high budget deficits under President Reagan during the same period. 

Lastly MMT contains too few safeguards against the risks of excessive public debt. Debt that might look manageable in one economic environment may become unsustainable in another, as Greece learned during the Great Recession. While the United States is unlikely to default on its debt, high debt can cause other problems, including either higher taxation or higher inflation in the future. Either of these problems can stifle future growth and prosperity. Furthermore, while the US is not in danger of becoming like Greece in the near future, history tells us that circumstances change. If the US continues to accumulate massive amounts of debt, there is no guarantee we will always be able to easily pay it off.",2021-01-01 09:58:27
tiltedsquares,"Yeah of course, so I'm ultimately an implementations consultant for a software company in the bay area, however, I specialize on the finance products. Hence a Financials Tech Consultant. 

It's a rly fun job since I technically work for a tech firm NOT a consulting firm- so I get the perks for a tech firm without necessarily all the stress and corporateness of a consulting firm. The learning curve can be steep bc youre learning the software, the industry, as well as your corporate customers processes. For example... escheatments. You'll learn how the software handles escheated checks, how the industry typically handles them, and then see how your customer handles them. Based on that, you'll need to combine all three together in the final product that you'd advise your customer on. Its not very tech heavy, as in you can learn all the tech on the job, as much as it is just learning finance as an industry. 

In the last couple years, I've been exposed to so much including the industries of my customers, my own tech software, and the inner workings of these corporations. I've enjoyed it and it's challenges. Hope this helps! Feel free to dm if you want to learn more!",2021-01-02 12:39:05
tveiga91,"Well, i understand that, trust me. But i think that even newbies have to learn the hard way sometimes when the easy way doesn't work.

When I entered this ""world"" of crypto back at the begin of last year (2020) i did know nothing about ETH or XRP, hell I didn't even knew there was 6000 coins! Of course I new it was extremely volatile so I did my research, i studied bitcoin, began to use ethereum, learning what was ERC-20, then NFT, then eventually I started to discover new projects, like CDC, Theta, Cardano, Tezos, Doge, XRP also (i did buy some, but i never saw what real pb they did solve, so i basically dumped my 20$ bag at the time and never looked back).

I think that crypto has a learning curve that everybody will take, even if they don't want to. Some will take the safe way, other the dangerous way. Even if the two are dangerous as f... I think that if people want to go blind and buy XRP, then let them. Maybe it's a necessary evil so they can open their eyes. Crypto is not for the average joe, but it's not unaccessible also, if people are willing to do the bare minimum, wich most don't. That's why we see so much whining about scams, ""hacked"" wallets (wich never are, it's just plain ignorance, but then again necessary as a lesson) and so on. I did fell for the famous elon giveaway, took my lessons and continued to stack bitcoin without whining, because I knew I was the sole responsible.

My opinion is to just let them be, they will learn the lesson and there will be two outcomes from that. Either they change their posture about this game, and start to play it by the rules and become millionaires, or they go crawling back to their mommy's crying that it's the crypto fault for ""robbing"" their money. Either way, I'm fine with that.

All projects I hold, i did my own research. From the beginning, without even having experience from the stock market. A complete noob. I studied about finance last year. I read books, studied white papers, took some classes online about TA and FA. I followed trusted reviewers at youtube. And i consolidated my portfolio to 5 projects for now and that's enough for the time being. My point is that there's is two type of noobs, the likes like me and the other ones who want to go the hardway. I'm no better than anyone, nor I think myself to be that way, but i really think that each one of us has their learning pattern and we should not mess with that. Even if we have good intentions. 😊",2021-01-02 22:19:29

luketran95,"There's no advantage of having more credits than your peers. If you have done more courseworks than your freshmen fellows, and on par with sophomore, then what? You get ahead of the curve by having more time to prepare (in terms of networking, technicals, and behaviorial), not by having less time. 

If your undergrad program last 4 years, then stick to its schedule. If you think workload is kinda vanila and you want to take on more courses to expedite your degree completion, here's the advice: Don't. Use the time to expand your network, prep for technicals, join case competitions, do mock interviews.

By the look of your resume, you already have basic knowledge of modelling, that's a good start. You know the game early on, good, don't waste your potential. Now shift your focus on hunting relevant internships for the summer. 

Here's my suggestion if you're following IBD, other high-finance professions might deviate from this.

**Stick to 4 year schedule**

\- Freshmen Summer: Boutique IB, Search fund, Small PE shop, etc.. And countinue to network relentlessly.

\- Sophomore Summer: Try punching for BB/EB/MM IB. If it works, great for you. Going through a summer at a big bank will give you a sense what IB is really like, and if it's not for you, you can use the experience to leverage your profile to get something else next summer. 

\- Junior Summer: If you still like IB and didn't land a BB/EB/MM IB gig in sophomore, give it another shot. If you landed a good gig, you could aim for a better firm. (i.e.: You interned in UBS last year, and this year you interview for Evercore/Goldman). 

\- Senior year: If it didn't work out for you in sophomore &amp; junior summers, you can still try full-time recruiting this year.",2021-01-02 23:32:44
dnautatrades,"Taken straight from my comment in my discord....

@everyone I've done A LOT of reading and watching to learn what I know now regarding the stock market or trading options. Some of it was due to experience, but for the most part I learned a lot because I made the effort to learn. I wanted to get better at making money. I wanted to know what to do and what not to do in different scenarios. I didn't want to rely on guessing or following complete strangers blindly. I wanted to be better than the average ""Robinhood trader"".

Some people don't want to learn and just want to make money. I completely understand if that sounds like you. Trading is hard work and it's more a lifestyle rather than a hobby. Keeping up with news, watching stocks, paying attention to your positions, gauging how the market is moving, etc etc. It's crazy! Not to mention it's a never ending learning curve/journey! Just when you think you've learned something or perfected a strategy, someone else comes along with more knowledge and experience than you, that can do it much better and easier.

Some people don't have time for all that. However, for those of you in here that want to learn or improve so you don't need anyone else, I've included some youtube channels, websites, and sources that have helped me learn.

ConceptualisticJury,"Unfortunately, I think it’s due to the economic barriers of investing in precious metals and a lack of financial knowledge in these communities. 

Precious metals is a good hedge against inflation, but I would recommend an investor put money in stocks or bonds, 401k’s, and IRAs before investing in precious metals. Many low income minority communities in the US either don’t have the money or the financial literacy to know or utilize the benefits of these programs. 

I think more finance and budgeting classes in middle school and high school would be a good start. My Hispanic friends who are first-generation college graduates are all learning about inflation and investing on their own and it’s a steep learning curve.",2021-01-03 03:27:48

pickmetoo,"Technical vs. Artsy depends entirely on your job and career path but in general, it will be more technical. Even as a 'design' architect who works primarily on schematic design phase international projects, the technical side of it is always at the back of my mind. In architecture, unlike art, nothing you draw is worth anything if it can't be built. I haven't touched an enclosure detail in 2 years but you better believe that the technical feasibility is in mind when I draw anything. 

On the complete opposite side of the industry, there are architects who do nothing but figure out how to put buildings together and draw details for 40 years. Keep in mind, *Architect* is a singular job title that encompasses a wide range of career paths. Some licensed architects have never worked on actual build work and regularly pull all-nighters for pennies on the hour while others have done nothing but site-adaptations for Chick-fil-a or raised-wall warehouses and get rich doing it. 

And one thing to note - when architects refer to something as ""technical"", it's not necessarily in the sense of math and science. Technical in this context generally refers to construction drawings. If you've never looked at a set of commercial construction documents I would recommend doing so otherwise you might not have a clue what I'm talking about. But in general, design phase work is more creative but a fraction of the work done at the average architecture office. The majority of work being done is detail drawings which are enlarged drawings showing how parts of the building actually go together. Think waterproofing, thermal insulation, wall structure etc. 

Regardless of how your career path progresses and what you're interested in, the first few years out of school will be fairly tedious full of long days annotating plans, picking up markups on detail drawings, working on roof plans etc. All boring shit. Beyond that, it's like any other career - it is what you make of it. If anyone tells you architecture is a horrible career, take it with a grain of salt. Likewise, if anyone tells you it's the best job of the world understand that they're one of the rare people who actually love what they do for a living. Do I love it? No, I love good wine, a charcuterie board and great company. Do I enjoy it? Sometimes - enough so that I don't dread most Monday's and don't mind working late every once in a while. Can I tolerate it in order to live a comfortable life and occasionally get the opportunity to do some really cool shit? Absolutely. I can't tell you that you should 100% be an architect but I can tell you that it's not near as dark and miserable as a lot of the people on the internet may lead you to believe.

At the end of the day, architecture is a job. Just like law, medicine, engineering, retail, corporate finance, etc. Literally, they pay you and to show up to work 40-some-odd weeks of the year and you do your work and go on with your life. Don't fall into any illusions that it has to be some sacrificial lifestyle and you're already ahead of the curve. The most miserable people I've ever met in my life are architects who fell into the illusion that *architecture isn't a career - it's a lifestyle*. Guess what happens when you put all of your happiness into what you do for a living - it's not good. I don't care if you're the top neurosurgeon, architect or hedge-fund manager in the world. You will more than likely be miserable if you don't have a fulfilling life outside of the office.",2021-01-03 14:55:10
BaronGoh,"My girlfriend studied economics and also mathematics so this is not exactly my experience. However, from what I understand, the econ major isn't very rigorous and you'd likely be better off in the finance major or at least QAMO. The standards for grading sounded like they were closer to the humanities compared to STEM (grading sometimes determined more on perception of effort / willing to give curve or bump grades) and I heard her have issues w/ nearly every group project (i.e. people wouldn't put in effort until the last day before project consistently among other things). Also, the department in general as the other commenter mentioned seemed more theoretical. Most of the applied research relating to the financial markets and such were in the business school whereas econ was in the social science department. However, there seemed to be some interesting topics like behavioral economics and international trade policies happening if those things are more interesting to you.",2021-01-03 16:17:31
BagofBabbish,"Usually de-risking means reducing volatility. In finance there is a principle that states there is a curve illustrating the maximum possible expected return for any given level of risk.

You can measure risk by volatility, ie how bumpy is the ride up. If cash is farther right and lowest on the curve, then crypto is far left but higher on the curve.

You need to ask yourself if you’re comfortable losing the money. If the answer is yes, then you need to ask if you think Bitcoin is better than moving stocks (ie the S&amp;P 500 always comes back so if you invest monthly, over the long run you’ll be fine, do you feel the same about Bitcoin?). If the answer is yes, then consider leaving it. If the answer is no, then move it into something else.

Again, these are questions you have to answer yourself, but that’s how I’d approach it personally.",2021-01-03 23:39:58

semiconodon,"Okay this is honest, level-headed analysis. It’s about money, and real-world restraints in a world where jerks write bots. 

But as for the money, there are such things s as diminishing returns. In government finance, there’s talk of a Laffer Curve, where eventually ever higher and higher tax rates don’t get us to more government revenue. Do these get-rich schemes by IG (such as reaping cash by getting us to pay for exposure)  _really_ bring in more revenue, or do they just tick us off? And with these schemes do we end up with a soft version of the garbage you described above: instead of honest ads, we get the cruft of paid-for exposure.

restinstress,"Quick procedural question: is Handron teaching Differential Equations in the spring? I thought he only teaches it in the Fall, given that 1) I just took it with him this fall and 2) I’m taking Intro to Math Finance with him in the spring. If you mean “Fall 2021”, ignore this. 

DiffEq with Handron was a lot of fun, but sufficient work. The homeworks are reasonably challenging, but mostly harder than anything you’ll see on exams, the weekly quizzes are an easy way to boost your grade, and the online assignments are mostly trivial. He has a really lenient grading curve, where the cutoff for an A could be something like an 85%, so you don’t need to be that stressed about your grades either. I found the class to be moderately challenging, but I don’t think I hit the 9 hrs/week expectation of the course, even with attending all lectures and recitations. Reach out if you have any more specific questions, or if you need help throughout the semester. Good luck!",2021-01-04 09:37:13
Bankcliffpushoff,"10% of entire capital exposure in cash terms or total net wealth terms - this is NOT ‘house value’. This is ‘house value minus finance’.

The key is to stick to one metric, not change it every time you want to curve fit. 

I argue that liquid assets should be seen as their own investment (gold, stocks, rare items with liquidity e.g. Rolex, a car which is 1-2 years old etc.) 

*car is arguable 

So 
Make a list of liquid net assets. 
Make a list of illiquid net assets.

Look at debts specifically too and their deadlines.
E.g. a mate wanted to risk putting a LOT of money into a stock but owed credit card debt which ‘he thought he’d pay back within 30 days but somehow he always misses the deadline by a few weeks’ or so.

So it’s more about sticking to a strategy, than about which is best (out of the couple of examples I’ve outlined, in general - I’m sure there’s better metrics we can add to the mix. E.g. ‘is the stock likely to be removed from the ASX200 list soon, is it a risky sector, is it volatile, does it pay dividends, and can you invest in that stock in another way in an unusual but strategic way 

E.g. I saw interest rates going down, and the charts showed me a likely ‘cut’ in rates, alongside a very improved ‘covid’ situation in Australia (where I’m from), so I did some research, Google Trends analytics and some keyword searching = bought a couple of domain names in the ‘sector’ of finance. 

Loan__.com.au - don’t wanna put the full domain here in case the new owner doesn’t want that but, sold for $20,000 (AUD) 4 months after I purchased it for $10.50.

This is just one way. (Yes it is repeatable but that’s another post I’ll make later somewhere since off track a tiny bit)

Another way is to (in your case) add pilot positions.
Then as the stock goes up, add to it.

It sounds counterintuitive but I assure you the best traders, today and in the past (I mean fund managers, long term proven stars, not ‘3 months into trading’) will tell you the same.

Get into a stock with a ‘pilot position’ because once you’re in, your paying attention. 

Then set a ‘trailing’ stop loss. If you are a long term holder do NOT fall for the ‘nah I HODL’ idea. Sure, set the stop loss to like 20-25% drop, but do not wait till it is down 40-80% before you ‘exit’.

So before you decide on how much to allocate, understanding your ‘risk’ vs ‘actual risk’ and ‘actual actions’ vs ‘what you think you’ll do’ is more important.

A famous trader said once, (if you’re good follow) this ‘you can put most of your eggs in one basket, but then make sure you fkn watch that basket well’ (something like that).

For 90% of people this doesn’t work (it’s the mental gap between ‘knowing what to do’ vs ‘what you actually do when shit happens’).

Good old Tyson quote - ‘everyone has a plan till they get punched in the face’.

So more than ‘too much money’, focus on ‘too much risk’ or ‘too little experience’ etc. and try and answer these.

I hope I didn’t over confuse you. Pls don’t hate me if I did - I’ve been exactly where you are and taught many, for the love of it, and the ‘risk’ and money part gets kinda confused /twisted.

Risk management plan is more important.",2021-01-04 16:26:29

I would love to see some data. Even one number (other than you have two degrees, one of which is simply indicative of why this is a wall of text and not financial data).

&gt;Looks like a solid project and it seems that the team has been able to assemble some of the big hitters in the defi space, which is promising for stETH (Lido's eth2.0 derivative) integration in the various defi protocols. I am not so happy about the economics and distribution of the corresponding LDO governance token, as only 36% are allocated to the DAO-controlled treasury. That being said, there is no need to hold the LDO token in order to stake.

&gt;Just a heads-up, there is chatter about a Badger-style targeted airdrop for early adopters. Still early days but might be worth interacting with the protocol in case there is a successful governance vote.

The airdrop is currently being voted on

It looks like this first airdrop really only rewards stakers who have taken on additional risk by depositing ETH early on. The cutoff block was around 10 days after genesis. There are however ideas discussed in the governance forum to have a second airdrop with a future cutoff block. So it might be worth interacting with the protocol even if you’re not currently on the list.",2021-01-05 16:56:57

At first I lived with my parents, then I joined a year-long volunteer program which turned into a disaster after I was basically fired for having Bipolar (even though I really didn’t have symptoms... it’s a long story but they basically just wanted a reason to fire me).

MachineTeaching,"&gt;When the government tries to cut the economic pie in more equal slices, the pie gets smaller.

I think that is a bit too simplistic. I think it's also in an intro textbook and, depending on the surrounding context, sensible. You just want to illustrate tradeoffs and I can see how in macro-101-world a basic example of ""if we would redistribute all income perfectly there's less incentive to work hard"" isn't too bad of an example.

Nevertheless, the criticism isn't any better. The argument is that countries with low inequality can be rich, too. That doesn't disprove the argument that a high level of *redistribution* would lead to lower GDP or whatever else.

&gt;it is noteworthy that Mankiw describes income redistribution as a process in which the incentives for “working hard” would be reduced. This implies that people with high incomes work harder than those with low incomes. 

Eh I don't really think that's a reasonable implication. I'm pretty sure Mankiw doesn't actually think this.

&gt;Government can sometimes improve market outcomes

&gt;Mankiw freely admits that the market process in itself is not capable of providing all citizens with sufficient food, proper clothing and adequate health care. But for him, this does not necessarily imply a demand for state intervention. Rather, this depends on “one’s political philosophy.”

&gt;A completely different understanding of the state can be found in the classic description of state functions by the public finance specialist Richard A. Musgrave (1959), which in my opinion is still relevant today. He systematically distinguishes between the distribution function, the allocation function and the stabilization function of the state. 

Yeah but clearly it's still a matter of opinion to *which degree* a state fulfills these functions?

I mean, what is ""adequate"" housing, does a homeless shelter fall under adequate housing? What is ""adequate"" health care? Does that constitute simply ensuring access to healthcare, or does that mean everybody has a health insurance plan that is affordable to them? 

&gt;Under Principle 5 (“Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off”), Mankiw describes how trade (and thus ultimately a market economy) affects families. He comes to the conclusion that families compete against each other in shopping because each family wants to buy the best product at the lowest price. Apart from the fact that this is a misrepresentation of the economic principle, it is also an inaccurate description of the reality in a market economy. 

Of course people don't actually compete over cereal at Walmart or whatever. That doesn't mean that doesn't happen when it's relevant. Again, we're talking about an intro textbook making basic points.

&gt;Society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment”

&gt;Mankiw presents the relationship between inflation and unemployment as “Principle 10”. According to this principle, there is always a trade-off between inflation and unemployment in the short run. While Mankiw admits that some economists still question this relationship, he pretends that it is accepted by most economists.

Yeah, and I don't think it actually is? The Phillips curve is still valid, it's just more complicated in reality. Which is fine because this is still an intro textbook.

Also, see:

https://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2008/march/phillips-curve-inflation/

Of course you could argue that this section should be expanded somewhat. 

&gt;Minimum Wage Causes Unemployment

I do agree that you could expand on how that actually works in reality. I also understand that if you use the minimum wage as a basic example for a price floor, you might not want to get into monopsony power and all those things. 

&gt;Deflation leads the economy out of recession 

Okay, so the complaint seems to be that Mankiw ignores the ZLB? Again, you can argue how extensive you do or don't make an intro textbook. It's quite obvious that this is a factor that is indeed simply ignored. But again, it's a super basic model for an intro textbook.

&gt;Public debt reduces economic growth

I think that's the relevant part:

&gt;But even in the classical model framework, the result derived by Mankiw is anything but compelling. Rather, it arises from the implicit assumption that the government uses the funds it borrows exclusively for consumption. Moreover, it is characterized by the curious assumption that additional government demand for credit does not increase aggregate demand for credit, but reduces the supply of credit funds resulting from household saving. 

Which yes could be made clearer. Don't know if that happens elsewhere in the text or not.

&gt;Banks collect deposits, then lend them out as loans

Oh yeah that's actually one thing I agree on. I don't think the argument that this is an intro textbook holds here. While the other models are often basic versions of reality (although at times basic to the point of being wrong, which is fine as long as you're aware of that), I don't really like this approach. 

&gt;The perfect confusion in the small open economy

I actually recall this being confusing as well (I also used mankiws textbook as a student) so I agree here.

I agree with the last point as well.

All in all, a lot of nitpicks and some valid complaints. If that's the worst he can find, it's really not that bad tbh",2021-01-06 19:12:59
AxeLond,"I think those a good points and points out the hardest assumptions of that analysis.

The 37.6 PE made sense because that's the average for big companies today and if you assume that in 2030 Tesla will have similar growth plans for 2040. In reality assuming Tesla meets their forecast it would make Tesla the most profitable company in the world at 3x the second most profitable company, which ironically is Saudi Aramco selling oil today. Tesla would already run the world, and probably Mars as well.

Taking a look at some public massive companies and ignoring corona you have, Walmart going between 12-21, Royal Dutch Shell historically trading mostly 10-15 P/E. Volkswagen mostly 3-6 P/E, Apple 10-20 P/E. Going with fair P/E of 15 for a massive company you get a $1,740 price target.

The cost of equity I can't really say too much on, I'm more in engineering than finance, but it sounds like that's where they get you. You do your full analysis and as the final step you get ""Okay, what do you want the price target to be?"" and the excel spreadsheet calculates the cost of equity. Roughly 10% has been the average market rate over the past 80 years. The entire purpose of this was just to take Tesla at face value. We assume they're gonna meet their forecast. There is no risk because we assume that they will just do it, as a basis.

For the battery margin, I actually think it's possible to get it that high. In the really long term I don't think it's really sustainable to keep it that high, since it's still just a battery and kids in high school learn how to make those in chemistry class. However in the short term there will be insane inertia in the supply and demand curve of energy. Right now in the US enough energy can be produced profitably at $0.12/kWh to meet demand. 

If someone is operating a 40 year old nuclear plant with an average cost of $0.093/kWh and Tesla comes around and says, ""Hey, do you want to buy energy from our solar panels and batteries at a cost of $0.065/kWh?"" 

They'll say ""Great! I'll take 2GW worth of capacity."" for 12 hours of night that's 24GWh of batteries and 4-5GW of solar (around 2.5 mile square of solar panels). 24GWh is a bit less than Tesla's entire battery production today, but even at 3TWh it would only be enough to replace 125 nuclear reactors every year. There's currently 440 nuclear reactors operating in the world. To supply the entire world from batteries for 12 hours you would need 205 TWh of battery capacity. In 2030 Tesla will be able to supply 3TWh of that for $0.065/kWh, the rest of the world is still paying $0.141/kWh for electricity on average. What happens with the difference between $0.065/kWh and $0.141/kWh? That's your margin.

The 52% margins will stay until that 205 TWh demand of battery capacity is met. The average today is 160 g of Lithium per kWh of battery capacity. To do 205TWh you need 33 million metric tons of lithium metal.

Predictions are that by 2025 there will be [1.5 million tons](https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/articles/lithium-supply-is-set-to-triple-by-2025-will-it-be-enough) of Li2CO3 equivalent lithium production, which is 18.8% lithium by mass. So 300,000 tons lithium per year mined and 33 million tons of lithium metal needed to meet demand? Even if batteries can store and sell electricity at $0.065/kWh with solar, they'll be worth $0.141/kWh for a long ass time.",2021-01-07 01:44:22

WayOfTheMantisShrimp,"Long post incoming, three TLDRs at the bolded headings.  
This discussion comes up a lot, there are some fair points for each language. However, I feel like some R-advocates have a grudge about being told they are the underdog on their own turf, and the Python advocates have a large number of rather poor debaters among their ranks.

Background:  

- a couple years beyond a degree in statistics, with heavy focus on computational methods, and a couple years experience with data analyst work in finance. Not a professional programmer or SWE, I just do some programming
- started studying programming (OOP and functional) formally in 2007, have more than just passing experience with (in chronological order): Excel formulas, VBA, Java, Scheme, C, R, SQL, Python, Julia
- Was introduced to R in 2013, and it was instantly my favourite language (until I started playing with Julia about six months ago). Tried Python in 2014, and 2016, and dropped it because I didn't like it, then picked it back up in 2019 because now it's everywhere.

**About R:**  TLDR: R is great when you just want to get some analysis done

1. Nice for functional programming. I like that, meshes with the thinking of mathematics and Excel formulas. It counts starting at 1, like I've been doing since pre-school. Thinking in vectors and data frames was my default by the time I was introduced to R (a 'dictionary' is a data frame with a vector of keys, and a vector of values, I never cared about O(1) access in 95% of cases, it's still faster than a VLOOKUP)
2. R feels nice when you just have a question that needs to be answered by some data. There's no resistance to open a csv, check some summary statistics, plot a histogram or two on arbitrary variables, run a regularized regression, and make a simple plot. Faster than Excel I would say, especially with data.table and ggplot2, and this work flow is highly relevant to day-to-day analysis. RStudio complements this in every way, and there is some ergonomic value in having a default R IDE experience
3. R has generally high-quality implementations of a lot of the most common, and many uncommon statistical algorithms. R competes with Excel, Matlab, SPSS and the like, and I think is favoured for users that have the luxury of choice
4. I don't consider R a beginner-friendly language, I never recommend it as a first language to anyone but hardcore stats people; it has too many ways that it will let you screw yourself out of performance or consistent behaviour, and not much in the way of guard rails. It abstracts away a lot of the underlying machinery, which is great, but steepens the learning curve too. I still do recommend it to non-novice programmers looking for something suited to the work
5. I don't consider R as my go-to performant language if the entire task is at big-data scale. There are undoubtedly ways to make it work for 99% of users, R is not a deficient language, but they are not always ideal/elegant, and you start feeling that friction. The real answer is the C/C++/Fortran under the hood, which I feel is a compromise (ie learning to read those languages to check the nuts and bolts)
6. R is hard to 'share' with non-R-users; notebooks are great between analysts with R installed, but they aren't at the level of ""double-click to run"" packaged apps, or as ubiquitous as spreadsheets. Fair mention of RMarkdown to make html/pdf docs though, I think they are a key for professional use of R

**About Python:** TLDR: Python makes it easier for experienced programmers to work with the huge number of junior Python coders that are able to flood the market 

1. Python permits you to do functional programming. But object oriented programming is great in a team-project setting, or inter-team. It formalizes and highlights the interoperability of different pieces. The rigidity of linking behaviours to data helps (a little) to keep sloppy coders out of trouble (R lets you do anything to anything, and probably won't even throw a warning). OOP is not my favourite but Python does make it easier, especially compared to R. And like OP I didn't quite click with R's objects until I got into Julia structs.
2. Python is general purpose: any programmer can justify learning it, any teacher can justify teaching it. There is a library for anything you can imagine and more. It competes with Java, C++, LISP, Ruby, and a lot of others, and I think it is the most approachable as a jack of all trades, master of none. Having a language you can use for everything\* is valuable. Having a large user base to learn from is even more valuable, which is the positive feedback loop that blew up Python without a marketing budget.
3. Python is easy to teach beginners that have little to no programming background, *especially* if they have little other programming background. Everyone can grasp 'not', 'or', 'and' easier than !, ||, &amp;&amp;. I've watched several blank slates pick up the conventions faster than I would expect (they don't ask about where to put the data type, or the curly braces, or the semi-colon), and base Python is quite consistent with itself, making for a smooth but not slow learning curve.
4. Python enforces logical indentation, my favourite thing about the language. It is a guardrail for the barest basics of readability, which is a godsend for reading the code of others, including past-you and past-me. That sort of ergonomic style is what I would choose to make my co-workers and predecessors use if I could, especially the ones that didn't formally learn programming practices.
5. Base Python does not have vectors/arrays, matrices, or any native tabular data structure. It's not even trying to be a math/science/data analysis language. If people like to use it that way, they can, it's become rather easy. But those dependencies start eating away at the consistency that makes Python elegant. (For base R, it is basic string manipulation that needs supplementing)
6. Python is nice to read and write (important!), but it's not fast without knowing some tricks and having some libraries in low-level languages, just like R. It is often ""fast enough"", which should not be overlooked, but at big-data scales Python is really more of an API than an implementation. You're still going to learn C to see under the hood. I also haven't gotten good results from parallel computing methods.
7. For such a polished/established language, the lack of a 'standard issue' IDE was a friction point for me. Settled on VS Code and am mostly happy, but configuring the environment was not effortless for me like RStudio.

\**gets on soapbox*\*  
**About Julia** TLDR: has limitations, but does a lot of stuff really well, and it overlaps pretty well with the requirements of data analysis/science

1. It is a proper high-level language, it can be written a lot like Python (positive thing), though without the enforced indentation (each block having an explicit 'end' is a partial consolation). It supports functional and object-oriented language almost equally (and painlessly) in my opinion
2. It counts the first index as 1, as it should. Vectors, matrices, linear algebra, statistics/probability functions, mathematical operators and more are all efficiently implemented in the standard library (notably absent DataFrames.jl, but it fits in well enough). AND string manipulation is decent. It feels natural to use base Julia for simple tasks.
3. Performance is effortless. You can write for-loops and not suffer; heck you can write parallel for-loops by adding 9 characters and it will 'just work' and scale better than most 'vectorized' code in R/Python, which is part of the core library (race conditions may apply, it doesn't fix those for you). If you can make strong assumptions about types, then add those for a little bit more efficiency in memory use, but otherwise just write it generically and multiple dispatch will usually make it 'just work'. 'Vectorized' notation is also moderately efficient in the core language if you prefer it for readability, and can be applied to literally any/every function, and I'll say it again, it just works. List comprehensions have their place too, writes a lot like Python.
4. Julia competes with R and Python for high-level ease of data analysis and scientific computing, but also C++/Java for versatility and performance, and even C/Fortran for absolute efficient use of resources. It literally tries to do it all, solving the two-language problem, and it is an astoundingly good effort. You want to write a fast library for Julia? Write it in Julia, no other languages required in most cases. Even most of Julia is written in Julia.
5. Julia is not trying to take over the world's codebases on its own, overnight. It has inherent interoperability with Python, R, C++, C, Fortran, and Java so you can still recycle your existing code base at all points in time. I see that as making a smooth transition for those that want to.
6. The  custom Julia-centric IDE has ceased development, but the active community is largely unified behind VS Code as the 'standard' experience. Not as polished as RStudio, not much different from configuring Python in VS Code, but I found it satisfactory.
7. The community is small. Really active, enthusiastic (can you tell?), and making primarily high-quality contributions (no shortage of ML and scientific libraries), but it doesn't make up for Julia not having the massive resources (tutorials, libraries, StackOverflow questions answered) available for Python. And some don't care for the provided documentation, which is tough when alternatives are scarce.
8. Julia has a similar problem with being shared to non-Julia users, which is the majority of the world. Pluto.jl Notebooks are a start for reproducing between users, Markdown docs are a good step to non-programmers, and PackageCompiler.jl is working on it, but it's not robust yet. Possibly the only thing it can't replace is the ubiquity and gentle learning curve of Excel.",2021-01-07 11:09:43
supenguin,"I am switching from primarily using a Mac to Linux so that kind of limits my options a bit! I've still got my old Mac and still running stuff in parallel.

If you're comfortable rolling your own spreadsheet, I'd say do that since that gives you 100% control of how things work.

I've heard good things about SEE Finance.

Personally I ended up on Moneydance. I had used it before Banktivity and even before YNAB. They don't do subscriptions, you get whatever version comes after what you bought for free and then updates are only 1/2 price of the app (after which the next update is free). It's powerful, it's been around for a while, runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. There is a learning curve. And it's not the prettiest thing in the world, but who really cares about that when it comes to a personal finance app? Their trial is up to 100 transactions and I think that is just manually entered transactions so hopefully you could download the trial and give importing a shot.

Updating security prices has required a plugin. They have some other good plugins including one that forecasts future account balances based on past transactions rather than scheduled transactions.

The only other possible downside you bring up is support - the Moneydance support is through [tenderapp.com](https://tenderapp.com) which feels more like forums than a support ticket system. They do tend to respond within a day or two.",2021-01-07 11:53:24

Spottedcowz,"Man, you are just on about this minimum wage thing, aren't you?

You assume hypocrisy because you have a very shallow and superficial understanding of finance.  Raising the minimum wage as a way of combating poverty is not particularly effective.  The absolute value of money paid to a person is irrelevant. What matters is the amount of money they have in relationship to everyone else.  If I have a dollar, here in real world 2021, that's not much money.  But in analogy land where the entire country only has $100 total, well, then I'm incredibly wealthy.

So if we raised the minimum wage AND prices didn't change, it would be effective.  That's an unrealistic and naive belief, however.  Cost of labor goes up, prices will rise to follow.  It does change the ratio a little bit, but it mostly flattens the curve between poor, middle class and upper middle class - it doesn't affect the wealthy at all.

An example would be if the government sent everyone a check for a million dollars tomorrow. That wouldn't result in everyone being rich, it would just result in some really nasty inflation.  It WOULD more or less eliminate any financial difference between someone making 18k/yr and someone making 50k/yr. And it would be a significant hit to someone with a million dollars, who would see the value of their extant million drop precipitously, but it wouldn't even be a noticeable hit to a billionaire. Meanwhile, our 18k/yr. shlub isn't materially better off - prices will have risen enough that they'll still just be getting by.

Money doesn't have any intrinsic value.  It's just a lubricant for trade.  The value is in the goods and services you can trade it for.  Printing more money doesn't make more goods and services available.

And you can do localized minimum wage increases without affecting the country too much.  Seattle raising their minimum wage doesn't have a huge impact on national inflation, because they represent a fairly small portion if the economy.  Doing it nationwide? You'd see a noticeable increase in the price of nearly everything.  At the end of the day, for every person getting more than their fair share, someone else is getting less.  Not just on a nationwide scale, but on a worldwide one.  The standard of living in the US is propped up by exploitation of developing nations.  The rich here are just doing the same on an intranational scale as well, and that is the problem with income inequality.  Lifting the poor up by bringing the middle class down is not a good solution - it doesn't make big enough changes for the poor and it doesn't address the issue that so much of our wealth has accumulated at the very top.

But you believe that the other ""side"" is just hypocritical and mean because you don't have a good grasp of the nuance of the policies they espouse.  And I'm not mad at you about it, that's an issue common to virtually everyone that identifies as left or right.  And the few partisan people who do actually understand the likely knock-on effects of these platforms are just using their knowledge to manipulate the bumper sticker and 144 character ideologies of the masses for their own enrichment.",2021-01-08 06:54:41

San Diego was built in large part the way it is because of the geographic features of up 200 feet to the top of the canyon, down 200 feet to the base of the canyon, up 200 feet to the top of the canyon, down 200 feet to the bottom of the canyon, lather rinse repeat.   There have been TV documentaries of how the canyons promote species extinction because the area in the canyon is too small for a viable population and the top of the canyons where all the housing is is too formidable a barrier to species movement.   But I digress.

Tell ya what, when you can get them to eliminate height limits at Bay Park, build some high rises that can handle at least half a million people and put a trolley extension through downtown La Jolla, I promise I'll be attentive.  Oh, and teach all the million or so people to be good neighbors who understand that living cheek by jowl is not a license to go hog wild (gee I'm getting poetic this evening), but an obligation to be polite.

2.1 billion dollars, all the earth moved, concrete poured, metal forged, electricity generated (seemingly forever) for the trolley, lives disrupted, and on and on for a measly 13,500 people trips a day. Let's assume a 30 year life for the trolley, electric cost is zero, no maintenance and that no loans were taken out to finance the project, we're talking 20 dollars a rider over that time period.

So let's spend tens times that amount, eminent domain things in the way (La Jolla Farms?  The Mormon Temple?) and hey johnny johnny we're up to 135,000 rides a day out of 22+ million.  Let's go for broke (perhaps literally), spend 3.4 Trillion with a T and we can get all 22+ million rides on mass transit!  And all on the shoulders of the middle class and poor while the money'd get their homes in La Jolla or Rancho Santa Fe and don't have to deal with all those hoi palloi mucking up their freeways.  Oh, and just another few billions for the skyscrapers.

Mass transit would be great ya know, except for the dang masses. (shudder).

WryLawTalkingGuy,"I think your pre-law school experience is going to be more important to your own personal professioal development than it will be to an employer. If you have experience in management, you'll be better at management when you're given that responsibility. If you have experience in finance, you'll be better at dealing with client financial  issues. Your future employers are unlikely to be very impressed with skills like these. They will expect you to get the job done regardless of your learning curve. And if they don't have these skills, they're not likely to value them.

I would highly recommend getting some real world professional experience before law school. It makes the coursework in law school more relevant, and it makes you overall more employable later because employers will assume you've got work basics down (show up on time, don't bitch about overtime, know when to keep your mouth shut, etc.).

Besides, you might get lucky and it will lead you to a career other than law :)

Best advice I could give you today is pour every spare dollar and every spare minute into LSAT prep. Even a couple points improvement can mean thousands (or tens of thousands) in student loans covered by scholarships rather than your future earnings.

ReichMarshallNimitz,"&gt; Yes, but the upper-bound in CS is high. Basically you are saying “the normal curve exists guys”. Like, ok...yeah I agree. And if you do something be at the top of the curve.
&gt; 
&gt; Posts like this irritate me because they have accurate data, but readers will think “oh CS pays like anything else, not worth the bother”. No. It pays well. If you want to be average that is fine, but if I want to do something I don’t shoot to be average at it. I don’t know anyone who does something and just wants to be plain break “ok”.

While you are right in that the curve for CS is much higher than something like accounting or education, the curve is not as high as majors like Finance or marketing. Top salesman and fund managers pull in millions per year, it's not even close. Some of the top finance guys make more money than should be ethically possible.

I would argue that the upper-bound in CS is not high, rather that the average is the high value. The average CS major will make more than the average marketing or finance major, but top marketing or finance majors will make more than top CS majors.

The ""closer"" you are to the money, the more money you tend to make. That's how all business' operate. People with further proximity to profit (like humanities majors) tend to make less, while engineers/CS tend to be in the middle, while management/finance will be the closest to the money and therefore make the most. However, because of limited spots at that top tier of finance/management, most (meaning the average) professional will not make those figures (despite the high upper-bound).",2021-01-08 17:40:11
docpurple5891,"Using this to have the best chance of reaching others.

After scraping through as many threads and forums as I could as well as talking with several other people, online, family, coworkers, etc., two of which are very experienced in money management and software, I have come to a solution. It's not as pretty as Simple was, but I might actually end up liking it better in the long run.

I have decided to use One Finance for my ""replacement"" to Simple. They have a couple features already in place that are good enough for me to feel comfortable as well as talk directly from them about adding many similar features or direct clones as Simple.

Then, to account for the budgeting aspect, I have decided to use YNAB (You Need A Budget). It will be different. It will be a learning curve. It will not be ""fun."" It will, however, stay with me no matter which bank(s) I use though and I shouldn't have this same issue again for future. I have direct sources who are long-time users of YNAB and they said they have had very little issues with their accounts syncing and that the developers stay on top of issues really well.

I will wait and see what PNC decides to do with their new acquisition as I've heard reports from current users that they've dropped a lot of functionality they previously had. This could be indication of plans to implement a lot of Simple's functionality, but I'm not personally waiting around to see how badly they screw everything up while also trying to be able to use and access my money and maintain a budget.",2021-01-09 03:23:12

MachineTeaching,"&gt;I'm reading Stephanie Kelton's 'The Deficit Myth,' and wondering why the US government issues securities at all

Because that is aside from taxes one of the primary ways how governments finance themselves. They are essentially very cheap but also very secure loans to the government.

&gt;since it can just print as much money as it wants

It can't, really. It's not like there is any sort of fixed limit, but you would eventually get inflation, and as you rely on money printing more and more, more inflation. That's how you get hyperinflation, which is an economic desaster.

And yes, the MMT counterargument to that is that you could raise taxes and take money out of the economy again, but that argument is in all honesty kinda dumb. If you print X amount of money and then take out X amount of money via taxes you haven't actually created any more money in practice.

&gt;Is it to control inflation?

In the real world, the central bank controls inflation via typical tools like OMOs and when necessary through unconventional monetary policy like QE.

MMT thinks monetary policy is useless and that the IS curve is vertical. [Which it isn't.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/b9ktk9/comment/ek8sd9q)

If what you see in the real world doesn't match up with MMT, that's not surprising because MMT is mostly wrong.",2021-01-09 19:33:09

ozozznozzy,"This is literally my favorite subject and I'm an actual studied mathematician (admittedly work in finance now).

Infinity is very complex. People hear it, and the idea of it is so big, that they immediately assume it means everything. That just isn't true. Another redditor used a base 2 number system to make the point, but I'll add this, there are infinite numbers between 1 and 2, and none of them are 3. There are an infinite number of prime numbers, but none of them are 21. 

If I drop a nail on the ground, there are an infinite number of ways it could be oriented. 

There are an infinite number of distances between any two stars.

All that being the case, there is an approaching 0 probability that a random cluster of dots on a paper resemble any pattern of stars in the sky from earth or any other universal angle. This probability gets closer to zero with each new dot. 

This was a huge debate when Rick and Morty came out as people were arguing about the infinite universes vs central finite curve. In reality it is unlikely, even with infinite universes, that any of them have a planet that resembles Earth, let alone a similar group of humans with a similar history. It's probably more likely that most of the infinite parallel universes never had a big bang at all.",2021-01-10 14:56:41

VTDMAN7,"I think you should decide this based on your future goals imo. If you want to be an engineer or go into finance or be a math/applied math/stats major then probably pick BC but if you want to do other things then probably pick Stats. Doing a max of Calc AB is fine for engineering or math majors in high school but the problem in your case will be that you will have a years gap which can hurt your math skills. Stats is very useful and will help you in a lot of careers but is very different from the rest of math so you will have a big gap in your education. If sat you had taken AB in senior year then it would be fine because there would be no gap. Also first semester of BC will basically be AB and second semester senior year doesn’t really matter in terms of grades unless you really mess up. So think about your future goals and then decide. I used to be not weak but not strong either at math up till like 6th-7th grade but I still did the work an struggled and I’m very good at math now. There’s always a learning curve and once you get past that things become really easy or much more bearable at least. Just don’t approach your work with the attitude that you hate it. Try to actually enjoy it even fake enjoying it and you’ll start hating it less. Also wait for the rest of the year to finish to see how good/bad you’ll do at AB. You could take both BC and Stats well that’s what I’m doing this year as a senior. Also if you’re in online school, that may be a reason you’re hating calculus.

Romeo_Santos-,"This is bs.

I heard from a friend who did not know anyone in this class about it. Apparently he put in so much work and was getting 90's in the problem sets. He would have finished with an 80 but he got curved down to a 72.

Everyone at Rotman knows that certain profs (cough,cough... Michael Khan) use the final exam as a way to curve down students' marks and bring them down to the desired average.

This is such a lack of understanding for students and their grades; as if UofT was not hard enough. No wonder the mental health at UofT is awful.

My recommendation: if you want to do Finance, switch to Management with a focus in Finance so you avoid taking ECO300 level courses, as well as ECO209 (really tough course).  
Finance and Econ is not worth it. 

Also, do not take ECO339 or ECO364. Both are awfully hard and have low averages",2021-01-13 07:36:01
ronin_zulu," The way I see it you have 3 options. Thankfully, they are not mutually exclusive so you can work on a combination of these.

1. Get a higher paying job and slowly pay down the debt. I worked as an accountant for a while and although getting a CPA provides you with a better salary, you will have to work 1-2 years at a pretty average salary (50k-60k) and working long hours as you alluded to. Also, it requires an extra 2 years of study and a certification exam which you can't realistically complete while working full time. If you run back-of-the-envelope maths, with 100k salary (50k after taxes) and limited expenses (2k/month), you can pay $4k/month of debt which would take you about 4 years to pay down your debt. However, if you can only pay down $1k/month, it would take you 19 years...
2. Default on the loan. I am not sure this can be done while shielding your parents from any consequences but it's worth exploring. As someone else already mentioned, defaults are eventually dropped off your credit report but for such a large amount, Im inclined to think they will hunt you down forever and seize any assets you eventually purchase. I dont recommend that option.
3. Start a side hustle. This is what I did when I was in a similar situation (although my debt was much smaller) in my mid-twenties. I was also coming out of business school and did not want to wait decades to pay down my debt and achieve some financial flexibility. I started by tutoring accounting and finance on the side then made it a business and hired other tutors. There is definitely a learning curve in starting a side hustle or business but the risk is limited and the upside is significant. It is also much easier to make a side income online today than it was 10 years ago when I did it.

My recommendation is to keep/get a decent paying job, be frugal and aim to make some extra money online selling your services (tutoring, bookkeeping for local small businesses, etc.). Then you can expand and make it a business. If you can put $4k-5k per month to pay down your debt, you will be out of this mess within 4 years.

This is not an insurmountable debt and you can definitely solve this. However, I think it requires a bit of creativity and thinking outside the box if you dont want to work 70 hours/week for the next 20 years.",2021-01-13 09:20:24
dfj2025,"Watch the video from Hans.  It has a really good insight into the economy.

There was time when interest rates were 15%.   Whenever the economy started to slow down they would be lowered to get the economy going again.  It's just since 9/11 and the 2008 banking crisis interest rates have been so low they no longer matter.

The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate:
https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/what-economic-goals-does-federal-reserve-seek-to-achieve-through-monetary-policy.htm#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Reserve%20works%20to,moderate%20long%2Dterm%20interest%20rates.

There is NOTHING federal about the Federal Reserve. It's a corporation where board members are prominent members of the banking industry.   

I'm not a big fan of fiat currencies.  Inflation is a hidden tax making sure everyone is suffering with debts that can never really be paid off.  Here's a really good video on the evils of our monetary and banking system:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDlnM481Gcg
It's a little long but I've watched twice now.  If we are going to have a fiat currency then the Federal Reserve needs better tools for ensuring the dual mandate is achieved.  

The Federal Reserve doesn't call it UBI.  They call it ""helicopter money"": 
https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/082216/what-difference-between-helicopter-money-and-qe.asp#:~:text=Helicopter%20money%20involves%20the%20central,or%20scattered%20from%20a%20helicopter.
I think UBI would pay for itself in tax revenues and by making the dollar more valuable through people's greed to spend it.  The problem we have now is to much money is in too few hands.  I believe as money gets concentrated into fewer hands it becomes intrinsically worth less.  The more people in general having money the more overall greed there is for people to want to have more of it.  Say someone has UBI and income from a minimum wage job.  When people get into the habit of spending more money they will want more of it.  Right now what we have is people have so little what's the point of even trying when everything costs so much.  Check out this video:
https://tcf.org/content/commentary/video-wealth-inequality-in-the-u-s-is-worse-than-you-think/
It's funny how people try to discredit this video.  But the facts remain no matter how much people try to convey an opinion to the contrary.

The problem with the politicians is no matter how they try to spin it you can't dispute the facts.

I think UBI is the answer because it allows the Fed another tool to cause the economy to begin to accelerate.  The problem with the US and World economy is it's a BIG ship with a small rudder.

nailpolishlover12,"1. Yes, downpayment savings and emergency fund should be in a high yield savings. I use Ally. I like it. They’re all the same basically so you can use whoever you want. 

2. I would do retirement savings and paying off the loans at the same time. I’d be fine with you just doing the 5% into 401k (what you’re doing now) and save the Roth or non retirement investing for after the loans are paid off. Although if you can afford to put a little in a Roth I’d start that as early as possible. Early contributions are key here. I wouldn’t do any non retirement investing at all until after you are debt free. Contributing 15% personally to retirement and have the house. Those are all more important things than regular investing. 

3. Yes. I’d like for you to do both. Early retirement investing is key to major growth even if it’s just small amounts while you pay off the loans. 

The other poster is giving you the Dave Ramsey baby step approach. I’m a huge Dave Ramsey fan. Get his book the total money makeover and read it. He is the financial independence guru for dummies. His plan works, but his plan isn’t the only plan that works. Use his plan as a guide and modify for your needs. For example, he says a $1,000 emergency fund is enough and he has really good reasoning behind that, but I disagree that $1,000 is enough for most people for a Heath emergency or car emergency so personally I like 3 months of living expenses as a minimum. He also will tell you not to invest at all until you are completely debt free. This is good advice, but if you are smart about it I think you can find more success doing both.

DougFane,"Because that isn't actually socialism? The presence of a safety net is honestly largely irrelevant to me, but for what it's worth I personally support it. The real question at issue is how you generate the labor and capital required to produce those safely nets along with all the other things it takes to run a modern and competitive society, and the answer to that question has been shown time and time and time again to be access to free markets and clear incentives to innovate, work hard, and take risks.

At the end of the day, if what you want is a robust social safety net and an improved quality of life for the average laborer, there's really not much question that capitalist systems are the best way to finance that.

The only real limitation on a capitalist society's ability to create those nets is the Laffer curve and the political will to enact them, with the former being a mostly theoretical concern. In socialist states it is actually a very pressing problem. More importantly, literally every ""successful"" attempt at implementing socialism on a broad scale and for a long time has necessarily involved a strong central government and a command economy, both of which are so ripe for abuse that I can't think of a single example of a country that has lasted for more than a few generations that didn't collapse or become a complete dystopia.

I strongly suspect that what you actually want is to become more like a Nordic state, and they will be the first to tell you that they are not socialist. Calling it socialism is only going to make it less likely for the people who oppose you to get their way, because there are a lot of people who have a logical and understandable fear of that idea.",2021-01-14 17:30:47

# White House document reveals US plan to defend Taiwan

 

**‘BOLSTER ALLIES AND COUNTER CHINA’**

Mr O’Brien said it demonstrates America’s strategic commitments to not only the Indo-Pacific but its regional allies and partners, ensuring preservation and protection of their sovereignty.

“This confirms that US strategic policy in the Indo-Pacific was in substantial part informed and driven by allies and partners, especially Japan, Australia and India,” Professor Rory Medcalf, head of the Australian National University’s National Security College, [said in his analysis of the document for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/declassification-of-secret-document-reveals-real-us-strategy-in-the-indo-pacific/).

“Contrary to concerns that the Trump administration was veering to a one-dimensional, military-led external policy, there was a clear recognition of the need for holistic engagement to bolster allies and counter China, across the full spectrum from information operations to advanced technology research and infrastructure investment.

“Whether America has the capacity, co-ordination and will to follow through on such a total strategy is another question.”

One objective within the plan is to align with the strategies of Australia, India and Japan, creating a “quadrilateral security framework” and having the four nations as “principal hubs”.

The strategy also includes “accelerating India’s rise” and having a strong India as a “counterbalance to China”. It repeatedly refers to the “US Strategic Framework for Countering China’s Economic Aggression”.

Australia’s experience with China influenced the drafting of the US strategy.*Source:News Regional Media*

A senior US official told [*Axios*](https://www.axios.com/indo-pacific-strategy-trump-administration-china-377b965c-6cf8-4299-a230-c0e869bb4d73.html) “a lot of credit” has to be given to Australia and its experience with [China](https://www.news.com.au/topics/china), which influenced the drafting of the strategy.

“In many ways they were ahead of the curve in understanding influence operations and interference in domestic systems,” the official said.

Speaking after the release of the framework, former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the Australian Government had a “clear-eyed, realistic view of the tensions in the region” at the time, including the need to maintain and bolster alliances and “stand up against coercion”.

“We took a number of measures, [banning Chinese vendors and the 5G network](https://www.news.com.au/technology/gadgets/mobile-phones/huawei-banned-from-australian-5g-network/news-story/d1d6ec001747ba51e7c5c8738021f7ee), we did that in advance of the United States,” he told [*ABC News Breakfast*](https://twitter.com/BreakfastNews/status/1349105285575544838) on Wednesday.

“We obviously legislated to protect Australia from foreign interference.”

He described the document as a “thoughtful” statement of America’s strategic priorities in the Indo-Pacific.

But the problem is President Trump’s foreign policy has been “erratic and inconsistent”, Mr Turnbull added.

 

**‘MAJOR POWER MILITARY CONFRONTATION’**

In regards to China, the US framework includes devising and implementing a defence strategy capable of “denying China sustained air and sea dominance inside the first island chain in a conflict” and “defending the first island chain nations, including Taiwan”.

“Objective: Enable Taiwan to develop an effective asymmetric defence strategy and capabilities that will help ensure its security, freedom from coercion, resilience, and ability to engage China on its own terms,” it states.

The “First Island Chain” [covers the South and East China Seas](https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/military/experts-warn-of-chinas-growing-offensive-capability/news-story/f7b4dc7fd02a422a77409881fc2a99c4) encompassed by the Kuril Islands, Japan, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, the Philippines, Borneo, Malaysia and Indonesia.

Professor Gordon Flake from the University of Western Australia's Perth USAsia Centre told [*ABC Radio*](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/am/security-document/13053186): “It (Taiwan) is the one area where I think major power military confrontation is probably most feasible so in that context, that’s one that certainly has to be discussed.”

There is an enduring defence alliance between Australia and the US.

In summarising the history, [the Australian Embassy states](https://usa.embassy.gov.au/defence-cooperation#:~:text=History%20of%20Australia%2DUnited%20States,East%20Timor%2C%20Afghanistan%20and%20Iraq.): “Australians have fought alongside Americans in every major US military action of the last century, including World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq.”

In other words, if America was to take on China in defence of Taiwan, it’s assumed that Australia would jump to our ally’s aid – despite our increasing reliance on China as a crucial trading partner over the years.

**THE CHINA-AUSTRALIA FALLOUT**

However, Australia’s relationship with China has deteriorated significantly in recent months.

The stoush kicked off with the Huawei ban and foreign interference laws in 2018.

The list of trade sanctions grew in mid 2020 when China slapped tariffs on barley and suspended some beef exports.

In recent days, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg [again blocked a proposed Chinese takeover](https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/other-industries/chinas-bid-for-australian-construction-giant-probuild-blocked-on-national-interest-grounds/news-story/0839ac95205bcce9c7b0e072f09fa9da) of Melbourne-headquartered construction giant Probuild.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao [on Tuesday said it was the latest example](https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/discriminatory-beijing-lashes-josh-frydenberg-over-rejected-takeover-bid/news-story/daa820cde6b72377ce92120da366bee1) of Australia “imposing discriminatory measures on Chinese companies”.",2021-01-14 20:39:24

I think an easy route for someone looking to develop apps is by first learning a programming language on a site like HackerRank, and then building a few small projects useful to the developer (even if there are a million similar apps on the store). 

You may want to start with a project where you can use external APIs to retrieve all of your data...For example maybe an app the displays current stock prices which you can retrieve from yahoo finance or another site easily.

ChewieBearStare,"I  wrote a whole long comment, hit Comment, and it's missing. Let me try again.

1. Take Sarah's quizzes (look under Course Tips for a list of class resources. I completed the course a while back, so I forget the exact name--something like ""Macroeconomics Quick Quizzes"").
2. Learn how to draw the graphs so that even if the wording is tripping you up, you can draw it out and know the answer.
3. Remember that the long-run aggregate supply curve only shifts with a change in technology or resources. That tip alone saved my bacon on several questions. I had no clue what the answer should be, but on questions with no change in technology/resources, three of the answers mentioned the LRAS shifting and only one said that the LRAS would stay the same, so I knew that that had to be the correct answer.
4. Know how to calculate opportunity cost.
5. Remember that changes in price cause movement along the curve; they do not cause the curve to shift. 
6. Memorize  half of the chart located about halfway down the page at this link: [https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-macroeconomics/ap-financial-sector/monetary-policy-apmacro/a/monetary-policy](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-macroeconomics/ap-financial-sector/monetary-policy-apmacro/a/monetary-policy). The title starts ""Monetary policy influences aggregate demand..."" When you start your OA, write down what you remember on your whiteboard. If you know that one causes unemployment to increase, then the other causes unemployment to decrease, so you only need to memorize the info for one type of policy (expansionary or contractionary), not both.

For breadth as bcom id recommend either of these
- mast10005 (if you did well in methods its a great choice and should boost the email while being quite useful)
- unib10006 (ngl just found out about this class but would help with econometrics)
- comp10001 (great to have some level of understanding of comp sci and python for finance industry)

A pre standard first sem course plan would be;
S1:
Pof, ara, qm1, breadth
S2:
Lvl2 com,ifa1 or another lvl2 com,  intro micro, breadth
(Can do intro macro s1 2022/2nd yr just fine)
After this id recommend deciding if you want to major in acc (acc in uni is incredibly hard to score well in due to being marked on a v harsh curve). Bc in all honesty uni acc just ain't the same as hs and is so dry compared to more interesting majors putting it very bluntly, econ/metrics is a far more interesting major. But you should study what you feel you'll enjoy and score best in (compare you qm1 marks to your ara)

Also if you wanna work in finance, accounting isnt an essential major. You could always major in econ and take units focused in econometrics and finance (like econ30024, ecom30002, econ30025, ecom30004 and/or econ30020 as you major cores).

joenorwood77,"yearn.finance price today is $34,998.30 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $797,406,767 USD. yearn.finance is up 12.94% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #38, with a market cap of $1,048,856,858 USD. It has a circulating supply of 29,969 YFI coins and a max. supply of 30,000 YFI coins.

The top exchanges for trading in yearn.finance are currently Binance, Huobi Global, BiKi, OKEx, and HBTC. 


What Is Yearn.Finance (YFI)?

Yearn.finance is an aggregator service for decentralized finance (DeFi) investors, using automation to allow them to maximize profits from yield farming.

Its goal is to simplify the ever-expanding DeFi space for investors who are not technically minded or who wish to interact in a less committal manner than serious traders.

Launched in February 2020, the service, formerly known as iEarn, has seen huge growth in recent months as new products debuted and developers released in-house token YFI.


Who Are the Founders of Yearn.Finance?

Yearn.finance is the brainchild of Andre Cronje. After leaving the iEarn project in February 2020, Cronje returned to oversee a rebirth, with new tools emerging and YFI going live in July.

Since then, its fortunes have turned around, with assets under total value locked coming in at just over $1 billion as of the end of September 2020.

Cronje has a long career in cryptocurrency and has become synonymous with DeFi in particular. He also has positions at smart contract ecosystem Fantom and CryptoBriefing, a resource dedicated to initial coin offerings (ICOs) and crypto media.


What Makes Yearn.Finance Unique?

Yearn.finance set out to simplify DeFi investment and activities such as yield farming for the broader investor sector.

The platform makes use of various bespoke tools to act as an aggregator for DeFi protocols such as Curve, Compound and Aave, bringing those who stake cryptocurrency the highest possible yield.

New features continue to be rolled out, these aiming, among other things, to help preserve the long-term value of the platform.

Yearn.finance makes a profit by charging withdrawal fees, currently 0.5% at the end of September 2020, as well as 5% gas subsidization fees. Due to its governance model, these can technically be changed by consensus at any time.

The target market for yearn.finance is investors who do not have the time to study the increasingly complex DeFi phenomenon from scratch, or who wish to optimize their returns.


How Many Yearn.Finance (YFI) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Yearn.finance in-house token YFI has a fixed supply of 30,000 coins. There was no premine upon launch in July 2020, and developers did not receive any starting funds: the total supply at launch was 0 YFI.

Since then, the majority of the capped supply has entered circulation, and the success of the token is reflected in its all-time high price of $41,000, which it hit in mid-September 2020. YFI was also the first cryptocurrency to become worth more than Bitcoin (BTC) per unit.

Users of yearn.finance earn YFI through providing liquidity, while token holdings dictate governance privileges.


How Is the Yearn.Finance Network Secured?

Yearn.finance users can face a high risk of losing money thanks to market conditions changing rapidly and opportunistic entities attempting to profit from less-experienced participants.

Cronje himself has sought to maintain transparency about the platform’s provenance, noting that even after code audits, yearn.finance could not be guaranteed to be 100% safe — DeFi involves inherent risk.


Where Can You Buy Yearn.Finance (YFI)?

YFI is a freely-tradable token, with pairs for cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and fiat currencies all widely available.

Major exchanges trading YFI include Binance, OKEx and Huobi Global, as well as automated market maker (AMM) Uniswap.",2021-01-17 09:59:21
deficryptodan,"You are asking a lot of good questions, which would take a lot of time to answer.  I try to do that in my [podcast](https://realdefi.buzzsprout.com/) (The Real DeFi Podcast), you're welcome to listen - I cover all the below and more in great detail.  

In short:

* Transactions are expensive.  Cost varies greatly depending on the transaction complexity and gas cost.  Anywhere between $5 and $40 if you trade during low-cost times.
* I would say $1000 per farm is too little.  If that is the amount you have, I would look at automatic solutions like those provided by Yearn Finance or indeed Harvest Finance (FARM).  They do most of the farming work for you and you can keep your funds for a while.
* Providing liquidity for ETH pairs (non-stablecoins) can be lucrative, but you face impermanent loss.  You have to know what you are doing and monitor closely.
* Some interesting projects: Curve, Sushi, Yearn Finance, Badger.  

My advice: start slowly and build your way up.",2021-01-17 17:24:56
shamusotool,"Depends if you're looking at ATM or OTM. Decay curve starts to accelerate heavily around 17-14 dte for ATM strikes, but for OTM strikes decay decelerates around 21 dte.

It's one of the weird things about options from a more academic approach. Almost all academic literature focuses on ATM options. Obviously there's a shit ton of people trading ATM options as the volume is usually heaviest there but my pure guess is that most retail trading is at OTM strikes. 

I'm curious about u/chaney3 's take here as he has more background knowledge than me although I know he doesn't have a traditional educational route. 

I've done a few MBA finance classes that were cool from an intellectual curiosity standpoint but I don't think I got anything at all from them that helped my trading.",2021-01-17 23:14:33
don_pista,"Hey, great to hear this is encouraging for you! No previous finance experience, I just have very basic understanding of accounting principles. But I have realised that the company was looking for entry level analysts (i.e. interns) with geology, mining or accounting background for this particular project, hopefully with the aim of keeping us after the project is done. So far the role has been pretty interesting - a bit of a steep learning curve, particularly with respect to creating the design/framework for the cost model, coming up with a systemic way of collecting data and implementing that data into the cost model. The data research component of the role has been alright so far as I've worked on a few technical reports before, so I know where to look for some of the information we need.

I was not expecting to land a role like this, but as stated on my original post, it all came down to improving my resume, sharpening my interview skills, and luckily, having some experience in the mining industry. Then again, the other intern who was hired for the project has a geology background, some geotechnical experience (not mining related), and some accounting experience, but they are struggling a bit with understanding some of the mining processes and terminologies.

It really sounds like you would be a great fit for the role that I got - how much experience do you have and what attracts you to become a Research Analyst in Mining and Metals instead of Consulting for example?",2021-01-18 00:21:13
outcomelessincome,"So a couple points to address:

1) I’m not saying the mattress industry is a scam, just that some specific mattresses by mattressfirm are overpriced based on their quality. I have absolutely no problem paying $600 or even $2000 for a mattress but I want the quality to reflect what I’m paying. I know for a fact the original $1.2K for this curve is a ripoff because the quality doesn’t compare to other mattresses in the same price range (nectar for example.

2) you say you sell mattresses at the price manufacturers tell you do, that is fair for brands like temperpedic.  But sleepy’s manufacturer is literally MattressFirm, so it seems MattressFirm just tries to squeeze customers for whatever they can with these mattresses. If they could tell a curve mattress for $1,200 they would,  but they know no one would pay that because there other staff in the shop at the same price that feels better. So they have a perpetual 50% off sale to make people think they’re getting a deal (as you said draw customers in). If they can sell it for $600 great but if not they have no problem going down in price, simply because the quality of the mattress is of those in the lower price range. Whereas temperpedic is a well known brand name they know the value of their mattresses and their prices are fairly consistent no matter where you are. High quality + a well recognized brand calls for a higher price, even if the margins are insanely high. 

4) I just think MattressFirm should be honest with it’s customers, instead of having a mattress listed at $1,200 and having a constant sale of 50% just list it at $600. That’s a much more fair price point based on the quality of the mattress and doesn’t involve the mind games of making customers think they’re getting a huge deal, whoever $600 is the fair price in the first place. Personally, I was going to cancel my order if I had to pay the $600 because I found other quality bed in the box mattresses in the same range. But at the $450 price I think what I’m getting for the price matches the quality so it’s worth it. It just annoys me some customers may think this mattress is worth $1,200. 

3) I live frugally in all aspects of my life, however I am willing to pay more money for more quality. I actually work in healthcare so I usually buy generic medicines vs the branded Tylenol or whatever because the quality is pretty much identical but generics are not marked up as much. I even have a whole YouTube channel talking about the importance of frugality and personal finance, not going to plug it here because I don’t need subs, but the point is that if something is not worth the value I am paying or if it is overpriced compared to competitors I will call it out no matter if it’s coffee, medicine, or a TV.",2021-01-18 01:43:10

keelaw,"Yes.  My reasons I suspect are a lot to do with my S10+ being an exynos model.

- Poor battery life
- So so low light photos
- Poor zoom
- Screen smaller than most flagships now
- Smaller hole punch
- 120hz
- Smaller curve on edge would reduce accidental touches 
- S pen will be fun
- Less lag in general performance
- So so fingerprint sensor 
- S10 only has one more year of software update 
- I want retail therapy after the rubbish 2020!


Other things I've considered:
- Defo sad to lose sd card but 256gb isnt that much extra and will  enough for me
- I don't use MST
- I'll use a case to reduce camera bump wobble and house s pen
- Cost is high but 0% finance over 2 yrs helps
- Very few competitors that I would consider
   - iPhone 12 pro max don't like iOS, big notch, sharp edges
   - oneplus camera not as good
   - xiaomi, oppo, vivo etc. I hear bad things about the UI and concerned about support outside of China 
   - Huawei, no Google

JayKanish,"You have two different options- paid and unpaid advertising. There are benefits and drawbacks to both:

&amp;#x200B;

**Paid**

&amp;#x200B;

Paid advertising means you are paying for ads, either through search engines or social media sites.

While you can scale really well with paid advertising, there's a learning curve and it can get expensive. You'd probably want to get help via a freelance site and hire a marketer to help since it can feel discouraging to spend a few hundred bucks and get nothing.

Additionally, you're charging $20 an hour so advertising costs can really eat into that. Which is why I would start with unpaid.

&amp;#x200B;

**Unpaid**

&amp;#x200B;

Unpaid is also known as organic. With this, you create a following by posting on social media (Reddit, TikTok, Facebook, etc).

Your main hurdle here is actually building your following. It takes time.

I'd recommend changing your FB account to start advertising. Join some groups in the niche (think personal finance rather than stock market groups, your target market aren't experienced traders.

Post a few times a week, provide actual value, and interact with the people you engaged with.

Also, be careful. You will run into a plethora of ""Organic Marketers"" that will sell you a course on how to create your market but everything they sell is easy enough to find on your own.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd recommend doing unpaid, make some cash selling hourly classes and then maybe scaling by making your own course.

If you have questions, DM me. This is all very basic and I could give you a little more detail so you can avoid the predatory ""entrepreneurs"" on social media.",2021-01-19 22:47:31
Lord_Pravus,"Aggressive investing, as in a taxable brokerage account? I wouldn't recommend that at your stage, assuming you want to strike an optimal balance between returns and financial stability. 

For me, personal finance is a priority system. Once you fulfill your top priority, you move down the list. My recommendation is as follows:

-$1-2k emergency fund to establish initial stability

-Contribute to 401k up to employer match

-Build emergency fund to 2-3 months expenses

-Pay off high interest debt (such as credit cards)

-Invest max contribution to an HSA (if available)

-Invest max contribution to an IRA

-Build emergency fund to 6 months expenses

-Pay off student loan debt

-Invest max contribution to 401k

-Either invest in a taxable account OR pay off low-interest debt (including mortgage)

This has worked well for me. Some of these can change in priority depending on how much you value stability. If you want the most possible returns as early as possible, you can increase investing priority... but speaking from experience, life throws curve balls and you'll wish you had some reserves available to weather the storm. 

Some people will debate whether it's worth aggressively paying off student loans. I think it is, partly from a morale perspective and partly to free up revenue, but depending on your interest rate, it might be mathematically better to invest instead. Same with a mortgage, actually. 

But I think I can safely say that investing through a taxable account this early is the wrong choice for the long term. It doesn't take full advantage of tax-free accounts, so you're immediately losing some return potential.",2021-01-19 23:30:05

benido2030,"To clarify my own thoughts (and later on act based on that...) I will write a post every month. I just want feedback on my thoughts, best case give you guys some food for thought as well and improve my crypto knowledge. I somehow picked the 20th of every month, cause ETH will go to... 10k :)

1. I / we all should get in touch with different defi projects even if you dont really use them. i have a business, but not a finance background. i have some stocks (apart from crypto obv) but I never shorted, leveraged, borrowed, lend etc. because why would I? and why would i borrow to then use this to put it somewhere else... you know the strategies. i have spend some money to use defi protocols and think this is a great investment, even if there was no financial gain. this last month I checked loopring and how it works. to understand layer 2 is crucial imo. 
2. a second project I thought about giving a try is curve (because I do have some stETH from trying liquid staking). curve is a great example why crypto UX still needs to improve to gain mainstream attention and later on usage. curve looks like 90s. compared to e.g. uni... OMG. and curve is rather successful. good thing is, I think they actually do wanna improve the page. best choice imo.  
3. we live in a crypto bubble. we are really early. always remember that. one example: there is always this argument that owning crypto (by e.g. taking it off exchanges) is so hard. whenever I hear this,  think thats bull. but this week I remembered how scared I was when I created my first wallet with metamask. I had no idea how all this works and only moved like 0.3 ETH to the wallet in case I fucked up. 
4. defi tokens will be the big winners of this cycle. alt coins from the previous cycle will have its time and gains, some new projects will also blow up, but I dont think those will perform as good as defi protocols. since ETH = defi right now I think that this will also be ETH cycle. but: i am not a ETH maxi. there will be more chains and other use cases that wont perfectly fit into ETH. 
5. i believe we wont see 5+ 30% crashes during this bull market. i made this prediction several times before and it seems to be right. there will be consolidation, but the market and its investors have matured. a ""huge"" crash will more likely be 20-25%. the first crash we saw fits this pattern. thus if you wanna sell to buy in at a lower stage (and I never did this nor will I do this in the future), just to wait too long. I also believe the bear market wont be a 80-90% correction this time. 
6. take profits. make a plan now and stick to it. I have a stack I plan to hodl, but have made a plan to exit a %. the first sell will be to recover my investment, the second sell is pure profits and ill use this stack to rebuy in case of a bear market. I still dont believe we will necessarily repeat the 4 year cycle and that selling in DEC 21 and rebuying automatically in summer 2023 will be a great decision. but if history rhymes, ill be there. if it doesnt, i took profits.

LongConvexity1,"1.  I just use glut as a term in reference to Bernanke.  The key point is you had these large growing pools of institutional cash looking for risk free/low risk assets.  I dont really care about terminology.

2.  I come at this from a finance background where we commonly use ""risk free"" to refer to certain asset classes and yields (like the UST yield curve).  Not gonna argue terminology as this is just what folks call it.  You're right about moral hazard, but even without the Greenspan put everyone will chase high risk adjusted returns.  I'm not sure what the argument is here.

3.  Lower than needed interest rates played a role but it wasn't a critical role.  One of many factors.  

4. Also the ""govt told them to lend to subprime borrowers"" story is weak.  Bank made CRA loans performed way better than comparable private lenders in those areas as banks are required to comply in a safe and sound manner (ie the govt doesn't want you taking on risk to comply with CRA).  Even so, the problem was that people didn't realize the risks they were taking, not that risks are bad.  There is a big market for subprime lending that does a lot of good for folks with marginal income.",2021-01-20 19:28:03

Developing a recovery plan for ASEAN Tourism and negotiations for a possible ASEAN-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA), as well as establishing the ASEAN Investment Facilitation Framework and the ASEAN Joint Declaration on Energy Transition and Energy Security are among the 10 Priority Economic Deliveries (PEDs) proposed by Brunei Darussalam for the ASEAN Economic Community.




All of the 10 PEDs under the three strategic thrusts of Recovery, Digitalisation and Sustainability were presented by Minister at the Prime Minister’s Office and Minister of Finance and Economy II Dato Seri Setia Dr Awang Haji Mohd Amin Liew bin Abdullah in his keynote address, during the ASEAN Business Advisory Council’s (ASEAN-BAC) 2021 Chairmanship Handover ceremony at the International Convention Centre yesterday.




Dato Seri Setia Dr Awang Haji Mohd Amin Liew said, “As ASEAN member countries gradually resume economic activities, the region’s economy has started to pick up, showing signs of our ability to adapt to this new environment. However, the pace of improvement has remained moderate. The spread of the COVID-19 virus has not yet subsided and many countries continue to be affected. A full-fledged recovery, in my opinion, seems much further down the road and will require continued unfaltering cooperation.”




He added, “It is imperative that we keep our sights on our ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) integration agenda. It is an opportunity for us to work together, to look into the immediate long-term goals of our efforts to revive the ASEAN Economy, from ensuring that our workforce and businesses are equipped with the necessary skills and tools to adapt to any economic disruption, while shaping ASEAN into becoming more resilient, dynamic and to be ahead of the curve in championing new solutions towards sustainability; hence ensuring a better future for the generations to come.”




The minister continued, “It is therefore fitting, that in 2021, for ASEAN to intensify efforts toward building an ASEAN Community that is inclusive, sustainable, resilient and dynamic.







“The pandemic has changed the dynamics of the world. It has definitely fast-forwarded ASEAN’s shift towards digitalisation. It goes without saying that digitalisation is and will remain to be a key component of economic growth in the 21st Century,” he said.




“Thus, it is crucial for ASEAN to safeguard the cybersecurity of the region by enhancing our capabilities, while also being cognizant of new and emerging technologies. Additionally, ASEAN must continue to demonstrate its resolute support and commitment for multilateralism.




“Under the theme ‘We Care, We Prepare, We Prosper’, Brunei Darussalam’s main focus is on three priority areas, namely caring for the people and each other’s wellbeing, preparing for future opportunities and challenges, and prospering together in a unified region.




“In this regard, Brunei Darussalam has proposed 10 Priority Economic Deliveries (PEDs) for the ASEAN Economic Community which are divided into three strategic thrusts, namely Recovery in progressing together towards the region’s economic recovery; Digitalisation in leveraging on new technologies and digitalisation for a resilient ASEAN; and Sustainability, which is in pursuit of advancing an inclusive and sustainable economic growth in ASEAN.




“On Recovery, which covers four of our PEDs, first is to conduct a comprehensive assessment to streamline Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs) in ASEAN member states. This includes the development of an NTM toolkit which can be used to review NTMs in terms of compliance, enforcement and design.




“Second is to develop a recovery plan for ASEAN Tourism, which is one of the most impacted sectors. This plan will help provide comprehensive and coordinated solutions to enhance sustainability, resilience and social inclusiveness in ASEAN Tourism industry during and post pandemic.




“Third, we aim to announce the launching of the negotiations for the possible ASEAN-Canada FTA. The foundation of this FTA has been laid out.




“Fourth is to develop the ASEAN Investment Facilitation Framework, which would facilitate investments into the region and prepare for the post COVID-19 new norm. Furthermore, it would help integrate ASEAN into global value chains and contribute to ASEAN’s comprehensive recovery effort.




“Under the second strategic thrust, Digitalisation, we have two PEDs, which are the fifth and the sixth. For the fifth PED, is to develop a work place to implement the ASEAN agreement on Electronic Commerce. This work plan will guide member states on how to advance the effective implementation of the ASEAN Agreement on E-Commerce over the next five years, both at regional and national levels.




“The sixth PED is developing a regional action plan in the area of cyberspace, as recommended by the 2015 United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (UNGGE) report. This will help the region in implementing the cyber norms and cooperation activities to develop the required capabilities.




“The third strategic thrust is sustainability, which consists of four PEDs, our seventh to 10th. The seventh PED is on developing an ASEAN framework which will support food, agriculture and forestry, small producers, cooperatives and MSMEs that have been severely impacted by the pandemic.




“The eighth PED focusses on energy, and that is to develop an ASEAN Joint Declaration on Energy Transition and Energy Security. This is expected to set out ways for ASEAN to cooperate in the pursuit of energy transitions and security.




“The next PED is looking at developing a framework for circular economy for the AEC. As a new concept, it is important to identify at this early stage the key areas of circular economy which are of relevance to the work of the AEC, drawing upon global and regional best practices,” he said.




“The last PED is on delivering key recommendations to advance ASEAN cooperation in mineral resource development in light of opportunities arising from global trends and shifts in the global minerals and metals markets. This PED will contribute to the sustainable community development goals of the AEC Blueprint 2025.




“There are three phases of a crisis: Emergency, Regression and Recovery. I believe, we are already entering the Recovery phase. Therefore, continuous sharing of real-time information, lessons learnt and experiences are an essential part of our pathway to recovery.




“It is important for us to keep in mind that economic recovery is evident by the resumption of business operations, recovery of employment levels as our people go back to work, and the easing of border movements, but true economic recovery is only fully realised when we demonstrate the ability to adapt to the new environment and possess a preparedness to combat similar crises and in pursuit of long-term sustainable growth,” the minister said.




“As the end users of ASEAN economic agreements and initiatives, we recognise that the private sector is a vital component of our economic integration agenda. Your expertise in relevant fields is invaluable in our post recovery efforts and the achievement of our deliverables, past, present and future.




“Digital technologies have played a crucial role during the pandemic, hence, the acceleration of digitalisation is key in our efforts to adapt in a post COVID-19 world,” the minister said.




“This is a chance for ASEAN countries to transition to a smart economy adapting to new ways of doing business, especially for our MSMEs to grow. It is therefore imperative for the public-private partnership be elevated to greater heights, to work hand-in-hand to ensure our short to long-term recovery goals are achieved; and thus for the region to strive, and be more sustainable and resilient in an inclusive manner.”

sneakpeek_bot,"&gt; # Commentary: GST hike unavoidable, will probably take place in 2023

&gt; A GST hike has been on the cards for some time. We should also expect further tax increases, possibly stamp duty increases, after the pandemic blows over, says Simon Poh.

&gt; SINGAPORE: We know tax increases are on the cards in Singapore. The Government had earlier announced the GST hike in Parliament in 2018, to be implemented sometime in this term of government.

&gt; 

&gt; The question is when it will happen. But after a year wrought by a deadly pandemic that saw Singapore tap on billions in our reserves, this is more likely to happen in 2023, rather than 2024 or 2025.

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; The pandemic has devastated our economies and the livelihoods of our people. Our national Budget has not been spared either.

&gt; 

&gt; There are some exceptions but with a collapsed world economy, tourism and domestic demand, many companies will see lower profit margins, leading to shortfalls in projected taxes and other forms of government revenues.

&gt; While Singapore’s GDP is expected to grow by 4 to 6 per cent this year according to the Trade and Industry Ministry, firms and households expect support from the Government given the poor outlook.

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; The timing of the GST hike will very much depend on the pandemic situation, which is still very fluid.

&gt; 

&gt; Global vaccinations are progressing slower than expected, as advanced countries grapple with the need to ramp up healthcare delivery systems.

&gt; 

&gt; Worse, we are still witnessing record infections in many countries including Malaysia, Japan and the US, where fresh curbs have been slapped on.

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Far from flattening the curve, the seven-day average of new daily global cases have been up an uptrend, reaching new highs this month of almost 800,000.

&gt; 

&gt; There are also remaining uncertainties including whether the COVID-19 vaccines prevent transmission, how long immunity lasts and how long more international borders will stay shut if new waves of infections continue.

&gt; 

&gt; SINGAPORE’S RECOVERY UNDER PRESSURE

&gt; 

&gt; Although Singapore has shifted into Phase 3, as a small and open economy reliant on global connections, the pace of our recovery will depend on how much other countries can bring down infection numbers, and whether international borders can gradually reopen.

&gt; 

&gt; So long as lockdowns are still prevalent, our aviation and tourism industries will remain in the doldrums. Singapore’s rebound will be muted if we rely mainly on propping up the domestic economy to tread water.

&gt; A man rests on a bench at the Elizabeth Walk park in Singapore on Oct 21, 2020. (Photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman)

&gt; The gradual recovery of our economy should take place towards the second half of the year. The irony is that Singapore’s COVID-19 numbers may increase with more imported cases when that happens but should not be a cause for immediate alarm.

&gt; 

&gt; HOW DETAILS OF THE GST HIKE MAY BE ANNOUNCED

&gt; 

&gt; Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat dedicated substantial time in February 2020 to explain why Singapore cannot defer the GST hike. He emphasised the need to fund broad–based increases in recurrent health spending, signalling that a responsible government should have “the discipline to raise revenue in a timely manner”.

&gt; 

&gt; I expect him to continue this prudent stance but take a calibrated approach to defer the GST hike until 2023, since the COVID-19 situation is unlikely to improve drastically by Budget Day on Feb 16.

&gt; 

&gt; But he may take a leaf from his earlier book to announce then the implementation date of the 2 per cent hike in 2023 to prepare the public for this hard decision.

&gt; ­Delaying the hike further until 2024 or 2025 will seriously weaken Singapore’s fiscal position. The Government is expected to chalk up a record deficit of about S$50 billion or more in the 2020 fiscal year - the first year of a new term of government - substantially funded from drawing down past reserves.

&gt; 

&gt; Both corporate, individual income taxes and GST, are expected to dip in the near term, so long as these tax rates remain unchanged.

&gt; 

&gt; Meanwhile, recurring expenditures, especially healthcare spending, are expected to surge. Healthcare has already risen by 11 per cent annually from 2012 to 2017. This increase itself is expected to exceed the projected additional revenue from a 2 per cent GST hike and it would not be right to use past reserves to fund recurring expenditure.

&gt; 

&gt; A 2 percentage point GST hike will raise additional government revenue of about 0.7 per cent of GDP per year, DPM Heng had pointed out in 2018.

&gt; 

&gt; A phased increase is more palatable to consumers but creates additional compliance hassle for firms already grappling with the challenges wrought by COVID-19 who must make the adjustments twice.

&gt; People queue to pay for groceries at a supermarket in Singapore on Apr 3, 2020. (Photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman)

&gt; Here again, the chances are that the Government may a leaf from the last GST hike in 2007 to bite the bullet and go for the full 2 percentage point hike. This will provide greater certainty for businesses.

&gt; 

&gt; OTHER TAXES COULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED

&gt; 

&gt; The Singapore Government could take a calibrated approach and consider imposing other tax increases.

&gt; 

&gt; However, in the context of a global economic downturn, the Singapore Government is unlikely to hike corporate income taxes or personal income taxes, given the dampening effects on businesses still struggling to find growth and on Singapore’s overall international competitiveness in attracting foreign direct investments and ability to support jobs.

&gt; 

&gt; Within the Asia-Pacific region, Singapore and Hong Kong lead the pack in having the lowest headline corporate tax rates of 17 per cent and 16.5 per cent respectively.

&gt; 

&gt; These rates have been maintained for more than a decade while neighbouring Asia-Pacific countries have been gradually lowering their corporate tax rates over these years to narrow the gaps.

&gt; 

&gt; Indonesia dropped theirs from 25 per cent to 22 per cent for 2021 and to 20 per cent in 2022 just last year – a rate on par with Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia’s.

&gt; 

&gt; To take a drastic approach to hike our corporate tax rate and reverse the trend of our gradual decline in rates over the past 40 years will not be wise in this environment, nor are there many historical precedents.

&gt; 

&gt; There is one bright spot that might help with boosting government coffers. Among all the bad news, the property market has proven to be surprisingly resilient, suggesting the market has huge liquidity.

&gt; 

&gt; The cooling measures over 2013, 2018 and more recent changes might have tempered speculation, putting the market on stronger footing. This strong performance by the property market suggests this sector may provide a strong tax base should the Government decide to raise wealth taxes rather than income tax.

&gt; Singapore's local property market is ""starting to see renewed positive sentiments and some gathering of momentum in prices"", DPM Heng had said on Monday, sparking speculation of more cooling measures.

&gt; ""We do not want to see the property market run ahead of the underlying economic fundamentals,"" he added.

&gt; There is scope to tax the property market to these ends. Most foreigners tend to buy homes in excess of S$1 million in the Core Central Region.

&gt; A view of private residential homes and executive condominiums in Singapore. (File photo: Reuters)

&gt; One way to do this is to further enhance the progressivity of the stamp duty regime by tweaking the stamp duty rates for larger houses.

&gt; 

&gt; Although the buyer’s stamp duty was raised for residential properties in excess of S$1 million in value in 2018, the Government could add a further increase to residences in excess of S$2 million in value. This measure should not affect Singaporeans in the lower- and middle-income groups.

&gt; 

&gt; Some people have argued to bring back estate duties, removed after 2008.

&gt; 

&gt; For deaths prior to this date, estate tax was payable on the principal value of property passed onto beneficiaries, subject to exemptions of S$9 million for residential properties and S$600,000 for non-residential assets.

&gt; 

&gt; If the Government does so, it would be for tax progressiveness rather than fiscal need, given the small amount of taxes collected, the small number of taxpayer base and the fact that it is easy for the ultra-rich to significantly reduce this tax through tax planning.

&gt; 

&gt; Nobody likes taxes, not even Ministers for Finance, as DPM Heng put it.

&gt; But of all the options available, GST, the fourth largest contributor to government revenue after Net Investment Returns Contribution, corporate and personal income taxes, remains the best one.

This sub while sometimes insanely relatable, is basically the biggest downer on reddit. Most people who post here are miserable in their lives and most of the time it's no fault of their own. 

My advice to you is to unsubscribe from this sub and follow some personal finance subs. Really become knowledgeable in all things finance. Learn to invest, learn to budget, and learn to be frugal. 


Your priorities should be as follows:

1. Spend less than you make. 
2. Invest the difference.
3. Work on increasing your income, but keep your spending static.
4. Never buy anything you can't afford.


Many will dismiss this as hustle culture, but thats not what I'm pushing at all. Work life is really shitty 95% of the time, but sitting here in despair won't do anything for you. If you're going to be subjected to this hell either way you might as well make the best of it. 

At the very least if you follow the above steps you'll minimize the likelihood that your situation becomes the bleakest of the bleak. Best case scenario you retire 5, 10, 15, even 40 years earlier then you normally would. Maybe you won't retire early, but you'll become financially stable enough to work 30 hours a week instead of 40. Maybe everything else goes to shit, but your preparation early in life prevents you from being homeless.

Either way financially preparing yourself and being mindful of your finances has no downsides. It will always benefit you in some way. 

You can still hate your job, society, and the way things are, but becoming complacent and not planning is only harming yourself.

You're letting them win when you give up and subject yourself to a life of wage slavery and misery. Top level capitalists and society want you to give up and neglect your finances. It keeps you a slave. They can't exploit somebody who's financially independent. 

The worst part is what I've described isn't even hard. There may be a slight learning curve, but once you're going it takes like 15 minutes a week.",2021-01-23 02:48:17

joenorwood77,"Curve DAO Token price today is $2.08 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $476,876,774 USD. Curve DAO Token is up 20.69% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #68, with a market cap of $408,554,249 USD. It has a circulating supply of 196,426,517 CRV coins and a max. supply of 3,303,030,299 CRV coins.

The top exchanges for trading in Curve DAO Token are currently Binance, Huobi Global, BitZ, OKEx, and HBTC. 


What Is Curve (CRV)?

Curve is a decentralized exchange for stablecoins that uses an automated market maker (AMM) to manage liquidity.

Launched in January 2020, Curve is now synonymous with the decentralized finance (DeFi) phenomenon, and has seen significant growth in the second half of 2020.

In August, Curve launched a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), with CRV as its in-house token. The DAO uses Ethereum-based creation tool Aragon to connect multiple smart contracts used for users’ deposited liquidity. Issues such as governance, however, differ from Aragon in their weighting and other respects.


Who Are the Founders of Curve?

The founder and CEO of Curve is Michael Egorov, a Russian scientist who has various experience with cryptocurrency-related enterprises.

In 2015, he co-founded and became CTO of NuCypher, a cryptocurrency business building privacy-preserving infrastructure and protocols.

Egorov is also the founder of decentralized bank and loans network LoanCoin.

Curve’s regular team is part of the CRV allocation structure, and will receive tokens according to a two-year vesting schedule as part of the initial launch plan.

In August 2020, Egorov said that he “overreacted” by locking up a large amount of CRV tokens as a response to yearn.finance’s voting power, awarding himself 71% of governance in the process.


What Makes Curve Unique?

Curve has gained considerable attention by following its remit as an AMM specifically for stablecoin trading.

The launch of the DAO and CRV token brought in further profitability, given CRV’s use for governance, as it is awarded to users based on liquidity commitment and length of ownership.

The explosion in DeFi trading has ensured Curve’s longevity, with AMMs turning over huge amounts of liquidity and associated user profits.

As such, Curve caters to anyone involved in DeFi activities such as yield farming and liquidity mining, as well as those looking to maximize returns without risk by holding notionally non-volatile stablecoins.

The platform makes money by charging a modest fee which is paid to liquidity providers.


How Many Curve (CRV) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Curve (CRV) launched in August 2020, along with the Curve DAO. Its purpose is to function as a governance medium, incentive structure and fee payment method, along with long-term earnings method for liquidity providers.

The total CRV supply is 3.03 billion tokens, the majority of which (62%) are distributed to liquidity providers. The remainder is divided as follows: 30% to shareholders, 3% to employees and 5% to a community reserve. The shareholder and employee allocations come with a two-year vesting schedule.

CRV had no premine, and the gradual unlocking of tokens means that around 750 million should be in circulation one year after launch.


How Is the Curve Network Secured?

Curve carries the standard risks associated with depositing funds in smart contracts and dealing with AMMs, namely impermanent loss.

As Curve only supports stablecoins, the risk of markets moving too quickly is reduced, but users can still lose money once markets are rebalanced to reflect cross-market prices.

Curve has been audited, but this does not do anything to counter the risks involved in being exposed to a specific cryptocurrency.


Where Can You Buy Curve (CRV)?

CRV is a freely-tradable token and is available against cryptocurrency, stablecoin and fiat currency pairs on major exchanges.

These include Binance, OKEx and Huobi Global, which hold the lion’s share of trading volume as of September 2020.",2021-01-23 10:44:37
OOWMPP,"**This was written on 2021 January 23** Hello. I developed a very comprehensive math model to predict the movement of a stock's prices based on the number of options issued, the option's prices, and the option's the strike price. We all know that if there are more puts for a stock than there are calls for the same stock, the investor's sentiments are bearish for that stock. 

We also know if there is a price premium for a put then there is for a call, that once again, the investors are bearish. 

So I developed a math model that factors these two things to determine the price of the stock if one person owned all the calls and puts of a given stock, and what the price of the stock should be such that this ""universal buyer"" has a maximum profit. 


**THIS MESSAGE WAS WRITTEN ON JANUARY 2018.**

Howdy folks, 

First of all, I apologize about the poor formatting here. If anyone wants my spreadsheets which comes with the equations and algorithms in the proper cell, I'll be happy to share it with you, but only if you're an academic or institutional investor. I'd love to get your insights and thoughts about this offline if you're an academic or an institutional investor.  

I a developing a math model for stocks based on the entire universe of calls and puts which expire on January 2018. My assumptions in developing this model, which I call the Omniscient Option Writer’s Model (OOWM), are the following:
1.	The options writers are the smartest investors. They’re like a Supercomputing Godhead.  
2.	If a person were to buy the entire calls/puts for a stock whose expiration date is on January 19th, 2018, there is a range of stock prices that this Universal Options Investor (UOI) would profit. Note, that the motives of the OOW and the UOI are opposing. 
3.	There is a stock price where the UOI would make the least money, and this coincides with the OOW making their greatest profit. This stock price which maximizes the OOW is, imaginatively, called the OOW’s Max Profit Price, OOWMPP.
4.	Conversely, there is a stock price that the UOI would make the most money, and this coincides with the OOW losing the most money.
5.	I’m assuming that the future movement of the stock is based on the OOW Stock Price. So another words, today’s stock price will converge to the OOWMPP on Friday, January 19th, 2018.

To determine the OOWMPP, I must net the entire universe of calls and puts which expire next January 19th. From experience, this requires an iterative algorithm. But just to give you an idea of how I determine the OOWMPP for a stock like AAPL, we will look at the entire options for AAPL. These strike prices for the calls/options are all found here: https://www.google.com/finance/option_chain?q=NASDAQ%3AAAPL&amp;ei=FgDXWPHFIoaa2AbhtY_gAQ
 
I do this for the entire calls and puts. I graph the total gains/losses VS the stock price for the OOW. For AAPL with a stock price on $139.04. I have it available if you are interested. 

If you graph this, you’ll see that this curve has an apogee (a maximum), and that it intersects the X-axis twice. The points where it intersects the X-axis represents the stock prices where the OOW breaks even. 

The two stock prices where the OOW breaks even are exactly: 
First $0 Gains stock price  - $67.73
Second $0 Gains stock price - $148.32

So another words, the OOW would only make money if the AAPL were priced between $67.73 - $148.32. 

In order to determine the MAXIMUM profit and the OOWMPP at which the maximum profit occurs, we see based on these data points that the OOWMPP occurs at around $110. When I “zoom in” on this model and test prices from $100-$120 using a $1 increment instead of a $10 increment, I see, once again, that the OOWMPP is at $110. As a matter of fact, when I superfine tune this and use a $0.01 resolution, I see that the OOWMPP is EXACTLY $110. 

First $0 Gains stock price  - $67.73
Second $0 Gains stock price - $148.32
OOWMPP - $110.00

ineednoBELL,"Not sure if you have CS related background, but i was a poly grad with finance diploma in CS now. Personally found that the intro mod CS1101S, has a very steep learning curve for beginners. Uni math is on a different level. Even if the math is doable for you, the bell curve is very steep and its very hard to score. I found CS2030 fun but i didnt score well. CS3230 is my most hated and my worst scoring module. It feels like my effort studying for that module is useless. 

As for headstart, i think you could start learning about discrete math to ease you into learning algorithms, and helps in you in programming.

BobSanchez47,"Good job maxing your Roth and having an emergency fund! You’re doing well! Pat yourself on the back.

Yes, you’ve slightly set yourself back by not adding to your Roth earlier. But don’t sweat it. A significant percentage of 29-year-olds have nothing invested at all. You’re still ahead of the curve. And you can still retire with a lot of tax-free and tax-deferred money if you play your cards right from now on, especially once you’re a fully fledged doctor.

With that said, here’s my “personal finance” advice. Keep maxing your Roth. If you have money to spare, consider putting it in your employer’s plan. You’ll be able to roll the 401(k) over into a traditional or Roth IRA when you part ways with that employer (which should be within a few years, since you’ll no longer be a resident). It’s possible you’ll be able to roll it over now if your plan permits “in service” rollovers.

Now, here’s my “investing” advice. You indicate that you’re interested in stocks and actively managed ETFs that have done well in 2020. The problem is that you’re “chasing returns”. This is not a good strategy. I recommend doing some research to see the data which indicates chasing yesterday’s hot stock is not a good strategy.

I strongly recommend sticking with Vanguard’s index funds for all your investing. Buying and selling individual stocks is risky and tax inefficient. Buying actively managed funds like ARKF is also tax inefficient and will result in you losing money every year to high fees. 

Definitely do not sell your VFIAX/VOO in your taxable account to buy another investment. You’ll be paying capital gains taxes, which will make the move even worse.

If you do want to slightly improve your investment strategy, I recommend the following. First, direct the majority of your incoming money to VTSAX (or VTI if you do ETFs) rather than VFIAX/VOO. The total stock market fund is more diversified, so you should see benefits over time. Second, consider directing some money into VTIAX/VXUS (Vanguard’s total non-US index fund). This offers significant diversification at the cost of slightly higher fees and taxes.

Good luck! Let me know if you have questions.",2021-01-24 08:49:01
urban_squid,"**Doug Ford’s hypocrisy in firing lockdown critic Roman Baber from the Conservatives is stunning
Baber was validly criticizing the increasingly draconian measures and their unintended side effects**

By Marty Gobin
OPINION 22 Jan 2021

Politicians who want to appear concerned but don’t comply with the pandemic guidelines they espouse, like staying away from other humans unless necessary, are ubiquitous these days.

The pseudo-religious pageantry usually involves a press conference with COVID conscious elected officials and bureaucrats. They stand in a V-formation, hands solemnly clasped in front of them, wearing masks (until they decide to speak), and distanced just enough that observers can tell they’re keeping their distance from other humans, but not quite so far as to be out of the camera’s field of view. After all, how would we know that they’re following their own advice to stay away from other people if they’re standing too far away to be seen? If they could catch or transmit the Ebola virus by being in the same room as others they wouldn’t dream of it, but this is different: The public needs to see how seriously our politicians take COVID-19, even if that means not taking it seriously.

One such display by the prophets of the COVID cult happened in Toronto on January 12. In a live briefing, Premier Doug Ford, the minister of health, and the attorney general got together in the same room as a couple medical yes men to announce a province-wide house arrest for the foreseeable future. The order-in-council they announced would last 14 days, but that’s only because that’s the longest period permitted by statute before needing to extend it (thus the lie in March 2020 that Ontarians’ civil liberties would be suspended for “two weeks to flatten the curve""). Disobeying the order is punishable by up to one year of imprisonment, a fine of $100,000, or both.

During the briefing, Ford instructed viewers to work from home where possible, despite having assembled with colleagues for a press event that could have been conducted remotely by Zoom, Skype, or a rotary phone. But the cabinet was seen to be concerned about following public health advice, and that’s what really mattered.

A few days later, Roman Baber, member of Provincial Parliament for York Centre, published a letter criticizing the increasingly draconian lockdowns and their unintended side effects. Whether Baber’s thesis about the utility of lockdowns is correct, he raised an issue that has so far been ignored by the Ford government: That anyone who has taken economics 101 knows that lockdowns will involve trade-offs, and the trade-offs should be considered in analyzing the utility of lockdowns.

For all the ever-changing “modelling” of projected COVID-19 deaths if lockdowns are not imposed, Ontario’s cabinet has not released any models of what lives the lockdowns have cost in terms of untreated medical issues, suicides, and overdoses. The lockdowns have also unquestionably damaged the economy, which, it’s worth remembering, funds the health care system that is needed to save lives. But these issues are not in vogue like COVID-19 deaths, so the cabinet has no desire to subject them to “modelling,” especially if it suggests that the cabinet is increasing the province’s body count.

Baber could be incorrect about his concerns (we don't know because the provincial government refuses to have an adult discussion about it), but can’t be dismissed as an anti-vaxxer, anti-masker, or uninformed kook. He lived under, and escaped, the Soviet Union in the 1980s while Ford was still living a carefree life as an alleged hash dealer. In the 2000s, Baber worked and studied hard to become a lawyer while Ford was inheriting a family business that someone else built. While Ford was struggling with a teleprompter at press briefings in between repeated violations of the sub judice convention, discussing what the sentences ought to be for presumptively innocent individuals charged with breaching his orders who had yet to even have had their first appearance, let alone a trial, Baber was the chair of the standing committee on justice policy committee at Queen’s Park, overseeing the provincial ministries tasked with upholding the rule of law in Ontario.

In short, if someone had to consult with an individual capable of discussing constitutional law, one’s duties as a member of the provincial legislature, the salutary and deleterious effects of legislation that might ultimately be the subject of discussion in an Oakes analysis when Ford’s OICs are inevitably subjected (successfully or not) to Charter challenges, how to scrutinize expert witnesses’ medical opinions, and what it is like to actually live in a society where central planners and technocrats determine what is “essential” through the force of law, the person to talk to would be Baber and not Ford.

So, as one might expect from the mind of someone whose best argument against political dissidents is to repeatedly call them “yahoos,” Ford immediately booted Baber out of the Progressive Conservative party, an almost certain death blow to any chances of Baber's re-election.

That was the penalty for simply questioning the wisdom of the cabinet. Yet when former Finance Minister Rod Phillips actually disregarded the province’s public health advice by vacationing abroad and Ford denied knowledge of it until admitting he was aware after being accused of incompetence if he actually didn’t know where his finance minister was for weeks, neither left the PC caucus. Phillips was permitted to leave the cabinet but still remained in the caucus as an MPP adding to his pension, and Ford imposed no penalties on himself after demonstrating a total lack of moral courage by throwing his friend under the bus for conduct he condoned until caught.

The takeaway is that, as with all its unnecessarily in-person choreographed press briefings, disregarding the party’s public health pronouncements is tolerated as long as an MPP is seen to agree with them. But if, rather than being a hypocrite, a member shows any sign of integrity by engaging in heresy and voices opposition to the party, going so far as to suggest that the party might be killing people, they have no business working with Doug Ford.",2021-01-24 11:16:57
ToBeAndNot," To directly answer your question, putting it all in a target date fund is fine. I tend to prefer recommending having your absolute basic cost of living funded by an SPIA and everything else in equities (VTWAX is fine), but a target date fund is usually fine.

I also just wrote this somewhere else, and it seems to apply here.

&gt; Is a tilt towards dividend ETFs and fixed income a bad idea?

As far as dividends are concerned, it's not a bad idea, but it's also not a good idea. It's a neutral idea. There's no evidence to prefer dividends over capital gains, and there's no evidence that dividends somehow do better than capital gains during a bear market. There's also no evidence for the converse. All you're really doing is concentrating your portfolio. Modigliani and Miller famously demonstrated that from a business capital structure, dividends vs capital reinvestment vs share buybacks provide the exact same value to investors.

Bonds tend to be somewhere between uncorrelated and slightly negatively correlated to stocks. If stocks are in a bear market, there's no real reason to believe that bonds will also be doing poorly. bonds can also happen to also do poorly during a bear market, but central banks have some influence over how bonds are doing and they try not to enact policy (such as raising the base yield curve) that leads to bonds doing poorly at the same time stocks are doing poorly.

All this being said, there's only one retirement income source that is guaranteed to not do poorly during a bear market: contractual income through something like a pension or annuity. The short story is that most retirement income experts will say that you should have your rice and beans money covered by a contractionual income source, and everything else in equities. For a full explanation of this, Wade Pfau's ""Safety First Retirement Planning"" is an incredibly well written book that covers planning for different kinds of retirement income expenditures.

For a quick explanation as to why annuities makes sense contrary to the typical story, here's an old comment of mine: 

&gt;People say annuities are a scam because they've had a bad experience with someone selling them something they didn't need and conflated that with the product rather than the sales person or their own understanding of the product. It's always strange to me that every expect in retirement income except 1 (William Bengen) recommends covering your rice and beans money with an annuity, but almost nobody has one. Most of what I'm going to be saying comes from Wade Pfau's ""Safety First Retirement Planning"" and Moshe Milevsky's ""Pensionize Your Nest Egg"". If you're going to read one of those books, read Pfau's. Professor Milevsky writes more dense books that can be hard to read.

&gt;they specifically recommend a Single Premium Immediate Annuities (SPIA) or Single Premium Deferred Annuities (SPDA) and have it cover you and a partner. They specifically do not recommend getting additional features such as it being guaranteed or variable rates. The idea that they present is pretty simple. Instead of bonds, have enough money in an annuity to cover your rice and beans expenses and have everything else in equities. Milevsky has shown two things. First, you need less money in an annuity than you need bonds to provide the same amount of fixed income reliability. You need about 30%-50% more in bonds than you have in annuity to have the same income reliability. Due to having more of your money in equities, he has also shown that over an average lifetime, you typically leave more legacy and can take more advantage of good market conditions by increasing your discretionary spending if you use annuities for your retirement fixed income over bonds.

&gt;Why do annuities make sense? There's the concept of risk pooling that most people don't quite understand. Any arbitrary person might live until they're 95+, thus this person needs to plan to live until 95+. They need to plan to make sure their portfolio has longevity. This person financing their retirement with stocks and bonds needs to allocate bonds more heavily in their portfolio to make sure they have longevity. Now suppose we have 100 people. On average, these people will live an average lifetime not 95+, but any one of them may live until they're 95+. If they are each financing their own retirement, they each need to plan to live to 95+ and allocate their bonds accordingly. On the other hand, if they pooled their longevity risk together, they would only need to fund 100 average lifetimes rather than 100 95+ lifetimes. This is why single premium annuities are the cheapest way to finance a basic retirement income. You need to plan for a shorter lifetime if you pool risk rather than if you attempt to finance it yourself.

&gt;There is a concern people have about inflation. The recommended annuities don't adjust for inflation, but you don't need every individual asset in your portfolio to adjust for inflation, you just need your entire portfolio to generally grow with it. Also realized inflation is often different than Fed targeted inflation. If you own your residence or have a mortgage, you have protected yourself against one of the largest sources of inflation. Pfau recommends if you are noticing that your annuity isn't covering your core expenses, buy another.",2021-01-28 09:19:02

Leecifer19,"I don’t think it’s any one platform. There are multiple sectors. So by sector:

Lending: Aave. While they started as ETHLend and rebranded in 2018, Aave has pioneered overcollateralized loans and flash loans, while offering depositors a variable APY for passive income. While Maker has dominance right now, I think Aave is going to grow with DeFi and offer more products. I’m going to guess Aave is going to see their price increase beyond the price of COMP soon.

Aave keeps pioneering and expanding their reach in the Lending sector.

DEXs: This one is hard to say, but I think it’ll be hard to unseat Uniswap from the top spot. Once V3 is launched, UNI is going to blow up beyond what we can imagine.

Most tokens are listed on Uniswap before they are listed anywhere else. Because Uniswap has the highest TVL of all the DEXs, they usually have the least amount of slippage. So many projects offering yield farming for Uniswap LPs.

Uniswap needs to implement an L2 solution, but beyond that, Uniswap is going to be hard to beat.

Derivatives: Synthetix. No other platform in on-chain derivatives has the dominance and adoption that Synthetix has. I they have so many assets you can go short/long on either through inverse/synthetic assets or true options in the OptionsDAO. 

Synthetix just upgraded to Optimistic Ethereum (L2 solution), and the gas fees are going to slowly diminish as OE is fully integrated into the platform. Just about every VC investing in DeFi has thrown money at Synthetix. There is so much room for further innovation here.

The 2021 Roadmap is so promising, and while there is a lot there, the team behind Synthetix ships upgrades like no ones business. 

Plus: by using Curve, there is literally no slippage when converting sUSD to any synthetic asset. That is a rare thing.

Insurance: Nexus Mutual or Armor.Fi.  While Armor.fi underwrites coverage through Nexus Mutual, Armor Fi doesn’t require KYC like Nexus Mutual does. You can stake wNXM on Armor Fi and earn rewards without having to go through a KYC process like you do to interact with the Nexus Mutual app. You can buy coverage through Armor Fi, too, without KYC.

By and far, Nexus Mutual is the dominant smart contract cover provider on Ethereum. In fact, there isn’t another platform that offers coverage like Nexus does. Hopefully Nexus can expand offerings this year and grow their active community through their work with Amor Fi.

These are my opinions, and I do think their are other platforms that we’ll see grow incredibly fast this year—like Alpha Finance Labs.

We’ll see who captures more market share as the year goes on.",2021-01-28 14:28:39

bananainbeijing,"Apologies for the long story, but I wanted to get this off my chest.

I went to Stern and studied finance and accounting, graduated in 2008. While I was there, I met some of the people that would go on to be successful on Wall Street. Here are some of the stories.

I had a ""friend"" that I got along with super well. We went on a short weekend trip with the class, and she and I walked around the hotel til 2 in the morning talking about our future and just random crap college students talk about. I thought we were good friends, you know? We were in one of the same classes. I was sick and missed a class, and I asked to borrow her notes for that day. She refused. Basically was like sucks for you. The class was graded on a curve. The lower test score I got, the better for her, and her chances of landing a prestigious finance job. Wasn't friends with her after that.

I had another friend who's roommate turned off her alarm for an 8am class. She overslept and missed an exam because of this. Similar reasons, class was graded on a curve.

And I knew a guy that was the epitome of douchebag. Narcissist, self indulging (though quite attractive), but was a bit of an asshole. He was good friends and roommates with a buddy of mine. Every time we got study notes and prior year exams, we would share them with everyone. Not this dude. Multiple times, he would get exams from his gf, and never share at all. He ended up interning at a bank, and later went to a hedge fund. I'm sure he fit right now. I've always wanted to say this, but fuck you D***. I never knew why we put up with your shit. Yes you prob make more money than me, but at least I have my morals and real friends. 

These are the types of people I dealt with at Stern, most of whom went on to Wall Street. Of course there were a lot of cool people, but most of them just weren't cut out for the Street. Most of the reasonable people I knew left after 1 - 5 years. If you have a heart and soul, Wall Street isn't the place for you.

The last thing I want to say is, fuck those guys. They don't give a shit about you, and will do anything to make a buck. I'm glad I never ended up there.",2021-01-28 17:18:11

BlackLeader70,"Well basically if you have enough margin from other stocks to cover the loss of another stock then you won’t get margin called. If your overall account goes negative they might force you to sell to cover part of the losses then bill you the rest. 

Personally I sold some profitable stocks on RH as part of a plan to divest from those cunts. So even though I’m negative on “stock 1” I have enough margin to cover that from selling “stock 2” 

But at the end of the day, you gotta do you...stocks, cryptos and finance in general do have a pretty sharp learning curve. Keep educating yourself and build on it!",2021-01-29 07:22:45
samdane7777," 

There is a overall trend within the power sphere and oligarchy that constitutes western countries and central banks. What Dwight D Eisenhower referred to could better now be described as a Military- Tech -Finance Industrial Complex. What started off as partisan deplatform absolutely will become whole sale deplatforming of the lower classes, it will absolutely be a Patriot Act 2.0, and this will all absolutely affect cryptocurrency.

Before I get into this, I want to say, I tried for nearly two years to post things about regulatory threats in the main reddit for bitcoin. They don't care about the overall effect of regulations on the whole space, even when it is an existential threat. They are dominated by underinformed under educated american who are largely toxic maximalist. It's not just unhealthy to the community it is becoming an existential threat because we need to be organized. That's what the Wallstreets Bet fiasco should teach you. And r  /   bitcoin banned me for 30 days, more or less for telling the truth. I lost my temper because for months on end I got horribly unconstructive dismissal of these regulatory threats. And then low and behold The Treasury Department with Mnuchin came out and did the very thing I said it would with its attempt to force KYC on personal cold storage wallets receiving deposits from CEX.

Look they have to find a way to keep us from competing with them and their fiat, they have to find a way to shut us down when they cannot stop the protocol level. I believe that way will be through proof of source of income and using chain analysis to strand your DeFi and overseas money out of the united states, to block deposits that come from ecosystems outside the bank and us regulator controlled centralized platforms by blocking people who cannot provide a chain of custody/source of income records.

And that is just in addition to censoring and deplatforming countless exchanges and assets.

Just build your own social media.

Just build your own server infrastructure.

Just build your own bank.

Just build your own internet.

Just build your own broker.

***Well, we have to, unironically, we have to build the full infrastructure stack.***

We have to set everything up like the piratebay with infinte mirrors, no single attack vector, distributed dns, server hosting, distribute and censorship proof the entire stack. The Federal Agencies and Banks will come for it hard. They will say only terrorists use it. **They will remove everything hosted on github. They have the legal precedent to go after developers now with the federal ruling against Helix. That was intentional to lay the groundwork for future attacks on DeFi.**

If you host it on github, you're screwed, if you doxx yourself as a developer, screwed, if you doxx the liquidity provider, screwed.

Right now, Sushiswap,Uniswap, Curve, Kyber, Ren, Thorchain, Solana, are just some of the beginning full onchain protocol level defi systems, this is just the beginning of what it will take to make this system battle proof.",2021-01-29 12:25:15
that_blockhead,"The three most common that I know of:

1. Interest paid from supplying liquidity to lending protocols, just like earning interest by lending money in traditional finance
2. Trading fees earned from pooling liquidity on an AMM (decentralized exchange like Uniswap, Sushi, Balancer etc)
3. Native-token APY from one of the above or staking - protocols like Compound, Curve and others reward one of the activities mentioned above with additional APY paid in their native token, as a bonus incentive and/or way to reward participants for using the protocols in the early stages. This is where most of the very high APYs come from, with the drawback that the native protocol token is usually highly inflationary (at least for a period of time until distribution is complete). But it's a way to distribute the token at least somewhat fairly, as it goes directly to users and those providing a necessary service at the early stages, much like Bitcoin mining - in fact it's often called liquidity mining. This is one of the reasons why it's a great time to get into DeFi while it's still early - at some point most of those protocol tokens will be fully distributed and the early adopters of successful DeFi protocols will have had the opportunity to accumulate positions in the future of finance while earning yield on their funds!",2021-01-29 15:06:18
Nzwiebach,"If you’re mad at wall street banks and hedge funds for what they did at the battle of GME, buy silver to hit them in the heart. SLV is the most shorted asset in the world. The gold to silver ratio is 70:1 it’s fundamentally more undervalued than it has been in the history of its use. It’s more utilized today than it has ever been. It’s price is suppressed for finance, and industry management. You pump SLV you crash the whole hedge fund system. A fair value for silver would be around $200 for the supply and demand curve it exists on. it’s ~25.00. A short squeeze would send it to $1000. The market cap is 1.4 trillion, but it is paper traded 100x the available material in the futures market, so it is significantly less. They also CANT shut it down. SLV is a tracker fund of the price of real silver. If they stop trading you can drive to a coin shop and buy the real stuff.

The math. There’s 4.3 million WSB users.
There’s ~55 billion ounces of physical silver believed to be in the world. (BUT! Silver isn’t recycled so it’s likely much less. Account for industrial consumption and global dispersion, there’s little to no real available trading silver. Bullion sites run out all the time.)
If the average WSB user is like the lower wage investor their median investment portfolio is around $10,000 but the national median is 130,000 so there’s some disparity. 
If all WSB users bought silver or SLV at an average account value of $15,000 they wouldn’t be able to buy it all. They would consume &gt;5% of the entire perceived silver market. WSB would hold more silver than the United States and China combined.",2021-01-29 17:57:18

More_than_Salvation,"&gt;People have raised similar concerns about global collapse due to energy starvation.  The ""peak oil""/Hubbert Curve craze was the first wave. It predicted depletion of world oil production and global collapse, but that idea has died in the face of hydraulic fracturing (""fracking"") techniques that actually boosted potential oil production.

The oil producer have to get in debt and the production of unconventional oil is not profitable. It is more environmentally damaging and polluting. The EROI is lower compared to conventional oil. It is also finite: there is concern that the peak of unconventional oil will reach around 2025 to 2030.

Also it has been shown that economical growth is dependent on the energy consumption of fossil fuel, especially oil.

How would you finance renewable energy or even manufacture or transport the renewable technologies after the peak is reached?",2021-01-30 03:24:40
disruptthenorm,"So I think it depends on the kind of finance you want. PM or technical lead in fin tech is absolutely possible but I’d question need an MBA to be a tech lead (definitely need it for PM)

Truthfully have no clue what a Tech Lead in PE/VC is, but for those roles, particularly for PE you’re going to need pre-MBA IB or PE experience. The learning curve and risk is too high to take anyone without it. For buyside also the M7 you go to will play a huge role. HBS, Booth, CBS, and Wharton punch above their weight for PE while others have it but it’s more networking and less of the “sexy” funds.

FreeKhajiit,"Investopedia and Youtube are your friends, G. Specific channels that have helped me (and I still don't know jack shit really) are InTheMoney, Kamikaze Cash and trading Trading Fraternity. That's just me giving you the bare tip. Hehehe. 

As for brokers, screw Stash. I would say Robinhood six months ago but....holy fuck no. NO!!!!! I'd rather you stick with Stash. I'm dropping RH right after GME is over and I can cash out.

TD Ameritrade is pretty solid for info, stats and all that. The Think or Swim platform, while I'm still doing plenty of messing around with it, and has a steep learning curve, is pretty much top notch in its category from what I'm aware. You can even actually *call* TDA and have their reps sit down with you and give you tutorials on what goes where (hint pp goes *into* vajayjay, make sure you tell your customer service rep that).

Of course TDA is my more 'serious' broker (soon to be only), so I'm probably a bit biased. One drawback I just discovered is that it rejects limit orders above the current price by a certain spread (so if it's going for 350, you can't place a limit sell for 1,000). Usually not a huge problem but.....obviously you never know. So I'll probably start shopping around too. 

Plenty of other decent commission free options like Etrade and Webull (though I distrust any Chinese company tbh), Vanguard, Schwab and Fidelity. Though you may have to save to a certain amount before you can bat for. Feel free to shop around for what works best for you. Read reviews, ask around on the subreddits and shit. You know.

As for subs, fuck r/investing unless you think 3% annual returns are good. Which I mean....ok Boomer, whatever works for you. 

If that's the case, and I won't kink shame you for liking to watch turtles get freaky, you want to look at boring shit like ETFs, Mutual Funds, and other crap like that (basically buying into a bundle of stuff, whether a certain market, idea, or just *the market itself,* instead of one security). That sort of thing, as well as bonds and CDs and whatnot, are more about keeping your money with small and steady gains rather than making it hand over fist. For the latter you want to look at options or Forex (foreign exchange markets), both of which require some balls of 💎 but there are strategies for steady gains (in theory) and you can leverage a comparatively small amount of money to make a solid bit more. Or watch it all turn to a pile of shit in front of your very eyes. Just be careful with that because unlike buying stocks you *can* go below zero if you fuck up in certain ways (generally your broker will have to review your application to be this stupid and allow it), and that is not a spot you want to be. 

More specific stuff like r/options, r/stocks, r/daytrading, and my favorite homo homeboys over at r/thetagang (which has its own website that's pretty legit) can all be good if you're willing to sift through some garbage. 

As for this sub, my dude. This is legalized gambling. It started off as a bunch of yuppie finance dorks who all had an extra 70k laying around to do dumb shit with. Sometimes someone would strike the fuck out. Sometimes while literally having no clue how they did it. Sometimes there's actually genuine insight and a smart move or two. 90% of that probably isn't what you'll read. I'd hang around for the memes and loss porn, maybe try your hand at some of the fuckery they suggest, but take almost all of what you read here with a table shaker of salt.",2021-01-30 11:38:18

With most online music retailers you can finance a MPC Live for two years interest free and it’ll cost you less than a decent iPhone. :) The great thing about the MPC Live is that you get the MPC software DAW included so if you have certain things you’d rather do in a computer then you have the option. But as a MPC Live owner I can tell you that won’t be very often - the device is great. Learning curve is steep at first, but you can greatly flatten that by watching TubeDigga YouTube videos and buying the MPC Bible.

Then, the rest comes, and in the mean time, you inadvertently learn how to trade in the best possible way.

Yes, gas spikes due to network congestion, which means it is favored by many people. I am a very small player, but I can attest that it was only possibly through paying the cost of opportunity (gas) that I could profit on the midterm.

Btw, look into gas mechanics. It is always possible to pay around %30 less even after you sign the transaction. 

...and, learning the complicated details help you in the long term rather than using kinda centralized apps on ethereum. Plus, there is considerable amount of airdrops every now and then just because you make a transaction on a given platform.

RadiantCellar,"There is no way that Serbia or Venezuela or any of the other 2nd world shitholes you listed ever had the geopolitical power to get off the fiat system without some sort of under-handed sanctions bringing them to heel. This is why your examples are bogus under the surface. True fiat is the petrodollar. All the other currencies are subordinate in differing degrees. It is what allows the US to export its inflation, countries must pay for oil with dollars, driving the demand for dollars up.

Central banking is a global force with the US as its primary hegemon and enforcer, and there are globalist financial organizations that represent them, like the IMF. Intelligence agencies like the CIA, FBI, and M\*ssad assist them. If you cannot be convinced that powerful connected people will seek to preserve and expand their system of influence as a rule, there's simply no way we can have an intelligent discussion. See all the Middle East countries (ex. Iraq) that did not have a central bank before 2001 and now do. Or perhaps you think private central banks are an unmitigated improvement to a country?

I did not intend to be semantic; it really does not matter. Living memory is an arbitrary limitation you asked of me. We study history for a reason; there are reasons beyond your hyper-specialized understanding of finance and silver mine logistics. Civilizations follow trends, both in their rise and fall. The trends are all negative here. Speculating in silver is ultimately hedging against fiat collapse up to the total collapse of civilization and the start of another one.

Anyway, you got me all worked up by being a pretentious cunt to that guy who suggested the next crash might be more comprehensive and damaging just off of animal instinct, hence the bell curve midwit meme.  

Also, ""You have to reference outside of living memory for this statement to hold true, which means it isn't true or actionable."" This is a completely unfounded argument that you use to debunk my ENTIRE argument from the start. YOUR ARGUMENTS were all based on a false premise.

Here's me mimicking your rhetoric, (the unfounded and sophistic denigration (""word-salad"") of your counter-arguments would be in my next response, which isn't coming): You're an intellectually dishonest person with unresolved mental illness issues and a superiority complex and most likely a feeble body. You feel an urgent need to come on here and instead of teaching people the right way because you love your fellow man, you actively berate them for purchasing inflation and downturn resistant assets and call them ""peons,"" flexing your ultimately limited understanding of the world through the lens of high finance and your expertise in silver mining. Not to mention combining dishonest and hypocritical rhetoric. Many of the people here do not have a finance background and are just trying to secure their meager futures. It sounds like you're already secure, so stop shitting on everybody. It's frankly embarrassing that you're already high and mighty with what I assume is sub 8 figures.

KonekoBot,"[13 months here, my equity curve is an absolute roller coaster of emotion and sorrow, buts it's amazing! This industry is absolutely soul destroying, I'm not sure how finance guys who manage millions of other peoples' money can do it day in day out. Losing thousands and thousands myself (justified as tuition, happy to pay it) has been painful, but necessary. Every single well paying industry demands suffering to see success, doctors, lawyers, athletes.... They all suffer for their craft, and are only rewarded after perseverance and honest reflection on their shortcomings.  To be 100% honest, I'm also giving up (full-time) trading. It's absolutely ruined my work-life balance, I've grown up being a geek on the computer, and my leisure habits blend together with my work habits, it doesn't work very well. I've tried the full time thing, but I'll go back to my old job/career and focus on trading premarket/the open and lean on swing trading with wider stops. To touch on your last point, yea.....I thought I was so close @ 3 months, 6 months, and 10 months, and when you think you're close, the market will slap the fuck out of you, take your money, and laugh. It's 100% normal. Trading also doesn't require any special skills either, I believe LITERALLY anyone can do it with enough patience and grit.  I/we have no way of knowing, but if your biggest winner in 12 months is 0.30, you're trading the wrong stocks. Stock selection is just as important as planning, mental fortitude, research, and screen time. Again, not 100% sure, but I'd be willing to bet a large sum you're trading some penny stock garbage. Have you tried different types? Mega caps, indexes, small/mid caps, low floats... There's a lot of options and ways to trade, I think that's actually to the detriment of a lot of people at times. For examples, myself I've traded QS for 5 out of the last 7 trading days, LCID, NIO, SOFI, AFRM, all these have traded well, and I was never EVER looking for a 0.30 move. Perhaps adjust, paper trade (for fun) and think longer term. Some of the smarter furu's will say ""Trading is a get rich slow scheme"" and they couldn't be more correct.

[Hey, if I had held onto Upstart, I would have probably gotten a kick of euphoria and kept buying on high more and more until the inevitable pullback. I don't regret my reasoning for selling the stock though. I didn't know it then and I still don't know it all that well now, just went by some advice that it would be a high-flying stock. That obviously turned out to be true, but I'd rather buy the likes of CHPT and STEM and hold their bags until I get some long-term returns because I believe in both stocks.](/r/stocks/comments/pyfu9h/remember_what_investing_is_all_about/heuu0y6/)

[Here's the problem OP: most, if not all of your stocks are garbage.  Most people here are telling you just to hold, don't panic yada yada yada because they're invested in good companies that move slower but actually make money and are established, and will almost always recover after a price drop. They either don't know or don't care what it's like to buy crap companies and lose a shitton on them.   The stocks you own range from mid-cap to microcap which makes them much more risky as investments and you NEED to know what you're doing when you buy them. Don't just buy them and hope they go up unless you understand that you are gambling. Investing is KNOWING what you're buying and why you're buying it. You need a plan for when the stock goes up and goes down. Otherwise you end up in this situation where you're losing large amounts of money and asking random people on the internet for advice.  As for what to do now: decide what you can jettison and what you really believe in. You said you had faith in BLNK and CHPT - but can you explain why you believe in them? I personally only like CHPT out of everything you own, but I'm just one guy, and I haven't researched AQB, EVGO, UK and STAF. BLNK is not a great company but it's surprisingly resilient compared to some of the other stocks that melted up over the winter. You also need to consider larger factors weighing on the market itself - inflation and what it means for companies like yours. Generally, it's not expected that the average speculative growth stock will do well in a hot economy, but there are exceptions for truely exceptional companies.](/r/stocks/comments/pxyrnh/wtf_is_going_on_with_the_market/hequtk9/)

The share price can even be in the hundreds of dollars in the future if it's like the ""Apple"" of EV charging. You need to have confidence in it. The share price has dropped greatly and I know it hurts to watch but when it rebounds, I think it will be a 50%+ bounce.

Grayscale® Digital Large Cap Fund and Grayscale® DeFi Fund Announce Quarterly Rebalancing of Funds  
Smart contract platform Solana and decentralized exchange Uniswap have been added to the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund  
October 01, 2021 17:57 ET | Source: Grayscale Investments  
  
...  
New York, Oct. 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grayscale Investments®, the world’s largest digital currency asset manager, and manager of both Grayscale® Digital Large Cap Fund (OTCQX: GDLC) (the Digital Large Cap Fund) and Grayscale® DeFi Fund (the DeFi Fund), today announced the updated Fund Component weightings for each product in connection with their respective quarterly reviews.   
  
In accordance with the Digital Large Cap Fund’s construction criteria, Grayscale has adjusted the Digital Large Cap Fund’s portfolio by selling certain amounts of the existing Fund Components in proportion to their respective weightings and using the cash proceeds to purchase Solana (SOL) and Uniswap (UNI). This announcement follows the July 2021 news that Grayscale adjusted the Digital Large Cap Fund’s portfolio and purchased Cardano (ADA), and is the first time Solana (SOL) will be included in a Grayscale investment vehicle.   
  
Solana  
  
SOL is the native token of the Solana network, a smart contract platform first conceived by Anatoly Yakovenko in a 2017 whitepaper. Like the Ethereum network, the Solana network is one of a number of projects intended to expand blockchain use beyond just a peer-to-peer money system. The Solana protocol introduced the Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism as an alternative to pure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains like Ethereum. PoH is intended to provide a transaction processing speed and capacity advantage over traditional PoW and PoS networks, which rely on sequential production of blocks and can lead to delays caused by validator confirmations.   
  
Uniswap  
  
UNI is the native token of the Uniswap network, a decentralized exchange originally conceived in 2016 by Vitalek Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, and later developed in 2018 by Hayden Adams and Uniswap Labs. Uniswap enables trading of digital assets without a central order book by aggregating digital asset trading pairs using smart contracts. On Uniswap, users exchange digital assets with one another by paying a transaction fee to independent market makers called liquidity providers. Holders of UNI have the ability to propose and vote on improvement proposals to adjust features of the Uniswap network.   
  
At the end of the day on October 1, 2021, the Digital Large Cap Fund’s Fund Components were a basket of the following assets and weightings.  
  
Bitcoin (BTC), 62.19%  
Ethereum (ETH), 26.08%  
Cardano (ADA), 5.11%  
Solana (SOL), 3.24%  
Uniswap (UNI), 1.06%  
Chainlink (LINK), 0.82%  
Litecoin (LTC), 0.77%  
Bitcoin Cash (BCH), 0.73%  
No new tokens were added or removed from the DeFi Fund. At the end of the day on October 1, 2021, the DeFi Fund’s Fund Components were a basket of the following assets and weightings.  
  
Uniswap (UNI), 45.20%  
Aave (AAVE), 14.11%  
MakerDAO (MKR), 7.84%  
SushiSwap (SUSHI), 7.18%  
Compound (COMP), 6.73%  
Synthetix (SNX), 6.29%  
Yearn Finance (YFI), 3.92%  
Curve (CRV), 3.53%  
Bancor Network Token (BNT), 3.04%  
UMA Protocol (UMA), 2.16%  
Neither the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund nor the Grayscale DeFi Fund generate any income, and both regularly distribute Fund Components to pay for ongoing expenses. Therefore, the amount of Fund Components represented by shares of each fund gradually decreases over time.

About Grayscale® Digital Large Cap Fund  
Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund enables investors to gain exposure to a market-cap weighted portfolio of large-cap digital currencies through a singular investment vehicle without the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping digital currencies directly. Through a rules-based portfolio construction methodology derived from the CoinDesk Large Cap Index, the Digital Large Cap Fund targets coverage of the upper 70% of the digital currency market and is re-evaluated each quarter; however, the weightings of each Fund Component change daily and are published around 4:00 p.m. NY-time.\*  Additional information on the Index methodology can be found at: https://tradeblock.com/markets/dlcx.  
  
The Digital Large Cap Fund's investment objective is for its Shares to reflect the value of Fund Components held by the Digital Large Cap Fund, less its expenses and other liabilities. To date, the Digital Large Cap Fund has not met its investment objective and the Shares quoted on OTCQX have not reflected the value of Fund Components held by the Digital Large Cap Fund, less the Digital Large Cap Fund's expenses and other liabilities, but instead have traded at both premiums and discounts to such value, with variations that have at time been substantial.  
  
The Digital Large Cap Fund is an investment vehicle with Shares titled in the investor’s name, providing a familiar structure for financial and tax advisors and easy transferability to beneficiaries under estate laws. Additionally, Shares are eligible to be held in certain IRA, Roth IRA, and other brokerage and investor accounts.  
  
About Grayscale® DeFi Fund  
Grayscale Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Fund holds digital assets that make up the CoinDesk DeFi Index. These digital assets are drawn from the universe of investable digital assets native to decentralized finance or DeFi. The Index methodology includes liquid DeFi assets on a market cap-weighted basis and is re-evaluated each quarter; however, the weightings of each Fund Component change daily and are published around 4:00 p.m. NY-time.\* Additional information on the Index methodology can be found at https://tradeblock.com/markets/dfx/.  
  
Grayscale intends to attempt to have shares of this new product quoted on a secondary market. However, there is no guarantee this will be successful. Although the shares of certain products have been approved for trading on a secondary market, investors in this new product should not assume that the shares will ever obtain such an approval due to a variety of factors, including questions regulators such as the SEC, FINRA or other regulatory bodies may have regarding the product. As a result, shareholders of this product should be prepared to bear the risk of investment in the shares indefinitely.  
  
 \*The compositions of the Digital Large Cap Fund and the DeFi Fund are evaluated on a quarterly basis to remove existing Fund Components or to include new Fund Components in their portfolios, in accordance with the Construction Criteria established by Grayscale or the Index Provider, as applicable.

chairfairy,"I'm not suggesting every Excel user should use version control, but that it's worth considering if you find yourself struggling through clumsy ways to track new file revisions. It's a big enough learning curve that most of us don't want to jump into VCS unless there's good reason, but once you get over the initial hump it can be really trivial to use, especially if you're not working with a large team editing all the same files at the same time. (And even with VCS it's often critical to coordinate with your teammates who works on each set of files at any given time - it's not a magic wand.)

Where Excel fits in the your organization depends a whole lot on the organization. It's not only finance / business folks using it - engineering and manufacturing also rely on it heavily. We're often flying be the seat of our pants with data, using Excel to prove out the math for a new process or check results when we don't have a real system to run the test. It's very much *not* taking in clean, well defined data.

VCS does bring a lot to the table when you have a multi-developer team, but it's a bit of a narrow view to say it applies only to that scope. My whole team of programmers is 3 people and we mostly work on projects individually, but our git repository is indispensable. On top of rev tracking, it lets us share a common code base and be able to keep each of our copies of a given file in sync.

As an individual developer, version control lets me work on a big set of new features for one project without changing the files that are released to production. Then if the production version needs a small bug fix, I can easily revert to that, make and release the bug fix, then jump back to where I was making changes. ""...v2"" / ""v3"" / etc. doesn't let you control which version is the one everyone should be using.

(And super minor point, but agile and scrum are project management paradigms, not any type of version control - it's simply about how you organize and plan your work. They're popularized in the field programming, but are applicable to literally any project no matter they size of the team.)",2021-10-02 19:27:27
samdachemist,"For me I try to keep $$$ off centralized exchanges just because if you're in the US the government could theoretically freeze that crypto.  Even if you're not in the US but the exchange is you could be SOL if they turn against it.  

A couple things I look at for analyzing protocols for safety is age, total value locked and if there have been any audits.  Curve is a decentralized exchange that has high TVL and has been around for over a year.  They specialize in pools of ""like"" tokens to minimize impermanent loss, which is a problem for other exchanges especially stable-crypto pair and new tokens that could be rug pulls.    

So when I was saying borrow a stable and provide it to curve its for people to exchange Dai/USDC/USDT.  Curve charges \~0.05% on all transactions which is distributed proportionally to all people with stable coins locked into the protocol.  Beyond that you can earn ""extra"" on top in the form of CRV tokens which give voting rights over the CRV protocol.  

There's currently kind of a cold war going on between secondary protocols over curve in that both yEARN finance and Convex finance are trying to secure a larger supply of CRV tokens by offering additional rewards to people for locking their CRV tokens into the respective protocols in order to have voting power to control the Curve protocol.  

This is important because of the amount of volume that the Curve protocol does.  So I think Curve is very safe and I think that they have a lot of levers to generate more $$$ which should theoretically flow to the CRV token holders.  I provide liquidty to curve in order to get exposure to it (instead of a stable coin) by earning rewards in curve.  

Curve is probably the safest exchange you can provide liquidity on.  You could make the argument for Uniswap or Sushiswap as well, and I really like SUSHI but UNI not so much (because of centralization).  Convex just multiplies rewards for CRV.  Sorry if this runs on or if i didn't answer your questions, we can take this to DM as well if you want.",2021-10-02 21:17:21
KonekoBot,"[13 months here, my equity curve is an absolute roller coaster of emotion and sorrow, buts it's amazing! This industry is absolutely soul destroying, I'm not sure how finance guys who manage millions of other peoples' money can do it day in day out. Losing thousands and thousands myself (justified as tuition, happy to pay it) has been painful, but necessary. Every single well paying industry demands suffering to see success, doctors, lawyers, athletes.... They all suffer for their craft, and are only rewarded after perseverance and honest reflection on their shortcomings.  To be 100% honest, I'm also giving up (full-time) trading. It's absolutely ruined my work-life balance, I've grown up being a geek on the computer, and my leisure habits blend together with my work habits, it doesn't work very well. I've tried the full time thing, but I'll go back to my old job/career and focus on trading premarket/the open and lean on swing trading with wider stops. To touch on your last point, yea.....I thought I was so close @ 3 months, 6 months, and 10 months, and when you think you're close, the market will slap the fuck out of you, take your money, and laugh. It's 100% normal. Trading also doesn't require any special skills either, I believe LITERALLY anyone can do it with enough patience and grit.  I/we have no way of knowing, but if your biggest winner in 12 months is 0.30, you're trading the wrong stocks. Stock selection is just as important as planning, mental fortitude, research, and screen time. Again, not 100% sure, but I'd be willing to bet a large sum you're trading some penny stock garbage. Have you tried different types? Mega caps, indexes, small/mid caps, low floats... There's a lot of options and ways to trade, I think that's actually to the detriment of a lot of people at times. For examples, myself I've traded QS for 5 out of the last 7 trading days, LCID, NIO, SOFI, AFRM, all these have traded well, and I was never EVER looking for a 0.30 move. Perhaps adjust, paper trade (for fun) and think longer term. Some of the smarter furu's will say ""Trading is a get rich slow scheme"" and they couldn't be more correct.

jbrev01,"In r/defi you can find some good defi for beginners tutorials and information.

My only advice is to stay away from projects with a low TVL (total value locked). Defi is all transparent so you can search for the projects with the highest TVL. Those will be popular known projects like Uniswap, Sushiswap, Aave, Curve, Quickswap. And stay away from liquidity pools or lending with unknown coins and tokens.

Defi is an anomaly that probably won't last forever with the returns we're currently seeing. Take advantage while you can because when crypto and defi go mainstream in finance, we won't be seeing the kinds of returns we have right now.

Best place to get started now is Polygon network, an Ethereum side chain. Fees are really low ($0.0001) and has all the same big projects as ETH. There isn't much available yet on SmartBCH, and no big stablecoins or large tokens other than BCH to trade with or provide liquidity currently.

Also, use Metamask with a hardware wallet. I've seen way too many people have their crypto stolen by just using metamask and browser wallets alone.

Basically in defi, you lock your crypto into smart contracts as a liquidity provider. For example ETH and USDC. People use a decentralized site like Quickswap to trade their ETH for USDC or vice versa. That trade happens because of people proving liquidity by locking their crypto in the smart contact. And those liquidity providers get paid trading fees when the trade takes place.

There's also lending/borrowing. A defi loan, people can put their own crypto up as collateral and take out a loan, like a stablecoin. No banks involved, no paperwork or KYC verification, no loan qualification, etc.

If you look at the stock market like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, those are centralized companies that issue stock certificates to people, shares in publicly traded companies. That centralized company handles everything, so there's trust involved. In defi, a company could create their own tokens and issue those as stock shares. Everything is transparent on the blockchain, so there's no trust required, no centralized authority who has control over everything. In the future, defi could also handle things like property ownership. Who owns what property. And for an investment property, who owns what percentage of a property and so who gets paid what percentage of rental income. When you look at things like this, it's becomes obvious how much potential there is in defi - decentralized finance. And the fact that most of the defi stuff happening right now is on the ETH blockchain, even SmartBCH is an ETH side chain. Not to be an ETH shill, but you can see how and why ETH will most likely be the first cryptocurrency to take over Bitcoin Core BTC which has absolutely no use-value. Can't use it to spend easily and cheaply, can't move it easily. All they have is their illogical store of value narrative, and the hopes of a bunch of gambling speculators to get rich quick who have no idea that in order to have a store of value, it must first be a medium of exchange.

lenkellui,"As someone who works in energy finance, I can provide a bit deeper insight on this topic.

Energy is a bit of a unique market for a couple of reasons: geographic limitations and supply diversity. In energy we have something called the [dispatch curve](https://www.powerengineeringint.com/content/dam/pei/print-articles/2016/07/1608pei_22.jpg), which basically shows how much energy demand is required for an energy producer to ""turn on"" in a given region. There's many different types of energy with various costs. Some forms like nuclear are rather slow (and expensive) to turn on and off and may remain operational even its at a loss for short periods of time. Additionally, it's extremely inefficient to carry energy over long distances, so markets are isolated to the suppliers and offtakers within a region no larger than a couple of states/countries. Within these markets, there are nodes (centralized connections) and hubs (locations with many offtakers) in the network that all have unique market prices. Of course this stuff is just based on variable cost of production--economics 101 type stuff. 

There's more nuance to this than I'm letting on here, but the long flat portion of the curve is generally the ""spot price"" of energy--and after including overhead and government subsidy--the price passed onto consumers in the market. Here in the states, natural gas is the dominant source of energy in most markets, so while removing some cheaper suppliers of energy may move the spot price a bit, it would require a massive upheavel of suppliers to drastically move the needle. I'm not too familiar with what Woitrin is referencing, but the term ""phase out"" suggests that the process is deliberately slow. It is also very common for suppliers and offtakers to enter purchasing contracts (PPAs &amp; VPPAs) that entirely avoid the market price. These contracts can last up to 15 years and essentially tether the price of energy to around the contract strike for an offtaker. 

TL;DR: All this is to say that the energy market is by design price inelastic, and the claim that phasing out of nuclear power will not cause the consumer price of energy to explode is probably more correct than it is wrong.",2021-10-05 04:05:48

""Nobody Really Knows How the Economy Works. A Fed Paper Is the Latest Sign.  
Many experts are rethinking longstanding core ideas, including the importance of  
inflation expectations.  
Hitch-hiking during the gas shortage in Beaverton, Ore., in 1973.  
By Neil Irwin Oct. 1, 2021

  
It has long been a central tenet of mainstream economic theory that public fears of inflation tend to be self-fulfilling. Now though, a cheeky and even gleeful takedown of  
this idea has emerged from an unlikely source, a senior adviser at the Federal Reserve named Jeremy B. Rudd. His 27-page paper, published as part of the Fed’s Finance and  
Economics Discussion Series, has become what passes for a viral sensation among economists.

  
The paper disputes the idea that people’s expectations for future inflation matter much for the level of inflation experienced today. That is especially important right now, in trying to figure out whether the current inflation surge is temporary or not. But the Rudd paper is part of something bigger still. It reflects a broader rethinking of core ideas about how the  
economy works and how policymakers, especially at central banks, try to manage things. This shift has also included debates about the relationship between unemployment and inflation, how deficit spending affects the economy, and much more. In effect, many of the key ideas underlying economic policy during the Great Moderation — the period of relatively steady growth and low inflation from the mid-1980s to 2007 that also seems to be a high-water mark for economists’ overconfidence — increasingly look to be at best incomplete, and at worst wrong. It is vivid evidence that macroeconomics, despite the thousands of highly intelligent people over centuries who have tried to figure it out, remains, to an uncomfortable degree, a black box. The ways that millions of people bounce off one another — buying and selling, lending and borrowing, intersecting with governments and central banks and businesses and everything else around us — amount to a system so complex that no human fully comprehends it.  


“Macroeconomics behaves like we’re doing physics after the quantum revolution, that we really understand at a fundamental level the forces around us,” said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an  
interview. “We’re really at the level of Galileo and Copernicus,” just figuring out the basics of how the universe works.  
“It requires more humility and acceptance that not everything fits into one model yet,” he said. Or put less politely, as Mr. Rudd writes in the first sentence of his paper, “Mainstream economics is replete with ideas that ‘everyone knows’ to be true, but that are actually  
arrant nonsense.” One reason for this, he posits: “The economy is a complicated system that is inherently difficult to understand, so propositions like these” — the arrant nonsense in question — “are all that saves us from intellectual nihilism.” And from that starting point, a staff economist at the world’s most powerful central bank went on to say, in effect,  
that his own employer has been focused on the wrong things for the last few decades.  
Importers were worried about the effect of the 10 percent duty imposed by President Nixon on foreign-made items as part of his new economic “game plan” to halt inflation.

  
Mainstream policymakers, very much including Mr. Rudd’s bosses at the Fed, believe that inflation is, in large part, self-fulfilling — that what people expect future inflation to look  
like has an ability to shape how much prices rise in the near term. In the common telling, the Great Inflation of the 1970s got going because people came to believe inflation would keep spiraling. The surge in gasoline prices wasn’t simply a frustrating development, but a harbinger of things to come, so people needed to demand higher raises, and businesses could feel confident charging higher prices for most everything. In this story, the great achievement of the Fed in the early 1980s was to break this cycle by re-establishing credibility that it would not allow sustained high inflation (though at the cost of a severe recession). That is why today’s discussions over the inflation outlook often spend a lot of time focusing on things like what bond prices suggest inflation will be five or 10 years from now, or how people answer survey questions about what they expect. Mr. Rudd argues that there is no solid evidence that the conventional story of the 1970s describes the real mechanism through which inflation takes place. He says there’s a simpler explanation consistent with the data: that businesses and workers arrive at prices and wages based on the conditions they’ve experienced in the recent past, not some abstract future forecast.  


For example, when inflation has been low in the recent past, workers might not demand raises as they would in a world where inflation was high; after all, their existing paychecks go pretty much as far as they used to. You don’t need some theory involving inflation expectations to get there. Some economists who are sympathetic to the idea that central bankers have overly fetishized precise measurements of inflation expectations aren’t ready to fully dismiss the idea. For example, Mr. Posen, a former Bank of England policymaker, says there remains a simple and hard-to-dispute idea about inflation expectations supported by lots of history: 

  that if people distrust a country’s monetary system, inflation shocks can spiral upward. Economic policy credibility matters. But that isn’t the same as assuming that some survey or bond market measure of what will happen to inflation in the distant future is particularly  
meaningful for forecasting the near future. “It has been a noble lie that has become a  
critical part of the catechism of global monetary policy, that long-term inflation expectations are not just interesting but are a decisive determinant of real-time inflation,” said Paul McCulley, a former Pimco chief economist, commenting on Mr. Rudd’s paper.

  
This isn’t the only way in which basic precepts underlying economic policy are shifting beneath economists’ feet. Particularly prominently, for years central bankers believed there was a tight relationship between the unemployment rate and inflation, known as the Phillips Curve. Over the course of the 2000s, though, that relationship appeared to weaken  
and become a less reliable guideline for how to set policy. Similarly, interest rates and inflation fell worldwide, for reasons that scholars are still trying to understand fully. That implied a lower “neutral interest rate,” or the rate that neither stimulates nor slows the economy, than was widely believed to be the case as recently as the mid-2010s. In many ways, the Fed’s policies just before the pandemic were aimed at incorporating those lessons and embracing sustained lower interest rates — and the possibility of lower  
unemployment — than many in the mainstream thought reasonable a few years earlier.

  
In the realm of fiscal policy, some conventional wisdom has also been upended in the last few years. It was thought that large government debt issuance would risk causing a spike in interest rates and crowd out private sector investment. But in that period, huge budget deficits have been paired with low interest rates and abundant credit for businesses. All of this makes it a challenging time for central bankers and other shapers of policy. “If you’re a  
policymaker and you don’t have robust confidence in the parameters of the game you are managing, it makes your job a whole lot more difficult,” Mr. McCulley said. But if you are in charge of making economic policy that affects the lives of millions, you can’t simply shrug your shoulders and say, “We don’t know how the world works, so what are we supposed to do?” You look at the evidence available, and make the best judgment you can. And then, if you think it turns out you were wrong about something, publish a sassy paper to try to get it right.""",2021-10-05 05:00:02

1. Put at least 20% down.
2. Finance for 36 months or less.
3. Don't let the monthly payment exceed 8% of your monthly gross income.
4. Don't let the monthly payment exceed your monthly retirement savings.

The first two keep you ahead of the depreciation curve. Many people have ended up in financial trouble because their car was either totalled in an accident or had a major mechanical problem and they owed more than it was worth. A large down payment and short loan make it highly likely you will always have positive equity, even with models with higher than average depreciation. If you get a used car, which I strongly recommend for your situation, you have some wiggle room here. The thumb rules are for new cars and based on the significant depreciation that happens in the first fre years. Look up the value and expected depreciation for cars you are considering and come up with a plan to maintain positive equity and pay it off in a reasonable amount of time.

The last two look after your balance sheet. In general, the more you spend on a car the more your net worth is going to take a hit due to depreciation. Keeping the monthly payment to a small percentage of your income limits the price of the car you buy and therefore the depreciation loss you take. It also prevents the car payment from being a burden on your monthly budget. Prioritizing retirement savings over a car payment makes sure that the car does not side track your financial future.",2021-10-06 11:26:03

jaytilala27,"Interest rates are calculated on various risk metrics and demand and supply of loans and invested capital. Just like how it was done 50 years ago, before federal govt. and ECB, and Japan decided to indirectly control borrowing rates through bank rates and repo rates. 

Let's say that supply of capital is $100M and demand for loans is also $100M, and the risk metrics decides that interest on loans is 6% and investors will get 5%. Now, imagine, demand for loan increases from $100M to $200M, this would trigger in risk metrics to charge more rates on loan, let's say 10% and give 9% to investors. If investors gets 9% in return, that would mean more people would provide capital and slowly the demand and supply will come closer to equilibrium.

Now, let's say invested capital in $200M and loan demand is only $100M, this means borrowers would pay less interests as supply is high, and investors would get less returns. This would encourage more borrowing since rates are low. 

Also, Defi allows fixed rate loans and variable rate loans as well, so investors and borrowers can choose which one they want.

Talking about yield curve, that's more of a concept of traditional finance because we have some specific time periods for bonds, like 1 month, 3 months, 10 years, and so on.

sneakpeek_bot,"&gt; # Mothership Explains: Does S'pore really have 'one of the most Covid-naive populations in the world'?

&gt; At the recent Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) press conference on Oct. 2, finance minister and MTF co-chair Lawrence Wong called Singapore's population ""one of the most Covid-naive populations in the world"".

&gt; Wong said this in his opening remarks at the press conference, while giving an update on the overall Covid-19 situation in Singapore.

&gt; He mentioned that particular phrase while explaining that Singapore's overall strategy to reopening — geared toward living with Covid-19 as an endemic disease, rather than trying to eliminate it altogether — has not changed.

&gt; He explained that new restrictions were put in place as part of what the MTF has called the ""stabilisation phase"", because of ""tremendous stresses on our healthcare system"" and said that procedures and protocols would need ""a little bit of time"", which is why the recent restrictions were imposed.

&gt; Wong then said that Singapore should be prepared that the current big wave of cases we are experiencing will not be the last.

&gt; The reason why we should expect more waves of cases in future?

&gt; ""We are one of the most Covid-naive populations in the world,"" he said, before comparing Singapore's experience to that of ""many European countries"" — though he did not mention which ones in particular.

&gt; What it means to be ""Covid-naive""

&gt; To be naive typically means to be inexperienced or innocent, perhaps even gullible.

&gt; Surely Wong would know better than to call Singaporeans naive, you might be thinking.

&gt; However, there is another different meaning of ""naive"" in the medical field — specifically, when one is talking about drugs, or a person's immune system.

&gt; In other words, to be naive to the Covid-19 virus simply means that these individuals are ""not previously infected"", as clarified in a World Health Organisation (WHO) scientific brief on Covid-19 natural immunity.

&gt; Why should Covid-naive Singapore expect future waves of cases?

&gt; As Wong went on to explain, some countries in Europe are not as Covid-naive as Singapore.

&gt; This means that a larger proportion of their populations had been previously infected with Covid-19.

&gt; Wong explained that those countries had high fatalities when they went through their waves of Covid-19 infection in the past year or so, prior to vaccines being rolled out.

&gt; These high fatalities were the ""high price"" that these countries paid for a higher level of natural immunity — that is, immunity from being infected with Covid-19, as opposed to immunity from getting vaccinated.

&gt; This natural immunity, as well as successful vaccination programmes, means that many of these countries now have ""a new Covid-stable situation"", Wong explained.

&gt; Such countries have been able to relax restrictions, while avoiding a resurgence of cases.

&gt; In Singapore, on the other hand, infections were kept low ""for a very long time"", Wong highlighted.

&gt; Here's a simple summary of the comparison that Wong made.

&gt; So is being Covid-naive a bad thing?

&gt; To Wong, Singapore is ""fortunate"" in many ways to be in a different position than our European counterparts.

&gt; Many of those countries experienced their waves of infections prior to, or while vaccines were being rolled out.

&gt; However, Singapore is experiencing its current wave of infections with high vaccination rates.

&gt; This means that most of Singapore's population will be protected against serious illness even if infected.

&gt; ""That also means that we can get through this, and any subsequent waves with fewer casualties than the European countries,"" said Wong.

&gt; But does this mean permanent restrictions?

&gt; Wong said that Singapore will reach a point, ""perhaps months later"", where we will have high vaccinations and high natural immunity.

&gt; If you've been reading closely so far, you'd know that this means we would no longer be Covid-naive by then.

&gt; According to Wong, when this point arrives, Singapore will be ""able to reopen more confidently without seeing a new wave of cases.""

&gt; Ironically, however, Singapore will reach this point of high natural immunity more quickly if restrictions on social gatherings are relaxed, or even removed.

&gt; However, this would come at the expense of the healthcare system, as a surge in infections would not only result in reduced capacity to treat Covid-19 patients with severe symptoms, as well as those with other non-Covid-19 illnesses.

&gt; Thus, the relevance of something you might find familiar from the early days of the pandemic: Flattening the curve.

&gt; Are we still Covid-naive even with almost-85% vaccinated?

&gt; Some might be wondering why past infection rates even matter, since after all, Singapore's Covid-naive population also happens to be one of the most highly vaccinated in the world.

&gt; However, the past infection rates could make a significant difference, as past infection along with vaccination has been said to produce the ""best protection"" against Covid-19 and its variants.

&gt; In many other countries, big waves of infections followed by vaccination meant that significant segments of their population have both natural immunity, and immunity from vaccination — with this outcome having come at the cost of many deaths, and in some cases, an overburdened healthcare system.

&gt; In Singapore, lots of us have the vaccine, but no past infection to confer us with that ""best protection"", which makes us Covid-naive.

&gt; How Covid-naive are we, actually?

&gt; How do Singapore's infections compare to other countries' rates?

&gt; Are we in fact — in Wong's words — ""one of the most Covid-naive populations in the world""?

&gt; Here's a comparison of infection and fatality rates in Singapore (in red), some of the countries that Wong may have been referring to, as well as some countries closer to home, as of Oct. 1, 2021:

&gt; Singapore ranks 98th of 238 on the WHO's list, when countries/territories are ranked from least infections per 100,000 to most infections:

&gt; Singapore does better, however, if we are ranking countries from those which saw the lowest fatalities per 100,000, placing 40th in WHO's list:

&gt; It's important to note that the data is only accurate to the extent that countries are able to detect and report cases, of course.

&gt; It would be useful to bear in mind, however, that Singapore has conducted extensive testing operations whenever Covid-19 cases spiked, as well as for all close contacts of positive cases, meaning that the numbers are not likely to be seriously under-reported.

&gt; Singapore has also continued to insist on testing widely, with Wong's fellow MTF co-chair and health minister Ong Ye Kung explaining that Singapore would continue its practice of testing even asymptomatic cases, at the same Oct. 2 press conference.

&gt; Also, the data is only updated till Oct. 1, 2021, and the additional days since then could well push Singapore's infection and death rates higher than what the WHO data currently shows.

&gt; That being said, the fact that we are seeing unprecedented numbers now means that we are moving further and further from being Covid-naive.

&gt; But this also means that we are on the path to natural immunity, and closer to the lifting of restrictions and ""normal"" life, as far as possible.

&gt; More of what Wong actually said

&gt; If you want to read more, here's the fuller context of what Wong said:

&gt; ""Our overall strategy to reopening has not changed. But this is the first time we are experiencing such a big wave, and it is causing tremendous stresses on our healthcare system and our healthcare workers. Procedures, protocols have to be changed and adjusted, new capacity has to be added into the system. All these take a little bit of time, and that is why we are putting in place these measures in the stabilisation phase so that we can get all these things ready. Even as we go about this exercise during this period, this week and over the next few weeks, I think we should also be prepared that this will not be the last wave we experience. We are riding one major, one big wave now, but we should be mentally prepared that there will be subsequent waves to follow. Why is that so? It is because we are one of the most Covid-naive populations in the world. Unlike for example, many other European countries, we have kept infections in Singapore low for a very long time. Many European countries experienced large waves last year. If you recall, they went through these waves before they had the chance for their people to be vaccinated, and many countries ended up paying a high price, suffering high fatalities because of the waves that they experienced last year. But now, they have a much higher level of natural immunity, and together with the vaccination programmes that they have introduced, many of these countries have reached a new Covid-stable situation where they are able to resume activities and they have not seen any resurgence of cases. We are in a different position. In many ways, we are fortunate because we are facing this wave now with a much more highly vaccinated population, and that means that the vast majority of our people will be protected against serious illness. That also means that we can get through this, and any subsequent waves with fewer casualties than the European countries. Eventually, we will reach a point with high vaccinations and with a higher level of natural immunity, we too will eventually reach a point, perhaps months later, where we are more similar to the European countries, and the Covid-19 situation stabilises, and we are able to reopen more confidently without seeing a new wave of cases.""

jumnhy,"Yeah, i expect the regulatory framework to evolve here. 

I don't know tax law for shit, but these sorts of structures do already exist in legacy finance, albeit with a few more layers of obfuscation. In ten years, it'll be just as hard to understand what's going on in DeFi as it is to understand the Evergrande crisis or what happened in 2008.

Asset backed securities, i believe is the term. Buy assets that are expected to accrue value (debt obligations, like credit card receivables, auto loans, etc--for abracadabra and Alchemix it's mostly money markets by means of Year or Curve or both).

Buy said assets by selling/issuing a security that has nominal worth (ie, a stablecoin).

It's not totally new, but instead of a ""special purpose vehicle"" being created to handle the purchasing/issuance process, we have smart contracts handling it.

Cut out the middle man, and suddenly everyone can access these sorts of products.

Beechbone22,"It's a DEX on Polygon. AFAIK the contracts are a fork of Uniswap V2, so general purpose AMM. No concentrated liquidity and fee tiers like Uniswap V3 or low slippage trades focused on non volatile pairs like Curve. Pretty much a no frills DEX. You might also want to check out DFYN and Sushiswap's Polygon dApp. They fill similar niches. I haven't checked the TVL's recently but Quickswap should be the leader. But do keep in mind that QUICK is a farming token rewarded to LP's and if they compound their position via something like Beefy finance, or another compounder, that could mean constant sell pressure, especially since Polygon is not as ""hot"" right now. As I said, you might like the protocol but the native asset might not necessarily be a good investment. Farm tokens tend to be a bonus you get for LPing and if you have Quickswap LP positions you can choose to hold on to the QUICK you farm because well free money, right? But it might not make sense to actually buy QUICK if you don't have LP positions.",2021-10-07 00:01:52

Decentralized ledger technologies provide fundamental competitive advantages over traditional finance.

Specifically the reduction to counterparty risk coupled with much faster finality provides compelling advantages over 3 day settlement times and trust in regional rule-of-law.

The disadvantages is how new the industry is. Scaling, regulatory unknowns, a relatively steep learning curve, and only being a 2 trillion dollar asset class.

I argue the disadvantages in the crypto industry can (and will) be fixed much faster than the disadvantages in the traditional finance industry. 

The rate of development in crypto; the bleeding edge of mathematics/computer science/game theory; the fundamental advantages over traditional finance; not to mention erosion of US-Dollar-as-global-reserve-currency means crypto is much, much more than a Ponzi scheme.",2021-10-08 00:13:02
Tacoman404,"Zero tolerance for zeroes. Meaning that we had a stupid and awkward focus on getting kids to pass that made my middle school and high school experience especially dull. Electives were short and underfunded. There was a plethora of extra math and English classes that you could once upon a time call remedial. 

Oddly some of the more ""remedial"" English classes actually focused a lot on post modern and contemporary literature while the mainline ones did not. It's kind of fucked because if given the choice I would have never picked classic US or English lit over my Post Modern and Comtemporary lit classes I ended up having to take after failing US and English lit anyway.

Our remedial math class was basically personal and business finance that was only available if you weren't passing Algebra 2.

In middle school you were placed on what they thought you could pass. My in class assignments, tests, and quizzes were always exemplary but my record with homework and projects wasn't great because I had a really unstable home life relative to the majority of my peers. So I got kicked into underachiever classes in 8th grade and got stuck behind the curve through all of high school. Still salty to this day if you can't tell.",2021-10-08 00:33:51

crickyb24,"Just by asking this question you’re already ahead of the curve. Just remember that building wealth isn’t about what you make, it’s about what you keep. First, try to write down a general budget that lists all of your recurring monthly expenses (rent, car, utilities, food, etc.) - it doesn’t have to be perfect but it’ll give you an idea of how much money you need to pay out vs what is left over. This process may help you realize that you’re spending more than you’d like on certain things (e.g., maybe you’re spending half your income going out to eat). Next step is to determine what to do with your left over money after monthly expenses. Building an emergency fund of cash is a solid first step. Next, paying off debt is nearly always the right decision. If you have no debt, then you’ll want to start investing some money for retirement. You can open an account called a “Roth IRA” which will allow you to invest your money in a way that helps save on taxes. In the meantime, try watching some personal finance YouTube channels (Dave Ramsey, graham stephan, etc.) to start increasing your knowledge on the topic of personal finance.",2021-10-08 14:48:12

brandnewredditacct,"The risk of all stocks is that they can go down a lot at any time, for any reason. You can obviously use margin to invest and trade, but you must understand the “risk” involved. This is a misunderstood word when it comes to finance. It’s not “risky” in the sense that danger is likely, it’s risky in the sense that if this goes south, you’re going to lose much much much more money than the measly 13% dividend you’re collecting a year. The Covid sell-off put in context against the larger bear markets in stock market history is chump change. As long as you understand the bell curve of possible outcomes, and decided that the reward outweighs the risks…

Additionally, the s&amp;p returns about 8-10% annually. I’m not too sure piling into a div etf on margin for a few % more is worth it. As some other people have said, there’s much better ways to deploy 100k than this.",2021-10-09 19:35:12
SoNotYou,"Autocompounders like Beefy finance. Basically you pick a Stable LP of which you trust the underlining tokens to stay $1 and a trustable project that wont rugpull. For example Quickswaps usdc-dai pool on polygon or Curve mimpool on Arbitrum. Get that LP in exchange they give you a token thay represent you share of the pool. Now you deposit that in an autocompounder like Beefy. They sell the reward token you get for providing liquidity for LP shares and take a fee for doing so.

I used Beefy as an example here since they are on the most chains. Most people here will be one of the chains they support.",2021-10-10 05:15:46

Polythereum,"Kind of.

Centralized Finance means exactly that.  A company owns and operates the exchange as a business, you know, for profit.  They ""own"" all the crypto on the exchange.

Decentralized Finance means no person or organization is the custodian.  The services are executed by software programs (smart contracts).

There are different risks associated with each, although at this time, the community generally regards bluechip exchanges as approximately equally safe.

Bluechip CEXs include the likes of Coinbase and Kraken.

Bluechip DEXs are things like AAVE and Curve.",2021-10-10 05:34:01
SoNotYou,"You can start with any amount. There is no minimum, of course the more you put in the more you earn. Just be aware of gas cost and if its worth it. Since you have take a few gasextensive actions.

Get the stablecoin(s) so do a swap on a dex to get the required stable. This is case only if you dont have the stable yet of course. Most* would require to put 50% stable1 and 50% stable in LP. So you need 250usdc and 250dai for example and cant use 500usdc only. So this would require 2 swaps to get both stables. 

LP them on the exchange (!! Note the LP needs to get rewarded with a token) 

Put the LP on an autocompounder.

This are 4 (could be 3) gas extensive transactions.

I would recommend trying this out with a few dollar on Polygon or similar cheap chain to get the hang of it. Like use quickswap and beefy finance for example. 

*LPs are pool where the 2 tokens in pool are always worth the same amount. For example a pool of 1 eth and 3500usdc. You put in both tokens so that you dont move the price on the dex. Exception is Curve since they treat all stables as =1$ (or =€1 for euro stable) no matter whats in the pool and thats why you can only deposit one stable there.",2021-10-10 05:45:26
Ieperen,"I did the same thing a while back and have been enjoying my gains since. 

As for reasons not to: smart contract risk. And as these products get more and more layered, something that doesn't get talked about much is how smart contract risk increases with every dapp that liquidity gets run through. 

An example:
I deposited my MIM2CRV tokens into the pickle finance contract on arbitrum for automatic compouding and added pickle rewards. An exploit in any one of the following protocols can destroy or severely impact my position:  
 - Pickle Finance  
 - MIM  
 - USDC  
 - USDT  
 - Curve  
 - Arbitrum  

Most of these have been around for quite a while so I feel comfortable in my position, but I would not recommend aping your entire stack into any product that depends on so many things going right. With time these products will only grow more complex, and most of the time that'll be fine, but I think it's good to remind yourself every now and again just how tall some of these defi Jenga towers are becoming.",2021-10-10 06:56:26
Ieperen,"Asked about this in the discord, the Curve LP rewards are currently not taken into account in the APY calculations. They are working on adding this, but this means that you would receive that 35% on top of the spell and pickle rewards. 

Even so, since Pickle finance takes a 20% cut on emission rewards it might still be a better idea to manually compound, depending on the size of your stack and your available time.",2021-10-10 08:03:32
qjornt,"Yeah that's kind of the problem this world suffers from. No equal opportunity is most countries, makes a lot of people miss out on becoming something with their talents. Most successful people are successful because they know the right people and because they've been handed great quality education or training most people can't afford. It takes hard work but most people don't have access to that, no matter how much you work.

I would like to talk about myself as an example in a country where opportunities are more equal than it is in the USA for example, it's a long read so beware if you can't bother. My family fled the balkan war in 1994 to Sweden with literally only our clothes and cash that amounted to $10. That's what we had when we ended up in Sweden, me being 4 months old. During the immigration process my parents would have to learn Swedish, my dad worked for a temporary work agency and moved between different jobs while my mom had to redo some high school classes to get access to university. My parents were 28 and 24 years old at this point. I grew up in a decent neighborhood, went to elementary school and had ""talent"" for math, in reality I just love puzzle solving and math is that to me so I would spend a lot of time studying math as a kid. My mom then went to university, got money from the government like every student does (instead of having to pay insane amounts of money like you do in the USA, my point about equal opportunity), and my dad finally ended up getting a normal full time job at an office due to hard work. It's not a good paid job, he's has Swedish median income. My mom ended up just recently becoming HR manager at a Swedish government agency and her salary is in the 95th percentile. Me, after three great and fun years in high school I went on to study applied physics and electrical engineering, again, I'm given money equal to $300 per month and a student loan of $700 per month at an interest rate of 0.16% per year (currently it's 0.12%), more than enough to pay for rent, food, alcohol, and books. After graduating university I started working in finance, currently I'm a quant analyst making just below $100k/year, though that's including bonuses, almost four years into my career. Literally from rags to riches without having to take the immense risk of indebting ourselves to oblivion, because that's what an equal opportunity does to people who want an opportunity to become something. And on top of this, at about one year old I was diagnosed with hemophilia, which scared my parents but in a country like Sweden it's entirely manageable and my quality of life is equal to someone who does not have hemophilia, because of the medicine Sweden provides to people. All I need to pay is a deductible of $200 per year for medicine that costs $150000 per year.

Sure, taxes are higher here. It literally doesn't bother me one bit because first of all I'd be the biggest hypocrite ever if it did mainly because of nationalized health insurance giving me $150k worth of medicine to stay fully functional and alive. Second of all because it literally doesn't affect my quality of life. I own (not rent) a big one bedroom one livingroom apartment with a huge ass balcony, I eat out whenever I feel lazy to make my own food, I buy the things I need without thinking about if I have enough money, I manage to save at least $1k minimum per month which I just throw into stonks, and I'm holding $15k in a cash account for emergencies which I've never had to tap into, not yet at least. And when bonus month arrives, that's a whole other story. So while it looks like I'm bragging here, I was only laying out the foundation to what I want to say next: People with high incomes who complain about ""high income taxes"" are the absolute worst. I can't spend my money fast enough and I just keep piling it up in assets. Sure I can't buy a yacht with my assets without taking a loan, but why would I want to? And evenso I'll be able to in a matter of years because I'm young and have a very steep salary increase curve on a year to year basis, considering the business I'm in. I'm actively voting for the left party because I want to equalize opportunities further, even if it means I have to pay more taxes (left party wants to increase taxes for higher incomes and lower it for lower incomes), because it won't affect my quality of life negatively in the slightest, it will give poorer families more money to keep, and it will make society a much better place with less misery and as a consequence less violent crime, and that way even increase my own quality of life.",2021-10-10 17:17:04

Math_Is_Funnn,"Speaking as a Canadian university grad, preparing for my fifth SOA exam.

Depending on the rules at your university regarding major/minor combinations, why not do both? For me, I was a math major with an economics minor (and a CS minor, but that got added later on). One of my former roommates did the opposite -- he was an economics major with a math minor. 

Regardless of what you study, unless you're enrolled in an actuarial science program (which my University didn't have), the exams are always going to be a large learning curve. Any probability or statistics-related class you can take will help a lot with some of the of the exams, and the same is true for finance-related classes (though maybe not anymore as they're scrapping IFM). Multivariable calculus is vital. Economics won't help you with the exams as much, but I've met many actuaries here who studied it -- as long as you're comfortable self-studying math, you'll be fine.

Best of luck!",2021-10-11 11:01:36
Lifter_Dan,"If you're good with crypto you can keep on compounding that after ""cashing out"" to stablecoins like USDC and UST.

Assuming you have some knowledge of DEFI?

Knowing DEFI is a skill that only a very small percentage of the population have. Having money AND knowing DEFI is a potent combination.

Even some of the low-risk returns like Curve finance stable pools on Arbitrum or Fantom pay a good percentage.

Two downsides I'm working through:

1. DEFI is very time consuming - to me it is ""My Job"". It earns better yield than traditional finance but I have to be constantly moving money around, avoiding risk and chasing higher yield. A week in crypto is like 3 months in the real world.. If you want to do something else with your time or take a different job/business DEFI is not ideal.
2. Gary Gennsler and the US crypto regulation. Stablecoin regulation is coming. What will happen to our stablecoins when it does.",2021-10-11 11:51:12

Math_Is_Funnn,"I graduated University with a 2.8 GPA, no internships or relevant work experience, and only one exam passed (I took P during the summer before my junior year, so I wouldn't have to study for it at the same time as my classes). Despite that, I landed an entry level position one month post-graduation. It's absolutely possible for you to become an actuary still.

1) The syllabus for both these exams is on the SOA's website. If you go into the exams with no background except for multivariable calculus (cal 3, if you can get up to that point, is all the mathematical background you'll need), you can learn the rest of the concepts on your own (but be prepared to study a LOT to do it). For me I studied through doing hundreds of practice questions on Coaching Actuaries and from downloading a couple of study manuals online.

2) You'll need at least one exam passed to be considered for even an internship in the actuarial world. Quite simply, most employers require proof that you're capable of passing the exams, as you'll be required throughout your employment to continue taking them. Though most places ask for 2-3 exams complete at the start, it is possible to get hired with 1. But I've never heard of someone being hired with 0 exams. Your first step should be to get through one exam. Beyond that, just keep applying! Focus on positions that don't ask for a transcript - your GPA won't matter if you don't have to share it.

3) If you graduate and haven't passed any exams, go sign up for one of the exams. You won't break into the field until you do.

4) It doesn't actually matter what you major in. Me, I studied math. But my coworkers have engineering degrees, economics degrees, finance degrees, etc. At the end of the day, they just want you to have a degree in something (to show that you're able to follow through a task to the end), and then the rest of their judgement rests on your exams. Honestly, you could even major in philosophy and then become an actuary, though if you haven't taken any higher-level math classes in Uni it'll be a much greater learning curve.

Good luck!",2021-10-11 23:53:00
ExoticCommunication,"Calculus just makes stats and finance MUCH easier if you can do a basic derivative. It’s one thing to measure change, it’s another to measure the RATE of change and figure out where you want something to be on a curve. I wish more people understood basic functions beyond “silly S curve thingy looks silly.” Even in my field (partnership management and business development) understanding the THINKING around rates of change can be useful. 

But thank you for expanding on the others, yep. I can do the same in my field alllll day.",2021-10-12 04:00:18
Gig4t3ch,"&gt;You really think they've come up with some new math?

Yes, because the majority of their employees could have been employed as researchers at some of the most respected universities in the world. I don't just think they've come up with new models, I'm certain they have come up with new models. Look at some of the [people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ax) they [hired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_E._Baum). 

&gt;That they are the first guys to try to mathematically analyze the stock market?

They're the first to do it as rigorously as they have done. Tons of models in finance have had issues where they use incorrect assumptions. The original Black-Scholes model, probalby the most well known option pricing model, incorrectly assumes that volatility is constant. Now every single bank I can think of quotes options in terms of volatility.


And I believe before 2008 large amounts of banks used the same interest rate curve for discounting and pricing swaps. And everyone assumed the spread between things like LIBOR6M and LIBOR3M was nonexistent, which is also now widely understood to be incorrect. 


The point is that there is still a lot of room for research in finance, and even things that are considered basic have the potential to be improved.",2021-10-12 04:19:04
ThrowawayAccount5260,"I still ask myself this question lol. While I didn't have a great college GPA, it wasn't for lack of intelligence. And at the risk of sounding arrogant, I think when talking to people in an interview or something it's pretty clear I'm not an idiot or something. I just had a hard transition to college which tanked my grades my first semester and that was hard to recover from GPA-wise. I even took a 5th year to graduate.

Beyond that, I didn't really have that stellar of a resume. My only internship experience was my senior year when I interned the full year with the local (small) united way office. My internship was supposed to be working with the finance manager, but they were let go a month into my internship. Not long after, the other 2 employees left and weren't replaced. So for the rest of the school year it was just me and the director. In the end I think it was beneficial because it gave me the opportunity to help with a wide variety of business operations I wouldn't have been able to otherwise because just the 2 of us were working there. (At least that's how I spun the experience in interviews)

Other than that, I did run a small (very small) business a few summers while in college so I'm sure that showed competency with business functions, especially cost management which is a huge portion of my job.

I also think I personally had a bit of an advantage because the defense contractor I work for makes mostly aircraft and I've had a lifelong aviation passion with several hours towards a private pilot's license. So in my interview I sold them on the idea that I'd have a much smaller learning curve for the business than someone with no knowledge/passion for aviation.

So at the end of the day, while I didn't have a great resume or experience, I had a lot I could sell myself on for this particular job with this particular company. I'm not sure it would've worked out as well at another F500 company. I actually passed on applying to my current company for months because I assumed I didn't have a strong enough resume. But thankfully it worked out and hopefully I can build my career upwards using this experience",2021-10-12 04:34:09

[Realistically both can do very well.  1 year PLTR. Amount of contracts is great. They’re small money but they’re adding up.   5/10 Tesla.   5 because I’m predicting Tesla to simply outpace all other automakers for another 5 years. At this point, Tesla is pumping out cars while everyone else is attempting to catch up. Many startups with advanced tech will be bought up to aid the catch up, but I don’t think it’ll make a big difference.   10 years is Tesla solely because around that time we will have hit 1.5 degrees of warming in climate change. We are currently guaranteed 30 years of warming. We are also guaranteed to hit the 2.0 degrees if we hit 1.5 in sub 10 years. At that point in time I expect the world to hit the panic button. Panic button means massive tax credits and green industry investment. Tesla is very well positioned to benefit from such a catalyst with residential solar and more than likely shipping over 1.5 million cars a year by then.](/r/stocks/comments/q5kk1r/if_you_had_to_choose_one_stock_between_tsla_and/hg6pffg/)

Pure data integration &amp; analytics plays are rare at the moment I think.      But I think investing into Tesla is much less risky.

They pay you a higher rate the more of their CRV token that you own, and call it tokenomics rather than ponzi. If you're not greedy, you can just sell the junk tokens as you get them so it doesn't really matter if they crash in price, or you can automate the process through another platform like Yearn Finance to handle the dirty work for you so you can just keep accumulating your underlying asset rather than deal with the junk tokens yourself.",2021-10-13 03:34:32
mxyz,"It's risky, but not volatile. My highest risk defi play has been paying about 100% APY for the last couple weeks and I will move it if something better comes along.

The risks are so many levels deep. First of all, I'm using Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer 2 chain. A layer 2 chain inherits the security of the main chain, but it's officially still in BETA. It hasn't ever been rolled back, but something catastrophic could happen.

Next, to make that rate, I'm using three different stablecoins, each pegged to the price of the dollar in some way. I have these stablecoins put into a liquidity pool on the decentralized exchange Curve. Curve is considered one of the lowest risk defi platforms in existence on the main Ethereum chain. Now, if any of these 3 stablecoins becomes worthless, arbitragers are going to drain the pool and leave me with the worthless one. So right there I 3x'd my risk for stablecoins losing their peg to the dollar.

Curve liquidity pools pay the liquidity providers in a few ways. First, they collect trading fees from users using the pool. Just like Coinbase or other centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges also charge a fee. These fees get collected by the liquidity providers. It's like owning the actual means of exchange instead of stock in a company like coinbase. It's playing the house in the casino. And as long as the 3 stablecoins keep their peg to the dollar, I don't care which one I own. Whenever I decide to exit, I can choose any or all of the 3 stablecoins to withdraw. The second way Curve pays rewards is by giving away their CRV token and sometimes promotional tokens from another platform. In this case, one of the three stablecoins I'm using is offering their own incentive giving away their own token called SPELL to curve liquidity providers.

But do I want these junk tokens? No way! And do I want to manage converting this junk and pay gas fees each time? No again! I just want to watch the number go up. So I take my IOU I get for providing liquidity to Curve and hand over control to software run by Beefy Finance. That smart contract uses it to farm the SPELL and CRV and trade it for more shares of the Curve liquidity position. This starts compounding my gains multiple times per day with only a tiny amount of exposure to the price of SPELL and CRV. The worst that could happen from those tokens crashing in value is that my rewards start going down and I find the next promo offer that satisfies my risk/reward tolerance.",2021-10-13 09:02:59

Findings from an analysis by the Ministry of Health (MoH) on the cases during the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak as of Tuesday showed that despite the second wave not showing a decrease, it is however stable and not showing an increase. The weekly average of new cases per day has also decreased from 183 per day to 148.




Minister of Health Dato Seri Setia Dr Haji Mohd Isham bin Haji Jaafar shared these details during the daily press conference yesterday.




Dato Seri Setia Dr Haji Mohd Isham said, “A total of 9,132 cases have been reported since the second wave began on August 6 where 9,082 (99.5 per cent) were local transmission cases while 50 were imported cases.”




Based on the dates the cases underwent swab tests, the graph displaying the epidemic curve for the second wave to date also shows the ‘doubling time’ whereby the period for the total number of cases to double is 28.8 days, compared to three to four days when the second wave first occurred. Meanwhile, the reproduction number for the second wave, where the basic reproduction number (R-naught) is the reproduction number when the second wave first occurred, is at level 5.




“At the beginning of the second wave, one positive case caused five new cases. Currently, the effective reproduction number, R(t), is at level 1, which means that one positive case caused one new case. The R(t) at level 1 also indicates a stable state of infection,” said the minister.









In relation to Operasi Pulih conducted since October 4, the minister said, “Out of the 1,756 cases detected, 61 per cent of the cases involved the workplace or staff houses housing the companies’ employees. Only nine per cent were related to household cases or cases where the families lived in private homes.”




The total cases in Category 4 and 5 treated at the National Isolation Centre are all stable. Seventy-one per cent of cases treated in Category 4 and 5 are those who have not been vaccinated, he said.




“The Home Isolation Policy implemented since October 8 has successfully reduced the pressure on bed capacity rate or bed occupancy rate in isolation centres. From the occupancy rate of 82 per cent, the rate has decreased to 78.7 per cent,” said the minister.




“The vaccination rate in the Sultanate has increased as projected and InsyaAllah, we will successfully achieve the target of 80 per cent of the population vaccinated as expected. The increase in vaccination rate is very slow however for those aged 80 and above.”




Minister of Home Affairs Pehin Orang Kaya Seri Kerna Dato Seri Setia (Dr) Haji Awang Abu Bakar bin Haji Apong and Minister at the Prime Minister’s Office and Minister of Finance and Economy II Dato Seri Setia Dr Awang Haji Mohd Amin Liew bin Abdullah also attended.

sneakpeek_bot,"&gt; # Singapore must strengthen revenue resilience to ensure no citizen is excluded from the benefits of growth: Lawrence Wong

&gt; SINGAPORE - The lives of Singaporeans and that of their children will become progressively better, and nobody - and no group - will stagnate or feel excluded from the benefits of growth, said Finance Minister Lawrence Wong on Friday (Oct 15).

&gt; Investments in these efforts to mitigate inequality and improve social mobility entail regular spending, and in order to cope with rising spending needs, Singapore will have to strengthen the resilience of its revenue base, he added.

&gt; ""We must continue to reduce inequality and promote greater social mobility among all segments of society and throughout their working lives... All these efforts will require more recurrent funding.

&gt; ""But these are areas that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will not hesitate to spend on - to invest in the progress and wellbeing of our people, to temper inequality and improve social mobility, and to counter the tendency for a mature society to stratify.

&gt; ""These are fundamental tenets of our commitment to Singaporeans.""

&gt; He gave this assurance to all Singaporeans, as he outlined Singapore's fiscal strategies and thinking behind them, at the 35th Singapore Economic Roundtable organised by the Institute of Policy Studies.

&gt; The roundtable gathers senior private sector economists, academics, business leaders and policy makers to discuss key macroeconomic policy issues facing Singapore.

&gt; Mr Wong said that Singapore has succeeded so far in running a prudent and effective fiscal policy. But the task at hand will only become harder, given three key challenges or ""curves"" that will determine the trajectory of the country's fiscal strategy.

&gt; These are: widening faultlines, and the threat to social cohesion when there is accumulated advantage by a small group of people; a rapidly ageing population, which means a shrinking labour force and an ever greater need for healthcare and aged care; and climate change - an existential challenge that calls for urgent action today, even if its worst effects will only be felt decades from now.

&gt; Like other countries, Singapore will need more fiscal resources to tackle these challenges of inequality, demographics and emissions effectively, he said.

&gt; The goal is to build a society that is even more fair and just - where every child can achieve his or her dreams and every worker can stand tall, and where every person can be accepted regardless of social background or age, race or religion.

&gt; ""But how can we ensure sufficient resources without placing an undue burden on our current or future generations? That is a question that keeps many Finance Ministers awake at night.

&gt; ""That means we must be alive to the immense responsibility the Government has as steward of our resources. What we have inherited from yesterday, we must wisely guard; what we have been entrusted with today, we must responsibly utilise.""

&gt; He pointed out that Singapore has made good progress on social mobility. A 2015 study by MOF found that of the children born from 1978 to 1982 to parents who were at the bottom one-fifth of the income stakes, 14.3 per cent moved to the top fifth among their peers in their 30s - higher than corresponding figures for other countries in Northern America and Europe.

&gt; This data was recently updated for children born from 1985 to 1989, and the percentage was 14 per cent - slightly lower than before, but still much better than many other places, he said.

&gt; He noted that it is not enough to tackle inequality through initiatives such as SkillsFuture, the progressive wage approach and top-ups to the Workfare Income Supplement scheme for lower-wage workers.

&gt; 

&gt; Singapore, too, is one of the fastest ageing societies, with one-quarter of Singaporeans projected to be 65 and above by 2030. This can place significant strain on society, he said.

&gt; The Republic's healthcare spending has already tripled in dollar terms over the past decade, and is now at 2.2 per cent of GDP. This expenditure is expected to increase further to 3 per cent of GDP by 2030.

&gt; ""I have said before that the revenue from the increase in GST will go towards supporting our healthcare expenditure. But this revenue will not be enough to cover the additional healthcare spending.

&gt; ""And we can expect healthcare spending to keep rising even beyond 2030, while the decline in the working age citizen population will shrink our income tax base. These are difficult problems, and there are no easy solutions.""

&gt; With shrinking labour force growth, productivity will be key, added Mr Wong. This means helping businesses to transform and shift away from manual processes, and equipping people with new skills.

&gt; It also means growing the silver economy, raising the retirement and re-employment ages, and providing wage top-ups and grants to incentivise companies to employ senior workers.

&gt; On the emissions curve, he said that Singapore is committed to this global effort, and is taking proactive steps to decarbonise its economy.

&gt; This will not be an easy transition because the country is at a double disadvantage - a lack of land space and natural resources which makes it very challenging to scale up renewable energy; and significant flood risks as a low-lying island.

&gt; But Singapore's economic story has always been one where it defied the odds, he said. ""So we are seriously considering the import of green electricity, and findings ways to overcome the high cost, and technical and security challenges.""

&gt; Singapore is also actively pursuing new opportunities to grow as a sustainable finance hub, and investing in R&amp;D on new technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture.

&gt; To arrive at a fairer, greener, and more inclusive society, Singapore must re-examine its fiscal strategies so that its tools can meet the tasks at hand, said Mr Wong.

&gt; It must ensure that its programmes and investments are funded in a fiscally efficient manner that preserves inter-generational equity.

&gt; Singapore has gone beyond just awarding grants to businesses, to using loans and equity to support companies. This will allow it to recycle its fiscal resources in the long run.

&gt; It also risk-shares with banks, and provides support or invests with private sector partners such as Clifford Capital and Heliconia.

&gt; ""In this way, we borrow their commercial lens in the selection of companies to groom into local champions. These expanded ways of investing in our economy and viable companies are crucial in stretching the public dollar,"" he added.

&gt; Singapore also strengthens inter-generational equity between the present and future, by making use of borrowing to finance long-term infrastructure projects.

&gt; The Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act, or SINGA, allows the Government to issue bonds to fund nationally significant infrastructure with high upfront costs but large long-term benefits.

&gt; Some think that borrowing will create more fiscal space, and so Singapore should borrow more.

&gt; But the Minister cautioned that borrowing is not a panacea to fiscal challenges, as what is borrowed today has to be paid back tomorrow, and borrowing simply shifts the burden to the future generation.

&gt; That is why Singapore is limiting its borrowing to long-term projects, where it makes sense to share the costs equitably between present and future generations, he explained.

&gt; ""We should never seek to make our own lives easier at the expense of future generations. That would not be responsible. Instead, we should always seek to pass on a Singapore in good shape to our future generations.

&gt; ""This has been a cornerstone of our fiscal philosophy since independence, and we will continue to uphold this.""

&gt; Strengthening revenue resilience is also crucial, he said, adding that compared to other countries, Singapore is in a strong fiscal position.

&gt; It has its reserves as an endowment, from which it draws a stream of resources to spend every year. Most advanced countries pay 2 to 3 per cent of GDP each year just to service their debts, he said.

&gt; In Singapore's case, its Net Investment Return Contributions (NIRC) give an additional revenue of around 3 per cent GDP on average, which has helped keep the overall tax burden low.

&gt; Some want Singapore to spend even more from its endowment.

&gt; But this idea should not be tossed about ""flippantly"", said Mr Wong, as returns from the NIRC already face significant headwinds in a more challenging global investment environment, and one must never underestimate the kinds of shocks that may plague Singapore in the future.

&gt; Just for Covid-19 alone, the Government has planned to use more than $50 billion from the reserves - more than 10 times the amount it had drawn for the 2009 global financial crisis, he added.

&gt; He concluded that Singapore's long-term outlook and prudence have put it in a stable place fiscally, and enabled it tostrengthen its social compact over the years.

&gt; In the end, he said, the country's fiscal system must sustain a more fair and just society.

&gt; ""This is our vision, and this is what our fiscal strategies have been built on. We will wisely steward our resources and never stop thinking about tomorrow, so we can have an ever fairer, greener, and more inclusive Singapore.""

oidoglr,"You didn’t include the rest of my sentence which said “through my CU”. I also stated previously that I do give the F&amp;I office a chance to offer a lower finance rate. 

If the dealer says I can get a lower purchase price on the car if I finance through them then it’s a simple calculation of the difference in interest rate between what my CU is offering and the dealer finance to look at the total difference. Not that big of a deal when you’re negotiating from home outside the pressure of a sales office. 

For example, when I bought a new car the option was an option to finance at 0% or take $5k off the MSRP (end of the MY a few years ago before the current car market obviously) so it was $25k @ my CU’s 3.5% or VW credit’s $30k at 0%. Taking the dealer financing over a 6 year loan term I would have paid $2,246 more for the car even at 0%

I have only bought one new car though (I get bored with cars pretty quickly - 2.5 years is the longest I’ve owned any one so I at least buy them past their initial depreciation curve) - so my advice is more specific to used cars that tend not to have the same promotional offers from the manufacturer to move new product.",2021-10-16 00:51:18

start100000,"The first US-listed bitcoin exchange traded funds are on the verge of launching next week with the deadline for an objection from America’s top securities regulator fast approaching.  
According to people familiar with the matter, the ETFs are likely to be given a green light by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, marking the culmination of an eight-year battle to win approval.  
ProShares Bitcoin Strategy would be the first ETF to launch, probably on Tuesday, when the 75-day period during which the SEC could object will have expired. A day later, the Invesco Bitcoin Strategy ETF, would also be allowed to launch unless the regulator blocks it.  
ProShares and Invesco declined to comment. The SEC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  
The likely approvals could open the floodgates to a stream of similar products, potentially fuelling a further leg up in the price of the cryptocurrency, which was trading 4.8 per cent higher on Friday at a shade under $60,000 on the Coinbase exchange.  
All the ETFs will be based on bitcoin futures contracts, rather than the spot price, with the SEC known to be concerned about a potential lack of liquidity and the risk of price manipulation on spot exchanges.  
It is still possible that the ETFs hit a roadblock, with the SEC having until midnight on Monday to raise objections to ProShares’ vehicle.  
As recently as last week Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC, described crypto finance as the “Wild West or the old world of ‘buyer beware’ that existed before securities laws were enacted”, adding that it is “rife with fraud, scams and abuse”.  
However, Gensler has hinted that he is more comfortable with trading on regulated futures venues such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  
Overnight the SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy tweeted: “Before investing in a fund that holds bitcoin futures contracts, make sure you carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits.”  
The likely approvals come eight years after entrepreneurs and Olympic rowers the Winklevoss twins applied to launch the first bitcoin ETF in the US, at a time when bitcoin was trading nearer $1,000.  
A swath of proposed funds has bitten the dust since, with the US having been overtaken by jurisdictions such as Sweden, Switzerland, Jersey, Germany and Canada that have permitted crypto exchange traded products.  
Almost 50 crypto ETPs are now up and running worldwide with combined assets of $14bn, according to data from TrackInsight. This includes 16 bitcoin ETPs, including inverse vehicles, which rise in price when bitcoin falls and vice versa.  
US investors have had access to private trusts such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, however, which has grown to $37bn in assets since launching in 2013, indicating the appetite for the cryptocurrency in the US.  
Weekly net flows into dedicated cryptocurrency funds as a whole hit a four-year high of more than $2.5bn earlier this month, according to data provider EPFR.  
While the SEC believes bitcoin futures are more appropriate for retail investors than trading in the underlying spot market, they are unlikely to deliver the same returns.  
The bitcoin futures market typically, though not always, trades with a modestly upward sloping curve, known as contango. This means that, more often than not, a fund will incur a loss when it rolls the front-month contract into a longer-dated one.  
Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Invest, which has filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, estimated the cost of this roll yield at 5 to 10 per cent a year.  
Dave Abner, global head of business development of Gemini, a crypto exchange, said that “while bitcoin futures ETFs are said to offer more protections for investors, this approach could unfortunately create another set of returns that don’t equal reality for investors seeking investment exposure to bitcoin”.

29187765432569864,"Imagine going straight from high school into med school. In many countries if you can get accepted into med school you enter it directly from high school, so you are not burnt out, and worn out by 4 years of meaningless college.  And you are not in debt for those 4 years.  The USA “education” system is set up to be elitist and to weed people out.  In many other countries their system is set up to reward and to advance smart people, as opposed to restrict the people who don’t have the means to spend thousands of dollars for 4 years of undergraduate school before spending even more money for more years.  The USA higher education system is set up to be keep people from easily advancing in life. The system basically discriminates against poor people. The system could easily be changed over night but the politicians and leaders don’t talk about that.  I know many great doctors from other countries and none of those doctors had to attend 4 years of college prior to med school.  And get this, in many countries if you do choose to go to college then the government PAYS for your college.  So in those countries instead of the system making it very hard to advance in life, the system is designed to make it easy to advance. Just imagine not needing to know anything from 4 years of undergraduate college in order to be a good doctor.  
Our system discriminates against people who don’t have enough money to go to college, and then once you are in college it weeds you out further. Many professors grade tests and papers on a curve so even though you earn a 90 on test, your grade gets curved down.  Some courses will only permit a certain number of students to have an A, so they curve people’s grades down until that magical number is reached.  So imagine you spend tens of thousands of dollars to go to college, and you get all A’s on your tests, but due to the curve your grade becomes a B.  So at the end of your 4 years your gpa is a 3.25 instead of the 3.75 that you actually earned.  This is just another example of how the system makes it hard to advance.  Then years after you graduate and you apply for jobs, say with the government, you discover that many of the higher paying positions require a grade point of 3.5 in order to be considered, but due to those professors that curved down, you are ineligible for the higher paying positions, even though you are competent in the subject and  have relevant work experience.  Our system is designed to keep people down, not designed to facilitate their advancement in life.  If high schools wanted to facilitate their students careers they would teach critical thinking skills, interviewing skills, internet research nuances, ethics, personal finance, and organizational skills and specific trade skills and employment skills so you can get a good job out of high school without going to college.  For example auto mechanics, or computer engineering, or air conditioning repair, or construction or welding or veterinary technology, etc. 
But instead they teach foreign languages, algebra, biology, physics, chemistry, trigonometry, geometry, etc. I have not needed chemistry, algebra, physics, foreign languages etc. since graduating high school and if the need arises for any of these subjects I can use the internet to figure things out.  Basically most of high school now days is obsolete and meaningless in terms of academics BUT without great grades the door to college is closed.  So we make great grades in high school in order to get into a college that curves our GPA down.  Most of high school is not needed for anything due to being able to use the internet to answer questions.  Shakespeare is useless in life, it serves no purpose to teach it.  If I need to solve a math algebra question now days I can use the internet or an app, I certainly don’t need to do years of homework.   Most everything we are taught in high school is not necessary for us to learn, 50 years ago it served a purpose but now it is just a colossal waste of time.  So yea, you do what you are supposed to, you attend school, get good grades and it is actually meaninglessness unless you are willing to go massively into debt to go to college.  The academics of high school are meaningless, but it is useful for teenagers to learn self discipline, critical thinking skills, time management, interpersonal skills, and how to have good judgment.  Approximately 1/2 of high school graduates go to some kind of college and they go into debt in order to attend college. So we are setting up some of our smartest people to start their lives with massive debt that takes decades to pay off, and somehow this system is supposed to be good for our society.  The system is just massively messed up.  You have done nothing wrong, you are swimming against the current as are millions of other people.  You are not alone.",2021-10-16 11:45:01

I tried big tech companies like Google but I couldnt make it past the technical interviews, I simply dont have a background in computer science so it was very hard for me to catch up.

Defi yield farming made an average of 385% returns across the entire field last year. There is less risk associated with evaluating APR.

The_Wind_Cries,"Sure man.   


First off, I will say that Geist has risks that are non trivial.  So i'll start there.  


**RISKS / FLAGS:**

\-The dev/leadership team is anonymous. Meaning it's hard to get access to someone who actually is runing the project and knows how it works and where it is going for straight answers.  


\-The tokenomics are really challenging for early investors. Geist has a max suply of 1 billion, but as of today only \~24 million of those have been emitted. With \~2 million more being emitted each day. That's significant inflation of supply for a new platform. And while Geist has already become the biggest platform in FTM in terms of TVL (more on that later)... FTM defi is just not big enough yet to support buying pressure with that much inflation even on its biggest platform.  


\-That has led to the coin dropping its value at a dizzying rate. Everyone with a brain knew it was going to drop pretty hard like most farm/reward tokens do in their first weeks/months, but the rate at which Geist has dropped (and is still dropping) is pretty significant. Owing to a few factors (the tokenomics, but also whale activity which we will get to). It makes it really important for anyone getting into the project to have really realistic expectations of DCA/timing their moves and to have a good strategy in place so they don't APE in and get rekt.  


\-TMS is decreasing. Although the 12 billion TMS that Geist had in its first 1-3 days was not sustainable and was mostly driven by early hype, it's now at around 5.39 billion. If it holds there, great. But if it keeps going down? Then platform fees (which are the revenue engine that drives rewards and incentivizes folks to stake/lock their geist) will follow. Now Geist offers an important functionality to the FTM ecosystem in terms of lending/borrowing, but much of that activity is incentivized by geist rewards. So watching TMS is key.  


\-BTC rewards on the platform are not currently being distributed. Meanwhile ETH, FTM, DAI, USDT and USDC rewards are all working fine. Now the dev team has said this is an issue with the platform needing to accumulate a certain amount of BTC before it's distributed... and that BTC rewards will be distributed to lockers and stakers soon... but has been evasive on giving a timeline or explaining how much progress has been made to hit that point. Not a good look.  


\-Whales are actively using the platform in a way that makes them money, but punishes non-whale investors who are interested/passionate/keen on the project. There are two large whales in particular (with 500m+ on the platform) who dump all their Geist every few hours. Driving the price down hard in big jumps. This definitely has punished some folks who aped in to the platform in its first day or two, and turned off a lot of other retail investors who might otherwise have invested in what otherwise is a pretty interesting project.  


**OPPORTUNITIES / GOOD SIGNS:**  


With that important context out of the way, why I believe in the project.  


\-The multi-sig team is solid. Really solid.  


It includes:  


a) Michael Chen (Fantom Foundation)  
b) Eerie (SpookySwap co-founder)  
c) 0xngmi (co-founder DefiLlama)  
d) Aveen Hujiari (co-founder Geist)  
e) Charlie Watkins (Curve Finance)

Now it's unclear how involved in the day to day (if at all) these guys are, but their involvement at least as far as being the custodians of the Protocol is pretty darn good. It definitely suggests a layer of credibility that had to be there for the platform to establish TVL of 4+ billion in just two weeks.  


\-The platform has real utility. FTM needed a large scale borrowing/lending platform where it was easy and quick to loan crypto and borrow against it (if desired) and it shows in how much capital flowed into Geist from the jump. I use it myself even for things that have nothing to do with the $geist token itself, and several large whales are making use of it as well. It's sometimes fun to watch their wallets and see the moves they make.  


\-The platform has injected a ton of life and TVL into the FTM ecosystem. Despite only being two weeks old, it's far and away the [biggest FTM platform with 2.6b in TVL. Spooky is second place with 600m](https://twitter.com/Crypto_Judge1/status/1449926055041527815/photo/1). That says a lot right there. Geist brings a lot to the table in building the backbone for future DEFI growth for FTM.   


\-FTM rewards: the platform is on pace to unlock the highest tier of FTM rewards based on its TVL. In the meantime, Michael Chen himself promised (and delivered on the promise) to incentivize people to use it with his own FTM. That strikes me as a powerful endorsement (backed up by real money) from a major FTM figure.  


\-The revenue sharing model is legit. You earn real ETH, FTM, USDC, DAI, USDT right now for Geist that you have staked or locked. In addition to Geist. And right now combined it works out to about 6% / day of your total locked/staked amount made up of those coins. Most comes in Geist but the amount of eth and ftm you generate is still non trivial.   


\-APR has been pretty darn consistent for locked/staked rewards on the platform. Staking is still over 300% and has held up over time. On the locked Geist front,  tt started in the tens of thousands on day 1 of course, but it's still at 2350-2400% right now and was in that exact same range 24 hours ago. That rate of decay is really damn nice, although will it last long term? Uncertain. But it's holding up well so far.  


  


There are probably more things to add to either list. All in all, definitely not a project where at the moment it's easy (or even remotely right) to just say to someone ""YOU GOT TO INVEST IN GEIST. IT'S A NO BRAINER DUDE! TO THE MOON!""   


It's imperfect, and still in that awkward knife edge phase where we are all still waiting to see if it's truly going to be able to live up to all the hype and excitement it generated at launch or if it's just going to be bled dry by whales in the short term leaving regular folks who believed in the platform long term holding the bag in the end. But for the moment, I feel it's a project worth being cautiously optimistic about and carefully using/interacting with with a clear strategy in mind and open eyes about the risks.",2021-10-18 13:27:21

u-rkallio,"Hey, we seem to share a similar wish to slow the progression of the game!

&gt;	I prefer playing long Skyrim playthroughs. A long time it bothered me, that I become too powerful too soon, so when I found the {{Sykrim Skill Uncapper}} and an uncapper.ini for ordinator I set up skillgain to 4 times slower. Albeit this helped, I still tend to end up too powerful at some point. I would love to play the game without changing the difficulty midgame and with always some challenge to it. Any suggestions?

I used to have this exact setup.  It takes a lot of tweaking to get the progression between different skills right, because difficulty also effects how much skill xp you get in combat for some skills, but not for others.

Anyway, I moved to using {{Experience}}, with the {{Static Skill Leveling}} add on.  This way I still get to tweak the overall progression speed of my character, and I don’t need to micromanage skill usage (training alchemy/smithing/enchanting especially is a pain).

You’ll still end up becoming way too powerful in the late-game, that’s just because the Skyrim progression curve is so wack.  The game starts with you dealing damage in the 5-15 points per hit range, but that quickly grows to multiple hundreds.  There’s no way balancing encounters with that kind of power creep, because early game opponents with 30-60 health will always fall in a single hit, while late game NPCs with health pools in the hundreds or thousands will be damage sponges, especially on legendary difficulty.

One way to mitigate this is to avoid utilizing one or two of smithing/enchanting/alchemy, which will flatten the progression quite a bit.  There are also NPC stat rescaler patches on the nexus which reduce the disparity between weak and strong NPCs.  What you should be aiming for is a flatter damage progression curve for you as well as the NPCs.

&gt;	The third thing that bothers me is the gold. I love to find treasures, but when my treasury is stacked with gold, gems and jewelry without any desire to spend it, the motivation to find even more suffers a little. I found {{Honed Metal}} to be a pretty good gold sink for a while, but it also contradicts my hope to not become too powerfull too soon, you do not even have to invest perks in your blacksmith skill anymore. The master pickpocket perk in {{Ordinator}} which lets you spend 50k for a perk point is also a good gold sink, but also supports becoming too powerful. {{RE - Real Estate Continued}} allows me to spend large amounts of gold, but not without returning even larger amounts after time passes. I don’t want to pay taxes for my horse, properties or followers like suggested in {{Simple Taxes SE}}, somehow this just doesn’t fit in my Skyrim-conception. I give some of my followers a pay with {{Nether’s Follower Framework}}. Yet, even without brewing and selling potions I still end up with more gold then I can spend. Do you have any ideas where I could spend it? Is there any mod that lets me finance and support a mercenary army to fight the Thalmor, far from Skyrim? Or something that lets me build a castle, bit by bit, for hundred-of-thousands gold pieces? Sinfully expensive feasts to invite friends and impress the nobility? Thank you for any suggestions!

I never seem to have this problem with becoming too rich.  I use honed metal, and on most characters I don’t level up any of enchanting/smithing/alchemy at all.  Instead I spent my money buying new weapons/enchantments/potions/tempering services from merchants to survive the next dungeon crawl.  Playing on legendary, I find I’m always spending the gold I have on hand for any kind of edge I can get.  Make sure you’ve got equipment durability system installed as well, it makes the tempering service that honed metal offers a nice money sink.

Followers are a great gold sink.  I use NFF’s weekly payment feature to balance the help I get from having a follower.  Of course, having a follower, I end up also having to buy gear upgrades and potions for them as well.  Make sure you’ve got the SKSE plugin that makes followers respect the game’s difficulty setting, otherwise they just become damage sponges on higher difficulty levels, and you end up not needing to upgrade their equipment as much.",2021-10-19 05:20:24

thomgloams,"Oh I didn't mean to imply anything about Curve. I've used Curve for stable swaps a bunch. I had never used their pools until recently.  And I started with a stablecoin pool but exited once I realized that anything under idk, ~$1000 (?) isn't worth it because of fees incurred from approving, depositing, withdrawing, claiming etc. Which of course, (I'm an idiot I know) is how they can provide rewards. 
Nothing wrong with that.  But if ETH fees (to a much lesser extent FTM or MATIC fees) feel large to a person (like me) then LP probably isn't a good idea. 

Which is unfortunate since as more come into crypto, the rewards will go down but the fees will be the same. And ppl who want to explore DeFi and farming with $500 are just gonna lose money. 

Unless one has some real inside info on an IDO or a platform drop, some kind of edge, it doesn't seem worth it to expose yourself to the crypto you were holding already, + IL + reward volatility + needless expensive fees.
Am I wrong?  DeFi is not a game even tho it is the gamification of finance. You're not gonna turn $500 into $5000 unless you have a huge strategic advantage (many do I'm sure) or a giant bankroll to start with. 

Pls tell me I'm wrong tho! All that farming fun doesn't have to end, does it? Dang",2021-10-19 12:50:31
CatSE---ApeX---,"Hi!

I agree with your sentiment on execution risk, and hiw the team / collective skill-set is key. 

1) I would recommend TheKOOKreports more than excellent team walkthrough post. It was taken down from wsb by mods, reposted on his private sub and is linked by me from the AST subreddit. In short they have assembled a set of ace professionals from defense, finance and from competing companies a lot of engineering/ space operation personell. A substantial amount from Blue Origin. I have seen one leave, he was in charge of areanging the delayed ride-share on a Soyuz. The managment seems to me able to attract competent people and acts in a meritocratic manner as to who stays. So I’d pass the in-depth questions on the team to Kook who did the research. I’ll say something about Able though. He worked as engineer at cellular connectivity company Ericsson in my home country they are cellular technology pioneers. He then went on to lead a succesful satellite communications company which he sold fot ~1/2 Bn USD. This means he is a seasoned CEO in the SatCom industry who has made profits. He has seeded the company with his own funds, is on minimum wage and all his outcome from the enterprise lies with success and his priority voting rights shares. AST is his baby.
Looking into his partner choice / mutualistic spectrum sharing businessmodel / how he shys CapEx / how the designs are next level from tech and regulatory fit perspective I am nothing short of impressed.
He is shy and nervous in front of cameras. I am to. He gets a lot of criticism for it. In my country the US TV commercial salesman type CEO would not be taken seriously but in the US that is considered got rethoric skills. So his humble/shy tech geek apperance is something I like but others dread. He must be another person with cameras Off the deals he struck with world leading enterprises shows this: AT&amp;T, Vodafone Rakuten/Altiostar, Samsung and so on. 

I will also say something on Adriana. The 3Bn Cisneros fam. Invesat company she runs made their fortunes broadcasting from Space. She went to launch events as a teen. For a US Space Billionaire, they both live in Florida, there you have the real deal. She actually made her billions in space. 
Her saying sums her up: ”Results not promises”.

2)  Timeline was pushed 3 months on a Soyuz launch delay (the delay was the prinary Korean satellite CAS-500-2 not AST fault). And as Marshack put it, this is inherent to Space and that guy who vetted the tech said the remaining risks were timing risks of that sort. So they had this business update call after the move to Space-x Falcon Transporter was announced. In that call they outlined the timeline. It is largely in agreement with the original ip. No milestone is pushed more than these three months and timeline catches up in the end. I would feel more comfortable that holds true if we see launch agreements drop on the Bluebird 1-4  and Bluebitd 5-20 upcoming launches sometime in the next half year that would serve as additional catalysts. They were under NDA with Space-x since 2017, so things might be in the works without us knowing.

3) most my capital is in my real estate/ agriculture enterprise so that investing in hypergrowth is my inflation hedge, a diversfication of my investments. I today hold well over 40,000 common shares at a 8.5 cost base. Growth rate should slow near 2027/28 and I will likely scale down / diversify the investment by then following my Lassonde curve theory of share price trajectory as the constellation enters depletion phase. But I will also be older and likely keep some for the dividends. So I am long ASTS. IF and WHEN this starts a catalyst driven runup I plan to extract most of my cost base. That will be gradually in the 30-50 range. This way I plan to be able to handle the volatility better as the value increases, thinking all I originally invested is secured. My only two other holds on the stock market are ENLV and LAC. Before that I held one stock, MRNA, which I invested in at the start of the pandemic I have since sold. My philosophy here is to research a few select companies and hold them during their hypergrowth phase until they have executed. I am by far heaviest in ASTS beeing my highest conviction case. Such an all in hypergrowth / high risk portfolio only makes sense if I count my ”value” real estate investment as part of the total. If AST does not execute I will loose portfolio value, on the flip side if they execute it will have outsized gains.
I have made an Net Present Value sensitivity analysis on the ip Free Cash Flow. There is this chart you can google and find. Lets you evaluate the company on a partial success basis / high discount rate.

If I use a very low percentage of future cash flow, say 40%, as a proxy for a 60% failure risk or just a 49% partial successful execution. And I use a high discount rate, say 12%, then the company is still worth much more than current market cap. That NPV chart lets you do that valuation by your own percentages/rates.

And this is when asserting a value of 0 to 51% owned subsidiary Nanoavionics, with 90 missions flown and launching the GIoT 72 sat constellation of their own. And counting only cash flows up until 2030 and 0 revenue thereafter. The company is just severely undervalued. This is I think because as a first mover their actual risks are not well understood. Imo they are mostly timing risks, there will be a few launch delays (there usually are), some countries will most likely delay spectum / market access causing a delay in some of the cash flow. So there is that delay/timing risk. But it does not add up to 80-90% failure risk / cash fliw reduction where the company is now valued. It adds up to 20-30% as a proxy for delayed cash flows and when you do the DCF / NPV math on that you see it is an investment worth taking.

My first involvement in Northern Irish politics was helping my good friend Lady_Aya write the then LPNI party manifesto - followed by a hard fought campaign in the constituency of Derry and Tyrone North against the then First Minister and the leader of the Ulster Workers Party, in which the LPNI made gains compared to the pre-election polling despite one of the most impressive efforts by the UWP to win the seat.

Following the election I was asked to take the positions of AERA minister and later Finance minister by our former party leader, /u/ohprkl - I gladly accepted the former, and had to be convinced to take up the latter position. It’s a big workload and a significant responsibility to deliver a budget and I wasn’t sure whether I’d have the time to do so. Since then I’ve taken to my job and decided that if I were to do it, I would do it right. 

During the term I’ve passed two major pieces of legislation, spending a combined billion pounds in investments, subsidies, wages and grants. Other legislation submitted to the speakership or planned shall move another 900 million pounds as I attempt to ensure the major programmes included in this budget are carried out, and not just lines on a budget the people of Northern Ireland, and indeed, the United Kingdom, are asked to fund.

Cheann Comhairle, when I was writing this budget, I was constantly thinking about where I’ve come from. About my youth growing up in our rural countryside, as a working class, LGBTQ+ woman in a catholic and too often not accepting environment. As a child they underestimated me. As a teenager, they discriminated against me. As a university student, my working class background meant that I was never truly accepted.

And yet, Cheann Comhairle, here I stand. No doubt, these are experiences that many fellow Catholics in this country have shared, but still ones that have shaped me. Shaped my views on society, on politics and on economics. And these views have shaped the budget that the Executive has introduced to this Assembly today.

That means this budget is unapologetically in favour of the interests of rural Northern Ireland, unapologetically social democratic and strongly in favour of greater social mobility, redistribution of wealth and economic development. Whether the Ulster Unionists or the Alliance Party can support this budget based on their own views is neither here nor there. Of course more support is preferable - but whether my budget holds up to their expectations of what a good budget should be is not my business. I am proud of the work I have delivered, and the policies laid out in the budget.


Now, let us get to those policies. The first of these may have taken the collapse of an executive, but Northern Ireland shall be raising the Corporation Tax rate to the minimum level proposed by the President of the United States, noted Irish Catholic Joseph R. Biden. In raising the rate to 15%, we are also raising over 100 million extra in tax revenues. This extra revenue helps Northern Ireland run a significant surplus for the next few years, even after the public minimum wage comes into full effect.

This budget cuts the rate of Land Value Tax levied in Northern Ireland from 1.5% to 0.75%. To some, this doesn’t sound like a lot. Less than a pence to the pound - but this saves hundreds of thousands of people in NI hundreds of pounds per year. This especially benefits farmers in this country, who today pay an effective 33% tax on their income due to LVT - making them the most heavily taxed people in this country. This budget will cut that tax in half and ensure our agricultural industry stands stronger than before.

I’m proud that this budget includes a fund for Water Management under the AERA budget, which also includes the fund for flood protection into the total. This fund shall not only be used for making Northern Ireland’s rivers, lakes and seas cleaner than they are now, but it shall also be used for rewilding projects along our rivers, the creation of new lakes along them, allowing our rivers to run more naturally and giving them the room to do so. The fund will also work in tandem with the tree planting programme to create a greater delay between when rain falls and the water reaches the river itself - flattening the curve and limiting the intensity and frequency of catastrophic failures of flood defense infrastructure.

The increase in NIEA will allow the current agency to improve its staffing levels. Today, they are still too low for the agency to do its job properly, leading to damage to our natural environments and events like the fish kills earlier this year. Ensuring we protect our nature and our biodiversity is a duty we have, not only to future generations or along religious lines, but also to ourselves, so all of us can continue to enjoy the beautiful nature of the country we live in.

The increase in subsidies to Libraries NI has been lowered by £90 million after an investigation with the help of /u/phyrik2222 into the use of this spending has found that this would quadruple the funding to all Libraries in Northern Ireland, a level of spending we considered inappropriate for the goals laid out by the previous budget. However, this does not mean that the executive does not support the work of our archivists, historians and researchers - 10 million of the PRONI fund has been made an annualised spending commitment to enable a digitalisation offensive to ensure more and more of the items and documents held at the archive are digitalised and thus more easily accessible to researchers, who will also be eligible for funding and assistance through the PRONI’s new fund for historians and researchers using the archive for their research projects.
The newly established rural culture fund will help protect the arts in rural parts of Northern Ireland flourish, with the possibility for writers, poets and artists using all kinds of languages and techniques to practice their work in our towns and villages. It allows for small local museums to continue their operations and maybe even expand. The Fishing museum of Northern Ireland will give our maritime and fluvial cultures the recognition they deserve, as well as create jobs for the direct area it shall be placed in.

The Apprenticeship Wage Subsidy included in this budget means that apprentices in Northern Ireland will finally be able to get a proper living wage, whilst still being competitive on the market with already qualified workers in their fields. This will transform lives, with apprentices now being paid over £10,000 more on an annual basis for their work and thus able to live happy, fulfilling lives off their work, rather than struggling to get by. The subsidy will ensure women and disabled people are more competitive on this market as well, giving the former more chance to find employment despite sexist attitudes and thus slowly normalise women working in these fields. This also means that disabled people are able to find fulfilling, well-paid work where they learn a valuable skill and thus are able to compete in the labour market.

Whilst the revaluations in the Education department do mean a net decrease in spending in the department, the spending is being used more effectively. The implementation of free tutoring means that all students in Northern Ireland are able to get the support they need to succeed, regardless of their (parents) financial means. The Rural Schools fund means that we can ensure our primary and secondary schools in rural areas can stay open and make the costs necessary to run at their best quality - whether that be additional teachers, new technology or new books.

To stop our brain drain to the rest of the United Kingdom and the Republic, it is vital that we invest in free tuition for students here, to incentivise Northern Irish students to stay here rather than move elsewhere for education and likely, stay there. Indeed, the fact that tuition is free in Northern Ireland for everyone, not just students from Northern Ireland, means that we could see an opposite effect - more students from Scotland, Wales and England moving here for education. If we want to build a strong economy into the future, this is an investment we have to make.

And this Executive is delivering more for rural infrastructure than just schools. We’re also investing in expanding rural healthcare services - from hospitals, to eldercare, gender identity clinics, ambulance services and more GPs. One part of this rural healthcare plan means offering higher wages for GPs in rural areas, so they continue to work in their communities and be the one of the central figures in those towns and villages again.

This Executive will abolish fares on our public transport systems. In doing so, we will not only take away a major cost in the lives of many people living in Northern Ireland today, it will form a major part of our strategy to take on climate change. Public transport shall always be the cheapest form of transport available to people here, and thus preferable to the car, especially in urban areas. To compensate for the increased demand expected due to public transport becoming free to use, we are allocating extra funds to Translink for the purpose of increasing capacity on existing transport systems.

Furthermore, this Executive is investing in expanding Northern Ireland’s rural bus network by thousands of miles, running hundreds more buses all across the country along many lines ranging from Derry to Newry and Fermanagh to the Causeway Coast. We will aim to have these buses be electric ones where feasible, but due to the large distances traveled it may be necessary to use conventional buses along some lines. Bus stops along these lines will be built to be accessible to all, with locations to shelter from the rain, park your bicycles and proper lighting for the early and late hours of the day.

I am not a senior; just a 2021 non-dropper JEEtard so my advice is a bit less relevant than some Dropper but I have a lot of time and nothing to do and hence here goes nothing.

Anyways-

1. As a dropper with not a great grip on Mains level stuff, you might be a disadvantaged with Mains. Trichy is a great college and if you put in some honest effort and utilise the home state quota, I am sure you can even get Trichy CSE. Just follow the conventional wisdom which I need to bore you with.  Still, I am not a dropper so I cannot comment on the viability of you doing great in adv.
2. Imo if finance isn't an issue, go for classes. Sure they might not give you the attention they give toppers, but any attention is better than none at all. The peer group and schedule are the most important things a class provides imo. Had it not been for the company of my friends, I would have slacked off faster than you can blink. (Pro tip- Try your best to get into some exclusive batch if possible as it just changes the slope of your learning curve dramatically) So even though it is a long distance to travel everyday, it is worth it imo.",2021-10-21 03:35:16

Urshilikai,"Joining late, shouting into the void what's been on my mind since 2015. Coincidentally when I went bearish on the stock market and lost an astounding amount of money--I'm biased that the fed cost me this 6 figure sum but will absolutely eat this loss if it was somehow for the utilitarian good. However I believe that fed policy since 2015 (and well before that) has not been for the greater good.

What is the official federal mandate: presently it is ""price"" stability and minimizing unemployment. Though I'm not seeing how current fed policy is enabling these goals at the present moment, given that inflation is correlated with future reduction in GDP and higher inequality (Gini coefficient) \[[https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.295.848&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.295.848&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf)\]. Nor do I think that ""reduce unemployment"" is actually a noble goal, given the material conditions of US capitalism where the vast majority of jobs are necessarily exploitative AND the implied effect of workers having less bargaining power via wage stagnation through permanently low unemployment. These goals instead bolster the status quo, reduce likelihood of social unrest, and empower the owners of financial capital.

The fed was formed in 1913 in response to a series of bank runs in which the fed would backstop all deposits of private banks--an actual noble goal to protect people from the excesses of capitalism. Note the absence of the dual mandate that is cited today, which was only formalized in the 1970s in response the inflation of the 60s-70s \[[https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.295.848&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.295.848&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf)\]. Coincidentally, this was a time when the value productive labor of the middle class decoupled from their earnings--there were many changes occurring during this period and I don't argue this is the sole cause but a likely contributor and an indicator of things to come. 

Jumping back to the present, what is the fed attempting to materially accomplish with its policy? I believe that the fed is, in a very real sense, living up to its compositional makeup: an unelected quasi-governmental organization with a revolving door to private financial institutions (Goldman Sachs) among the senior management: I imply that it attempts to straddle goals involving maintaining the status quo of the government (duopoly stability) to the benefit of financial systemic power. Viewed through this lens, what do low interest rates, the bond purchase program, exploding overnight repo, and novel collaboration with the US treasury accomplish? 

The low interest rates have been a hallmark of the fed since the identification of the Phillips curve which is an inverse relationship between WAGE inflation and unemployment. Right off the bat the assumption that PRICE inflation = WAGE inflation is only weakly supported (pointing straight at the flat line of inflation-adjusted wages since 1970, not even getting into the subject of shadow inflation stats that include things like housing/healthcare/education in the proportion that they are consumed). 

Low interest rates incentivize taking on debt at increasingly poor rates of return (often for 30 year duration). This is why it's often termed as ""pulling future consumption to the present"". Unless that investment has expressly forward-looking anti-externality intentions, it will be used to satisfy present vices. For consumers this includes things like houses, cars, credit cards. For banks its the same thing, but they can front run you--and profit from fees along the way. That's not entirely true, since banks can use debt in a variety of other creative ways in order to satisfy the ""multiple"" that all undergraduate economists are taught is king. A large fraction of this institutional debt-fueled speculation goes into bonds and stocks, but does so quasi-indiscriminately (or not so indiscriminately in the case of pump and dumps or debt-supported share buybacks). This is an oversimplification (though I don't pretend to know the vast networks and web-like avenues through which private capital can presently subvert utilitarian good--neither do I believe that even those in power do). The end result, that I hope most people can grasp intuitively, is that people and private companies have been forced to borrow cheap debt in order to stay afloat. Who wins when the bill comes due? This is the long game that I think the financial elite are playing at: benefiting from wage slavery on the way up, and hoping to benefit from the debt slavery on the way down. Cheap debt (and the trend of even cheaper future debt) creates perverse incentive structures to knowingly borrow as much as you can today assuming that you can borrow even more tomorrow. I disagree with this incentive structure at every level, and with the outcomes it produces--it benefits the riskiest gamblers to the detriment of savers. I don't believe that infinite risk tolerance should be rewarded. 

The bond purchase program is where things really started to decouple for me. I don't know if it existed prior to the covid era, but that's when it seemed to take off. Rather than the fed manipulating the US government-issued interest rate (which is backstopped against default by the US monopoly on violence AKA the military) which sets the rock-bottom floor of rates upon which other debt is measured, they started buying corporate debt. This later exploded during the early part of the covid crash and quite literally saved vast swaths of industries (cruise lines I'm looking at you) from annihilation. I'm torn here, because this may have been an actual positive benefit of the fed to stop financial ruin in the span of 3 months during the original lockdown--granted it was an environment of their own creation after nonstop QE since 2009 where no company was incentivized to hold a rainy day fund. Given that backdrop, I actually think the response to covid was warranted--BUT IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN if we had in mind geological time-scale investment horizons leading up to it. Let's be real, the earth is finite. Finance and the fed must be forced to play by these rules. Bond buying sets a horrible precedent for direct action by the government/fed to prop up zombie companies. 

The overnight repo and US treasury collaboration further extend what I believe are extremely dangerous limits of fed power. The former is an inverse measure of financial institutions willingness to lend to each other. Banks typically will lend to each other overnight to cover withdrawals, under the assumption that not all banks have net withdrawals each day (i.e. a run on the entire banking system in which the fed should guarantee). The rate of lending between banks is determined by perceived risk of default. It should speak volumes that financial institutions are unwilling to lend to each other. Who has the hot potato? Lehman? Evergrande? The addition of the US treasury, headed by previous fed chairwoman Janet Yellen and underscoring the revolving door among financial institutions, only solidifies the picture in my mind that shit is fucked behind the scenes. And yet we aren't addressing the root causes of this instability which is leveraged debt beyond comprehension (quadrillions, orders of magnitude larger than world GDP via derivatives contracts).

One could interpret the theme of this post as consistent with the feds most recent stated goal of long-running average 2% inflation since at its surface appears to be a fairly reasonable amount of inflation for those who took on unproductive debt without harming savers. While this is obviously bullshit in practice today given the real inflation in the past year has been in the neighborhood of 15%. Even if its ""transitory"" we should be gunning for no inflation for nearly a decade based on the last year alone (throw in real inflation since the 90s and the fed should keep the dollar flat for a century per their stated goal...). I'm not aware of any material the fed publishes that corroborates their models or predictions from which they derive policy, and so I can only come to the conclusion that this is BS. The number is fake, the goals are fake, the methods are increasingly fake. However I actually like this \~1-2% number which is the apparent inflation-adjusted growth of productivity. And that's important to account for if the goal of a currency is to keep pace with real economic efficiency. However I don't trust an institution to manage this, and instead we should be dismantling the the government and private systems of power that could even conceive of controlling such a number. We should also be simplifying and dismantling the complexity of the financial system (e.g. mortgages cannot be repackaged and sold to the greater idiot at 10x leverage because neither derivatives nor leverage should exist). If Wall Street wants liquidity,force them to trade in the direct commodities themselves and nothing else. Also decommodify necessities.

Feels good to put this out there after 7 years of insanity, even if my take ends up being dogshit.",2021-10-21 14:51:14
Greenmachine881,"\&gt;I haven't read Mosler's proposal. Got a link?

[https://www.huffpost.com/entry/proposals-for-the-banking\_b\_432105](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/proposals-for-the-banking_b_432105) 

\&gt;I suspect that it's mostly about making the system formally what it is in real life and making it clear to all parties (elected reps, appointed boards, etc.) what their roles and authorities are.

No, it's hard core interest rate, money creation, banking regulation.  Note that he assumes in the reader a detailed and expansive knowledge of the fixed income financial markets and govt finance.  A concise statement such as ""banks cannot sell loans"" have sweeping implications - with four words he wiped out Fannie Mae and all GSE backed bonds, which is $8T market today.  [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL404090405Q](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL404090405Q)

However he does leave out some important things: What about the corporate bond market? You need a bank for money creation to underwrite the bond, is that ""selling"" a loan? So you start carving out a lot of exceptions.  What about brokerage margin? etc etc.

It's definitely radical, I'll give him that.  I think one key realization is that in this zero short rate environment, banks will end up paying zero on deposits and will have no risk of losing those deposits (fed covers them unlimited) or having short rates rise and inverting the yield curve - every bankers waking nightmare.  So in banking parlance, zero interest rate risk, zero funding risk.  Bankers do one thing and one thing only: Analyze credit, and then eat their own dogfood.

\&gt;The dollar is already a computer entry at the Fed backed by absolutely zilch. 

Yes and no.  Dollars are computer entries at the sum of all financial institutions worldwide, and they are backed by debt.  Some of that debt is US govt debt (but not all there are plenty corporate and household debt) and the US govt portion of that debt is backed by zilch.  The non-govt portion is backed by land, buildings, corporate assets.  A distinction of this difference is that US govt makes coupon payments to non-govt entities and for them that is ""real money"" in the sense of profits, dividends, paying staff, buying fancy buildings.

\&gt; Backed by X, would means that it can be exchanged for X. It can't be exchanged for anything but itself.

Today it can be exchanged for debt securities and vice versa pretty easily, You have a fed note in your hand, you stand on a street corner waive it in the air, someone drives by and hands you a piece of paper signed by secretary of the treasury tilted ""Bond indenture agreement"", you take that and give up the dollar bill - you've exchanged it for something and vice versa.  Both paper are meaningless promises backed by nothing but the financial terms are very different (one carries coupon).  Because of that their relative exchange values fluctuate.

jbrev01,"I'm not going to go over the risks in crypto. There are many. You can research yourself on how to stay sufficiently safe. As far as defi projects going bust or beings scams, stick to the big names, popular defi projects with large TVL (total value locked). My advice to stay safe in terms of crypto security are to only and always use a hardware wallet. Always keep control of your own crypto, don't leave it sitting in an exchange wallet or wallet that you don't control the private keys. Again, USE A HARDWARE WALLET ONLY. I've seen way too many people losing their crypto in defi from using browser wallets only.

There is a chance that some stablecoins will go to zero. DAI is a decentralized stablecoin that has proven itself in big market crashes (somewhat). I hear UST Terra is another decentralized algorithmic stablecoin that is better than DAI, but the only project that offers it is I think Uniswap, but I'm doing everything on Polygon at the moment. USDT Tether is high risk as the company that issues tether is not transparent and has never allowed an audit of their finances. There are also rumors that if Evergrande defaults on their debts, this can cause tether to collapse (which would be very, very bad for all of crypto, and the worldwide economy). USDC is probably the safest stablecoin as it is audited and somewhat transparent. So Curve finance has a stablecoin pool that is split between USDC, USDT and DAI, that's a way to hedge your bets. But again, I'm staying far away from tether. All of my stablecoins are in USDC as I'm confident the circle that issues them (Circle) won't go bust.

I actually only keep very little in stablecoins, only a few months living expenses as I am not confident at all in government fiat currencies like the US Dollar. They are losing their value quickly and it is only going to accelerate. The governments and central banks think they can manage and control this, but history and logic says otherwise.

I currently keep most of my wealth stored in crypto and silver. So most of my defi pools are in crypto, not stablecoins. Mainly ETH at the moment.",2021-10-23 19:43:58

mia6ix,"I’m with you on everything, except the enormous and unnecessary leap you’re making to imply that the Wu-Tang album will be fractionalized as an NFT dividend for GME shareholders. I’ve been seeing this logical leap all over all the GME subs today, like apes are going to own a piece of this album, and it makes no sense. If you entirely remove that from your argument, your argument is much improved. 

For instance, change this one sentence: 

“Fractionalized NFTs mean they can break the asset (the priceless album)…” to “Fractionalized NFTs mean they can break the asset (the GME NFT dividend)…” and you have a great argument. 

There is literally no need for this specific album to be the asset that becomes the GME NFT dividend. Any NFT can be fractionalized, or a series of NFTs exactly matching the number of official shares could be created, and both of these would be just as impossible for broker/dealers to acquire for counterfeit shares. 

What the Wu-Tang and PleasrDAO situation reveals to us is

1. Ryan Cohen is almost certainly the hooded person in the PleasrDAO photo. 

(See https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qe2h3w/please_flick_through_pictures_and_connect_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)


This tells us he’s WAY ahead of the curve in bleeding-edge blockchain applications, which lets us know that a crypto/NFT dividend, or an entirely blockchain-based stock market, is something on his radar and totally within his wheelhouse. It validates what we’ve learned about the GameStop NFT project, the collaboration with Loopring, and GMERICA. It lends support to the idea that GMERICA will be or is already a DAO. 

2. PleasrDAO members appear to be aware of the unfolding situation with GameStop. 

(See https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qdsr4r/the_nft_which_will_hit_the_scene_like_a_bomb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf )

The references in the media interview with pplpleasr and the references to apes on their site indicate this. This is seriously bullish for us. If you haven’t checked out the PleasrDAO membership, it’s a who’s who of crypto innovators. https://pleasr.org/

The reason I do not think that the Wu-Tang album itself is related to GameStop is because this album is owned by PleasrDAO, not by Ryan Cohen. PleasrDAO has 74 members who now own this album together, and many of them are BFDs in DeFi (decentralized finance). There is no reason to assume that these stakeholders in this valuable asset are going to break up this asset to deliver fractionalized “shares” of it specifically to GameStop stockholders. That’s the huge leap I’m talking about. It makes no sense. PleasrDAO owns a lot of valuable NFTs. Their mission statement is about decentralized, community ownership of digital art. 

The connection we should be making is that RC’s involvement with PleasrDAO is evidence that he knows *exactly* how to leverage DAO concepts and fractionalized NFTs to potentially revolutionize the stock market as we know it - and he will perhaps do that in exactly the way you’ve described (minus the part about distributing a priceless album as a fractionalized NFT).  

Any NFT dividend issued by GameStop will *become* priceless the very second broker-dealers realize they can’t fulfill their legal obligation to provide said dividend to all the clients who have GME in their portfolios.",2021-10-24 04:26:08

5. The maximum wallet size shall be 0.95% of the total supply, or 9.5 million tokens. This means, no single wallet will control even 1% of the total supply. Greater distribution means that we can ensure that this will be one of the most decentralized projects in the Cryptosphere.
6.total supply 1,000,000,000 coins with 50% burned at launch.
7. Boost has taken elements from Uniswap, SushiSwap, ParaSwap, Bancor, Balancer, Dodo Exchange, and Curve Finance to create a full-functioning backend. They have added advanced functions, such as a Limit order function, which will enable users to set a predetermined price at which they are willing to execute a swap. In future iterations, they will also be infusing features that can only be accessed by Boost Coin holders and some subscription based features requiring Boost Coin exclusively as payment.
BoostSwap will have a 0.3% swap fee which will be directly contributed to the Boost Coin liquidity pool, thus increasing the value of Boost Coin with every transaction performed on BoostSwap, regardless of which tokens or coins are exchanged.
Also they will be establishing numerous partnerships with new projects being launched on the Ethereum network. These partnerships will be both revenue generating and provide additional marketing and outreach. The revenue will also be added to the liquidity pool of Boost coin, further increasing its value.

1to14to4,"You can read the CBO report on this.

https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56910

While the outlook is bad, the issue isn't raising interest rates right now. It's going to happen and there is no stopping it. The 10 year will rise on its own as the yield curve steepens. 

But the fact is the issue isn't rising interest rates right now and the Fed raising rates. We will come back almost in line with servicing costs relative to GDP according to the CBO. The issue is the long-term spending projections and expansion of the debt. As the final bullet point on the presentations say.

&gt;Growth of Net Interest Outlays. In CBO’s most recent projections, the cumulative deficit from 2021 through 2030 totals nearly $13 trillion. Borrowing to finance that deficit—at a time when interest rates are expected to rise—would cause net interest payments as a percentage of GDP to increase over that period, from 1.4 percent to 2.2 percent, which is generally in line with the 50-year average of 2.0 percent. Over the long term, interest rates are projected to rise further, and the amount of debt issued is projected to grow, causing net outlays for interest to increase to about 8 percent of GDP by 2050.

So no - no one with knowledge of these projections thinks that rising interest rates right now would have a ""threat""ening effect to the stability of the economy. Or else you'd have no one arguing for it - and there are plenty of people arguing for raising rates.

Edit: that doesn't mean there isn't some political tilt here. Some people (and possibly Powell) want to keep rates low to fund the current spending package, which probably will be funding over time through a wide variety of different duration bonds. But that also doesn't mean rising interest rates is unstabalizing... just dangerous because it leads to the debt growing faster.",2021-10-24 13:59:36
RimkeV,"Mentioned mine a few times before but...

Rewards from bank accounts - Halifax and Barclays. Got Lloyds too but it's not monetary.
£8 a month. (Double this as partner does same)

Only surveys I do is on Premise, started this month and only surveys I can stand, should easily pass £10. (Double again for partner)

Serpclix - Roughly £10 a month give or take but due to work, lots of times when not at my computer, it's easy enough to do though. (Partner does around the same)

Use to do AMEX/Nectar/Tesco points, if spending big I'll still use AMEX. Jump on any spend promos, where possible shop via BA Shopping Portal, insure my fake cat for it to die for bonus points etc... weekly shop at Sainsbury's anyway so still collect points, would say I do around £10 a month.

Like I said above, use to do a lot on the cards but recently switched to Crypto.com card for the 2% cashback (in CRO) and Spotify, only started it the other week but spent lots of time on the sub and learning to get the most out of it.
Link it to a Curve card, then both you and your partner can use the same card, creating more cashback faster.
Annoyingly once you load up the card with money, apparently you can't withdraw the money off the card so yet again, use Curve, spend on a normal credit card via Curve and end of the month, add up what you've spent and get Curve to move it the CDC card once you've loaded up the correct amount.

If people don't fancy using crypto card and staking £300, Chase is offering 1% cashback for a year.

Just started holding stable coins for the high interest, expected £8 back this month from that, compound it and put back in for a month etc...
Looking at liquidity pools still.

Got 1 Helium miner that's on week 3 that's generated $112 so far.
Got 3 more helium miners to come.

My AWAIR monitor is coming for PlanetWatch.io that should hopefully bring in $2k a year but obviously coin price can fluctuate. May by more of these, we'll see.
Tempted to flip 2 of the Helium miners and get the Aquino Type 1 from PlanetWatch.

I work continental shifts, average around 13 days a month so if weather nice and not got much on, I'll jump on my bike and do a bit of Deliveroo/UberEats, anywhere between £100 - 150 a month, maybe a bit less this last month, don't mind the cold and rain but the wind is crippling at times 🤣

I basically use the beermoney offers to help finance ways of making more money.
Other day I went through and did all the invest/loan offers, for an investment of £35, I'll get that back minus/plus how the investment went plus £65 in referral money, should come end of Jan and start of Feb.

Next week I'll start on any crypto offers I've yet to do because I got lazy, think around 7 or 8, obviously some you have to hold for a while.

I'll then use my partner's info and refer her to them all with my referral so treble the returns of any offer.
Any MatchBetters with multiple accounts courtesy of family and friends can do this.

My advice, if you got a partner, get them on board or at least get their info and set it all up.

cherry-pick-me,"Thanks op for starting this! Thanks to everyone for sharing how they make money online!

If you are un undergrad (Uni student who doesn't necessarily study on the Uni's campus; eg distance/online learning), you can get free council tax depending on the number of credits and your local council rules.

For me, the most money I made referring through the Cash App until they closed my account. 

Now, I use Topcashback and Quidco whenever I can to get cashback (utilities, airport car park, ebay, mobile and broadband, home insurance etc)

I also try to cook more often, and be more mindful when shopping about what I need vs what I want (AKA stay away from impulse buying). I know this doesn't give you any money per se, but it can make a meaningful difference in the way you spend the money you have (which often is not a lot to start with!). 

Cutting down on unnecessary subscriptions or trials can also help! Say if you used to use your gym so many times per week, or watch Netflix so often in a week, but no longer have time for that due to current commitments, if can be sensible to simply cancel them if they no longer provide value for money to you.

I haven't tried matched betting, but it seems that you can make money like many have said and posted, and if you follow the rules properly. 

Another point is that some of these offers (bank switches, credit cards etc) can impact your credit history (in particular in the short term). While this may not matter, it can be detrimental if you are looking to secure a loan, car finance or mortgage in the near term (say next 12 months or so). 

And many offers seem to just lure customers with a dangling carrot, and then they are soon pulled out or the apps completely disappear, eg Emma, Cleo, Verse (due to Brexit), Curve (keep changing their referral terms) and on and on... Sometimes, it's not even worth to effort so yeah, I feel like it's quite difficult to make any decent money on a regular basis. Especially now, when the offers seem to have thinned out significantly due to Covid crisis and everything else...

As for survey offers, I personally don't have an inclination. I think Swagbucks simply has put me off from trying others.",2021-10-24 20:06:53
Whale_Poacher,"Capitalism does not need to be ruthless, anticompetitive, or existent as free market capitalism. Your analogy is full on mouth garbage. We’re all participants in capitalism, it’s not like saying whatever the fuck you’re saying. I don’t know what kind of approach you’re taking, but my expertise is in marxism and finance, what I’ve studied the most in school and have degrees in. You seem to lack knowledge on how funds for such things are raised and distributed for the building and maintaining of those buildings. They exist in a capitalist system and are maintained through taxation in a capitalist system. I don’t know if you’re proposing socialism instead, but I’d rather have high meat prices then bread lines and no opportunity to move in life. Capitalism proposes that others can make decisions about whether something is worth it to them and if enough decide alternatives to rising meat prices are a better opportunity they will seek them. Price fixing is a mechanism that involves colluding and acting in a way that hurts others and manipulates a supply and demand curve. Capitalism is not a zero sum game and your throwing big words at me as if I don’t understand the mechanics of capitalism isn’t really a proper response to why meat prices are being MANIPULATED beyond what equilibrium should be on a demand curve.",2021-10-25 01:34:00
handsomeboh,"There are lots of economic theories on personal finance. Chief among them is the Permanent Income Hypothesis as developed by Friedman in the 50s. It quite simply posits that the most efficient way to plan your expenditure is consumption smoothing. As long as you have the same diminishing marginal utility curve in each period, then the optimal strategy is always to split up your consumption equally in every period.

However, your income is not constant, and so you need to forecast your future earnings and consume the average of that in each period. In practice, that means you should consume more than you earn when you're younger by taking debt, and pay off that debt when you're older. We sort of do this already with car loans and mortgages, but it basically tells us that not being in debt is economically inefficient.

On top of this we can also stack theories on precautionary savings. This posits that your savings should be proportionate to your uncertainty. This means you should save less when uncertainty decreases, like when you buy insurance.

There's a whole field of study here that includes multiple other theories like intertemporal choice theory, and many facets of portfolio construction theory.",2021-10-25 07:56:11
Whawken84,"A billion dollars a year is return on an investment which wasn't originally created to make any profit other than having a better educated workers and citizens.

""If a degree isn't worth a $30,000 investment, why get one?""  My perspective, looking back to the public universities pre dating the 1862 Morrill Act (ex Mich. State U was founded 1855) is that public higher education should be accessible. 30Gs on a 22 year old's shoulders is a lot of money. Not everyone has supportive or money savvy parents / guardians. That debt can influence every decision made by this young adult. And many mistakes. We all make bad decisions. Often we make more not -so -great decisions when we're young &amp; less experienced. Many new grads get low paying jobs to start or unpaid ""internships"" (which I think are a cruel joke). 22 year olds often don't have a career mapped out. And today's good idea of a profession might be outdated quickly due to technological change. Repeating myself, most grads &amp; parents are not that well versed in finance. Parents may be working in jobs and school and are exhausted when they get home - being a health care worker was exhausting before COVID. The big debt discourages many potential students from applying for college. Graduates may go straight to grad school in order to manage that debt - or avoid immediately confronting it,  only to find that they hate their chosen field or are ill suited for it despite grades &amp; test scores.

I agree w/ you about the history of skyrocketing educational costs. IMO, it became a racket. 

IMO Parent Plus Loans are best for parents who don't really have a financial need for Parent Plus Loans or know their kid is the next Stephen Hawking, Cheryl Sandberg or (fill in the blank). Parents are often just finished with or are still paying their own student loans. Parents need to save for their own retirement. The kids  won't be able to support them as they, too will still be paying loans and the grandkids will be needing student loans before the lis are done with payment - making them The Sandwich Generation. .Since most pensions are a thing of the past and 401Ks / 403Bs, while portable, usually don't have the same financial benefit for the average middle class or working person. this adds more financial &amp; emotional stress. Too much temptation to take money out for life's necessities or emergencies beyond the emergency fund. Life throws us curve balls: catastrophic illness, natural disasters, unwanted unemployment.

Gravely_Chill,"Here is my own breakdown of all the courses I have taken or am currently taking and with which professor.  Enjoy!!!

BUSOBA 2321 (Dickstein) I’m in now and it is just annoying.  I did pretty bad on his exam, but there is a built in curve and, on top of that another curve that gets implemented if students do so bad.  Basically, the course material, weekly quizzes, and cases are easy, but the exams are just painful and confusing to study for.  They do not run on proctorio, however it still is terrible.

BUSOBA 2320 (Draper) was not as bad imo.  There was so much extra credit to take advantage of that you should be able to pull an A as long as you do it all.  The cases are more involved, but are super easy if you go to office hours.

BUSML 3250 (Norton) is the same deal as stats.  The exams are difficult, but in my case as long as you pull an 85 the curves and extra credit should take it up to an A.  

BUSML 3380 (Esper) was another annoying course.  There are so few points in the class that if you miss one quiz your grade can drop significantly.  I thought I did bad on the exam, but it turned out he curved it so much that I ended pulling an A.

BUSFIN 3220 (Clark) is mostly self paced as far as I’m concerned.  You have to do your due diligence and stay current with the material yourself.  The exams were average as far as difficulty, but you do have to really study for them.

BUSMHR 3200 (Buchanan) has difficult exams that are weighted heavily.  Just really study for them and stay current with the material.  The work outside the exams is super easy.

BUSFIN 3500 (Helmreich) I can’t really comment on yet since that course just started for me, however I heard this course isn’t too bad compared to the others.

BUSOBA 3230 (Lundregan) is more math heavy than I anticipated.  The required lectures and recitations force you to stay current with the material.  The math isn’t difficult, its just a different kind of math like finance and statistics.  So far, this class has been one of the most organized at fisher for me.

BUSMHR 2000 (Corredoira) was super easy.

I had transfer credit for the two accounting courses, but I hear I dodged a bullet with those.  If you have any questions let me know.",2021-10-26 09:28:02
TsotyliBoi,"Then, and I’ll elaborate, don’t do anything you don’t have a drive to do.

I wanted to be ahead of the curve so I’d ask this question. Everyone said the same thing, “enjoy your college time” One senior manager actually gave me something to do. He gave me a textbook to read to learn and understand real estate finance (bc thats what I wanted). Even with my drive and interest, I never got past page 10 lmao. Did it affect me in any way? Not one bit.

However I make the point of do what drives you because sometimes you genuinely *want* to do “professional” things in your free-time and you shouldn’t feel bad about that. I started a consulting firm my senior year cuz I was interested in it and the opportunity presented itself. That went on to be the most asked thing on my resume (I was even in the army lol) and what got me to land Deloitte, Amazon, and so on. So if you do in fact have a drive to do something related, then go for it cuz it’ll only help your chances of success. Not doing anything career-related, and simply chilling and enjoying college, will also help your chances of success. Just do you 🥸",2021-10-26 10:57:00

panzerpanda,Locking up curve tokens gives you voting power for curve gauges which can massively boost apr on the lps on curve. Average lock up is 3.5 years and 88% of circulating curve is currently locked. Supply shock is a thing since convex finance started incentivizing people to stake their crv with them and lock it up forever. Convex will soon own the curve  weight gauge vote by itself. Dyor on that dope ass protocol with its staking and bribing system for curve weight gauges by locking cvx tokens. It’s a lot more complicated but I’ve made a retard huge amount of money off of both. Plus ~60% apr on your staked cvxcrv and ~50-55% on locked cvx with bribes taken into account is fucking choice shit.,2021-10-26 22:41:14

That's a pretty decent tutorial for convex, getting into the Curve pools is a bit complicated but it's worth knowing how to do because the yields are so high. It's worth mentioning that this form of yield farming is a bit riskier than regular yield farming on PCS or whatever but so far there haven't been any real problems with impermanent loss and TVL has been consistently exploding since Convex launched.

This is a better explanation than I could give because I'm not very tech savvy. When you deposit into Curve LP's you have the option to lock up your LP token long term (4 years or so) in exchange for a drastically higher yield.

 So what Convex does is it takes your Curve LP token and locks it up in the Curve Guage for you and you get a Convex LP token in exchange. So now you're receiving boosted Curve rewards and also Convex finance rewards on your Convex LP token, which results in a significantly higher yield than simply using Curve. You can withdraw your assets from the Convex LP at any time, so you get the benefits of locking up your liquidity long term without actually having to lock it up for any time at all. It's great.

Also, you can stake Curve Dao token for 64 percent APR on Convex (comes out to around 80% APY by compounding like every other month). There are also BTC and ETH pegged pools that allow you to get a really solid yield on your BTC or ETH with a minimal risk of impermanent loss and you can't really find that anywhere else. Maybe Balancer but I'm not positive. Hope this helps.",2021-10-27 00:05:57
Sardonac,"Graduating isn't the goal, graduating with a degree that gives you a decent return on investment is.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if you end up not liking the fields that are super relevant to your field of engineering, engineering and similar STEM majors tend to be fairly robust academically, which gives you more options to find work in other fields. This is why you see engineers who end up working in finance, project management, whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

In your position I would consider going part time. If going part time and lowering your course load means that you do better but end up graduating a little later, that is a fair trade off and will build your self confidence. I would also keep in mind that engineering academics tends to be very front loaded in difficulty. There is a harsh initial learning curve that forces you to adapt to the workload. By the time you're in late sophomore/junior year you're more comfortable with your new 'normal' workload and can handle the stress a little better. Don't beat yourself up too much, you can definitely handle the engineering workload if you manage it at your pace.",2021-10-27 00:21:12

1. No lectures. Fairly big classes for tutorials. A lot of self study. Tutorials expect you to come having already read the material. 

2. Not sure about this. Exemptions werent allowed for me even though i entered from a related poly course.

3. Not sure but not easy i think. Bell curve has people getting 100s

4. GPA at the Uni stage? Would be important for masters and for work. Dont think masters is required as not many of my friends went on to do masters. I think its not good to be overqualified when you just start work too. Youd want some working exp under your belt to get a good lay. 

GPA likely affects your choice of exchange. Before covid, i think everyone was guaranteed a slot. But your GPA would affect your chances if other people applied for the same slot.

5. Self sourced but the school holds job fairs and stuff which help. There are also job counsellors... though they wont be helpful to actually help you get a job, they can at least guide you with the process of youre really lost

6. All degrees are honour degrees i believe. Automatic.

NoFrontiers,"A l'heure où le Livret A ne rapporte plus que 0,50 %, un courtier enregistré auprès de l'Autorité des marchés financiers lance un placement au « rendement garanti » de 5 %. Est-ce une réelle alternative aux livrets d'épargne classiques ?  
Un livret à 5 % : l'annonce du courtier en cryptomonnaies Coinhouse, enregistré auprès de l'Autorité des marchés financiers, a de quoi susciter la curiosité. A l'heure où le Livret A ne rapporte plus que 0,50 % , comment est-il possible de servir 10 fois plus aux investisseurs sur un livret d'épargne ? Si l'argent magique n'existe pas, les rendements magiques non plus. Un produit ayant stricto sensu les mêmes caractéristiques qu'un livret à savoir la liquidité, un rendement plutôt stable et un capital garanti ne peut pas servir un tel taux dans les conditions actuelles de marché.  
D'ailleurs, bien qu'il soit baptisé « Livret Crypto USDT », « ce n'est pas un livret d'épargne » de l'aveu même du directeur commercial de Coinhouse Romain Saguy. Première différence : il n'est que partiellement liquide. Alors que l'argent sur un Livret A est disponible à tout moment, les fonds confiés à Coinhouse sont bloqués durant les 13 premières semaines qui suivent la souscription. « A l'issue de ces 3 mois, le client peut sortir quand il le veut. Il recevra le rendement annuel au prorata de son temps d'investissement », explique Romain Saguy, directeur commercial de Coinhouse . En l'occurrence, un taux de 5 % annuel correspond à une rémunération de 1,25 % après 13 semaines.  
Capital non garanti  
Plus fondamental encore, le capital sur le livret de Coinhouse n'est pas couvert alors que les dépôts sur un livret bancaire classique sont protégés indépendamment du contexte économique ou de marché. Le courtier ne garantit pas à l'épargnant qu'il retrouve la totalité de l'argent déposé. Il s'engage seulement sur le versement des intérêts.  
Ce produit n'est donc pas dénué de risques, ce que n'occulte pas Coinhouse. Dans la fiche d'information accompagnant ce produit, le courtier évalue à 3 sur 7 le risque de ce placement, 1 signifiant pour Coinhouse que le risque est faible, 7 qu'il est très fort. Bien qu'elle reprenne les codes du SRRI, l'indice financier courant qui permet de mesurer le niveau de volatilité d'un placement (1), cette échelle de risque est propre à Coinhouse, fait remarquer Philippe Maupas, consultant financier et auteur du blog alphabetablog. Elle n'est ainsi pas comparable par exemple au SRRI d'un fonds immobilier, très souvent noté 3 sur 7. Il semble effectivement que les risques attachés à ce nouveau produit soient nettement plus élevés.  
3 Risque majeurs  
En l'occurrence, les risques du Livret Crypto USDT liés aux sous-jacents de ce placement sont au nombre de trois : contrepartie, piratage et change.  
Concrètement, pour générer 5 % de rendement, Coinhouse prête les cryptomonnaies de ses clients via les outils de finance décentralisée. En résumé, il s'agit de sortes de plateformes de crowdfunding en mode crypto, c'est-à-dire régies par un protocole informatique.  
« Cela fait 18 mois à 2 ans que la finance décentralisée existe, mais c'est complexe techniquement pour un investisseur seul. Certaines plateformes ne sont pas accessibles en dessous de 2 millions investis. Les taux sont variables d'un jour à l'autre, cela peut-être 8 % une journée, 4 % une autre. Il faut se montrer réactif et réallouer ses fonds vers d'autres plateformes si le rendement baisse », détaille Romain Saguy. C'est aussi cette volatilité forte qui fait que Coinhouse peut réviser tous les 3 mois le taux de son livret crypto.  
La finance décentralisée permet notamment à des crypto-investisseurs d'emprunter de la cryptomonnaie pour augmenter la quantité d'argent investi. C'est ce qui génère un effet de levier dans cet univers virtuel. Pour obtenir un prêt, ces investisseurs doivent mettre en collatéral la quantité suffisante de cryptomonnaies pour couvrir leurs éventuelles pertes et rembourser ainsi le prêteur, assure Romain Saguy.

Risques de contrepartie et de piratage  
Mais un risque de contrepartie existe bel et bien, reconnaît le directeur commercial de Coinhouse. « Si on fait une erreur de gestion et que notre investissement génère moins de 5 %, nous assumons la différence. En revanche, si le protocole sur lequel l'argent est placé fait défaut, ce n'est pas du ressort de Coinhouse. Nous minimisons ce risque en faisant appel à des plateformes de premier plan comme FTX qui vient de lever 100 millions de dollars », poursuit Romain Saguy. Sur les 16 supports d'investissement sélectionnés, Coinhouse passe aussi par des applications moins connues comme Curve et Aave.  
« Il y a un risque de fraude », met aussi en garde Philippe Maupas. « Depuis 3 à 6 mois, les affaires de hacking qui sortent dans la presse concernent essentiellement la finance décentralisée », fait également remarquer Mehdi Zouari, expert blockchain et crypto pour le groupe de conseillers en gestion de patrimoine Selexium. Ce dernier préconise aux investisseurs intéressés par la cryptomonnaie de s'exposer très progressivement.  
« Il faut commencer avec quelques centaines d'euros et ne surtout pas clôturer son Livret A destiné à accueillir l'épargne de précaution », explique Mehdi Zouari. S'agissant du placement de Coinhouse, « le ticket d'entrée de 50.000 dollars est très élevé. Ce produit est donc réservé à des investisseurs ayant une capacité d'épargne importante », souligne le porte-parole de Selexium. Coinhouse indique vouloir abaisser prochainement ce montant minimum d'investissement.  
Risque de change  
Enfin, un troisième risque existe : celui de change. En effet, les prêts aux crypto-investisseurs ne s'effectuent pas en euros, mais en stablecoins. Il s'agit d'une cryptomonnaie. Mais à la différence des plus connues, bitcoin et ether, la valeur d'un stablecoin est censée être stable dans le temps, équivalente à une monnaie comme l'euro ou le dollar. En l'occurrence, Coinhouse a choisi le stablecoin tether (USDT).  
Avantage : tant que l'investisseur ne convertit pas ses stablecoins en euros, aucune fiscalité ne s'applique. Inconvénient : comme le tether est indexé sur le dollar, l'investisseur qui mise sur le Livret Crypto USDT de Coinhouse s'expose aux évolutions de la parité euro-dollar. « Cela peut être à son détriment si le dollar s'affaiblit », met en garde Romain Saguy.  
En outre, si le tether est le stablecoin le plus courant, avec une capitalisation qui dépasse les 40 milliards de dollars, le mécanisme de garantie lui permettant de maintenir sa conversion en dollars pose question. Le 15 octobre dernier, le régulateur américain, le CFTC, l'a en effet condamné à payer 41 millions de dollars pour avoir menti sur ses réserves. Interrogé, le porte-parole de Coinhouse se veut rassurant : « le seul fait que Tether ait été mis à l'amende est un signe positif. Cela veut dire qu'ils ont soldé leur contentieux », explique Romain Saguy. Il ajoute néanmoins vouloir prochainement diversifier les stablecoins utilisés.

BraveNewDeFi,"There are several things you can do with your NXM.

1) If you're looking to sell and can't because the MCR% &lt;= 100%, then you scan wrap NXM to wNXM. There is a discount to the bonding curve price, and the discount is currently below book value. If you do want to sell, the deepest liquidity is on Bancor.

2) There aren't any sufficiently liquid lending/borrowing markets for wNXM at the moment. While there is a Rari Capital Fuse pool that Reflexer Finance has started, it's not a whitelisted pool yet, so it wouldn't be coverable by Nexus Mutual. I'm not sure how liquid that pool is, but feel free to look on Rari Capital's Fuse pools. 

3) The Nexus community is very aware of the wNXM discount issue. During our community call today, it was discussed extensively. You can see the current forum post on [Solving wNXM discount while maintaining reasonable MCR%](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/solving-wnxm-discount-while-maintaining-reasonable-mcr/683) on the Nexus Mutual forum. Our Investment Hub is also exploring a potential buyback, but there are considerations our community is reviewing before that can happen. 

While the MCR lock issue is very frustrating, the bonding curve is essential for controlling capitalisation levels so the mutual can ensure there's enough capital to payout claims should a loss event occur.

cinepro,"You just discovered the economic principle of complements and substitution. You would probably get a Nobel Prize for it, if it wasn't already in every Econ 101 textbook.

Because there are a massive number of suppliers for ""food"" and massive competition, there is great supply of ""food"" and prices stay low. Everyone needs ""food"", but not everyone needs ""broccoli"". They might be just as happy with cauliflower, or spinach, or peas. So if all the broccoli farmers increased prices together, people could buy less broccoli. 

You could argue the same is true for housing in a specific area, and to a certain degree, it could be. If all the landlords in Burbank decided to raise rents, people might choose housing in North Hollywood, or Sun Valley. But if all the renters in the valley were getting an extra $1,000/mo, then many would accept higher rents. And since there could be more renters than available units (and few substitute options), prices could rise. 

https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-macroeconomics/basic-economics-concepts-macro/demand/v/price-of-related-products-and-demand

&gt;Complements are goods that are consumed together. Substitutes are goods where you can consume one in place of the other. The prices of complementary or substitute goods also shift the demand curve. When the price of a good that complements a good decreases, then the quantity demanded of one increases and the demand for the other increases. When the price of a substitute good decreases, the quantity demanded for that good increases, but the demand for the good that it is being substituted for decreases.",2021-10-28 23:13:33
joeg4,"There are some nice incentives with the USD-wBTC-wETH pool on curve, though of course you;d be exposing those funds to BTC and USD as well.    Or maybe check out Abracadabra on Fantom, deposit your eth as collateral and borrow MIM and then use that to farm.   Or do the same with QiDao/Mai finance on Polygon. 

 My strategy; 

Deposit ETH into Aave, then deposit those amETH tokens into Mai Finance, then deposit that (camWETH) into a vault on Mai, and borrow Mai to farm the tricrypto pool on Curve.    With this strategy you will be earning ETH, Qi, Curve, and wMatic.",2021-10-29 00:03:54

Also, places like Mazda do 0% interest regularly. There's lots to be said about car finance tbh. I'm about to sell my very sensible VW Golf after 2 years of a 4 year PCP. I'm in positive equity by £4k and got to drive a brand new car for two years.

Zukoismyhero,"As a woman myself I see where you are coming from. I've always been in the gifted class, I'm working on my 5th degree. I'm a bit ADHD so I've always had a million things going on, lots of hobbies, lost if interests. My boyfriend is a physician and I really love our intellectual conversations about science. I have traveled all over the world, love sociology and the human condition, love primate behavior. Love money, finance, business, real estate. Own a home and garden and do construction, play several instruments etc. Like computers and can fix or build just about anything. I have twin 16 year olds so ive done the mom thing for many years. Through that a million more skills like drawing and dinosaurs and videogames. 

And then sometimes I talk to people and its like they go through life like a rock falling down a hill. Unaware of the vastness of the universe or the flowers they crush. They just... Exist. No opinions no need for legacy. I like to say ""half the people are below average intelligence"" i cope with this by being in the medical field where my colleagues are very intelligent and by proxy interesting. 

However I would argue that this phenomenon of perpetual nothingness is not related to gender, rather it is related to intelligence. Women have an IQ bell curve that tends towards center while men are more spread out. So you get a higher percentage of genius men, fewer females, throw in some confirmation bias and bam... Women are all boring and dumb. However men also outnumber women in areas like special ed classes 4:1. They are more likely to fail out of school and have limited interests such as only porn and videogames, limited emotional range. Also they may talk about things you, as a guy, find more interesting. I can go on for hours about toddlers nap schedules or the role of estrogen in the body but you might find that dull because its not videogame related. 

My point is that you need to look at the breadth of a persons knowledge regardless of its relevance to you in order to decipher their capabilities. Meaning their overall intelligence without confirmation bias. 

Perhaps if you listened instead of waiting for your turn to talk with the assumption they will have nothing to offer you intellectuallly you will have more satisfying conversations, or perhaps, the women in your social circle are of below average intelligence.",2021-10-29 11:25:28

This is a very lucrative field to be in. And once you can sell for one tech company, you can almost always sell for another. These ppl are making six figures easily and from what I understand, this job can be done remotely. 

If you feel like you like accounting, this is also a decent path to go down. It won’t be as lucrative as tech sales in the beginning but if you work hard and make the right connections, you can move into a lot of those ‘sexy’ high finance roles after some experience. You would def need to get a CPA if choosing to be an accountant. More of a time investment for sure. Something to consider if you want to have time with your family. 

Maybe if I was in your position, I would look into tech sales. I can imagine that most of your competition for these roles haven’t sold $2.5m at 22 years old. This puts you way ahead of the curve.

2) Once you realize there's a potentially good project, they probably start with a discord channel where people talk and the teams start to shape up, spend some time speaking to people on those channels and you'll realize they have really REALLY nice info of other projects too.

/
/Boring DAO - a gateway for other chain tokens to be wrapped on the ethereum network - most notably they are looking to bridge the BTC, LTC and Doge chains to ethereum. 
Website https://boringdao.com

Convex Finance - this project is well known now. It is using the so called “bribery system” of onboarding new pools and pairs to Curve.fi in which stakers can deposit CRV which are locked for up to four years which boosts the yield generated from fees on the curve.fi AMM exchange. It would be near impossible without being a multi millionaire to achieve the boosted rewards the convex app is able to create through pooling. It’s also a place to gather all veCRV (CRV stakers) airdrops in one locale and gauge the amount of boost applied to each curve pool on the app via DAO voting of CVX tokens. Lock some CVX for an extra reward boost and gain voting rights. https://convexfinance.com/stake

GRO Protocol - I’m still learning more about this one but I gather it a way to have a decentralized stablecoin where you also have an insurance mechanism against volatility I think. It’s very interesting with a great yield.
GVT is the gro voting token and GRO is the main token utilized the protocol. You can deposit stablecoins and other internal pairs to earn GRO token rewards which are vested over 12 months. You can claim early but the longer you wait and the earlier you are at staking in the app the higher reward boost will be. 

All of those projects generating an impressive yield at the moment - boring Dao is likely the most risky but a great use case and with major potential for gains. GRO and Convex seem to be similar concepts to me built around rewards from other projects. 

My DeFi Veteran Pick of the Month is ArcX Passports which is a project that is building an on chain credit system which uses your past transactions and your interactions with Defi to generate a credit score.  You are provided a passport NFT which will be like a physical passport in a lot of ways which will allow the members to have unique opportunities compared to those that are not holders of a passport. You can also purchase skins that show your support for your favorite projects like
Chainlink, Aave, Furucombo and more. Skins will come with extra perks on those apps I’m sure. You can stake ArcX now if you have a passport. Get yours today there are only 1000 being issued in this Second round at https://app.ArcX.money

LSAS42069,"&gt;There are more ways to coerce besides government. It isn't government that initiates corruption, it is private parties who want to profit

Government just happens to be the greatest coercive element in all societies, and handing it more power only empowers the people you hate even more. Why empower the ruling class?

&gt;They pay officials directly, offer stock picks, lucrative board positions after leaving office, finance their campaigns and fund direct lobbying for laws. None of these things are initiated by government itself.

All of these are mitigated by mitigating government, see the above reply.

&gt;That's the first part of this you need to understand.

As if I don't understand this to an extent well beyond you.

&gt;Then the second part, and walk slowly here because this is tricky and it's called ""deductive reasoning:""

I'm surprised you know the phrase. Let's see if you can actually do it.

&gt;If a private individual/company/corporation can coerce government officials to pass laws that favor themselves over others

Nothing you said above was coercion against the lawmakers, they're all bribery, voluntary transactions. Hiring a hitman isn't coercion (between the hitman and buyer), for a comparitive example. The coercion exists between the government (hitman) and the subject (victim). Remove government power and the rich (employer) must seek another route to coerce or must cease coercion. 

&gt;then it must follow that government itself is not the first or only coercive power. Just let that sink in for a moment.

I never said government was the only coercive power, or the first. I said it was the biggest, the primary agent of coercion. It is, in fact, the biggest tool the ruling class uses against the creating class.

&gt;Do you know what these all have in common? Plastics and electronics. Clothing, lumber, refrigeration, etc, are manufactured and shipped and itemized all with the help of plastics and electronic technology.

And before that, their productivity was improved via non-transistorized controls and mechanical systems. Hyping this specific technology as if its economic impact is unique in type is fallacious.

&gt;But these are hardly the entire economy. Cost of education, healthcare, housing, childcare, lots of foods and other services have been increasing dramatically.

In the U.S. at least, all of these things are ridiculously regulated and interfered with by government. In the past two years we've also seen unusually large amounts of inflation, which itself is directly caused by government fiat.

&gt;Technology inexorably improves over time, but the real economy is much more complex and privatization has failed to deliver consistent results while we can see success attributable to publix efforts and simply technological incrementalization.

You just blamed market systems for problems directly attributable to government action. Please stop pretending I'm beneath you in comprehension here, you just proved you don't even know what you're talking about. Technological improvement is heavily influenced by incentives, namely profit motive leading investors to develop new tools. 

&gt;There is a thing called ""diminishing returns"" because costs do no always go down as production goes up. It is not infinite.

""Productivity"" not ""production"", genius. Lrn2english

&gt;You're cherry picking micro-level observations and ignoring entire other subfields in economics.

I'm not the one pretending one tech is magically different than other tech insofar as it relates to improving productivity and efficiency.

&gt;Moore's Law is unique to electronics, because it is literally describing processing power and transistor size over time

Moore's theory describes a universal phenomena that he observed in a specific piece of tech. Increasing efficiency over time due to profit motive driving competitive development isn't unique to transistors. That was my point earlier, but you seem bent on ignoring it.

&gt;Few other things behave this way, or have been as consistently reliable over time as Moore's Law. You are doing a lot of lazy hand-waving here.

Not fitting a specific curve does not exclude other tech from being part of the phenomenon. Nothing was hand-waved, you're just projecting your hyper-focus onto me.

&gt;You contrived one example of how innovation worked to prove an argument that privatization always leads to innovation and improvement

I contrived nothing. I stated that market systems are associated more strongly than any other systems with improved quality of life over time. I used one specific example because I'm not listing every example.

&gt;You pretending as if this was simply about electronic ""information tools"" is disingenuous at best and obnoxious gaslighting at worst. It's all in text above if you want to go read it again. 

I explicitly stated that the focus of the comparison was on informational tools in the paragraph right above the one about the 80's. If you actually read what I wrote and weren't a dishonest person, you'd understand that.

&gt;I'm an electrical engineer you idiot.

An appeal to authority fallacy, color me surprised. Mechanical and controls here, with a generic tech attitude. Neither of us is a computer engineer though, even if that was relevant. 

I said it above, Moore's theory described the process of product improvement, and he did a decent job of estimating his constant. Product improvement is not unique to transistorized processors, and similar curves can be seen in all sorts of products in the development stages as computer systems are.

&gt;So absurdly disingenuous. I'm arguing that privatization is not the only source of innovation or improvement

Never once did I state as much. So what you're saying here is that you're strawmanning me. Imagine that from someone who hates markets. 

&gt;That is an often-used claim by capitalists and it's the implicit argument you've been making here regarding education in this thread.

Except I never implied it at all. Markets doing better because of incentive structure doesn't mean non-markets can't still DO at all. They absolutely can still do things, just often not as well as markets. The soviet union developed nuclear tech, computers, etc without stealing all that much info from market systems. They just generally underperformed acrosd the board compared to more free systems.

&gt; I'm not arguing that the internet could never have been devised by profit-seeking entrepreneurs, I'm simply stating that it wasn't invented by profit-seeking entrepreneurs.

What is your implication here, being that I never asserted that non-markets are incapable of development?

&gt;Is it a half-truth or is it a logical fallacy?

A paragraph can include both. 

&gt;If it's a half-truth then it is true that inventions (and very good ones) can and do occur through government-funded projects and otherwise non-profit-seeking efforts by engineers and scientists.

Never said otherwise.

&gt;The fact that private commerce utilized it later is a much more complex issue and does not prove that the internet was only useful due to private commerce, it only shows that its benefits are best realized with more participants. A capitalist market is simply the primary vehicle for most activity in a capitalist market. You are making all kinds of non-sequitors.

I made not a single one, but would be glad to rebut whatever silly misinterpretations you have.

&gt;Mate this is some sad, desperate misdirection. Quit moving the goalpost.

The goalpost wasn't moved. You strawmanned me and them got butthurt over the strawman you made up. My interpretation of your examples was you saying ONLY government could make those products. I apologize for not asking for clarification, and for unintentionally strawmanning your words in my response.

&gt;Just acknowledge the world of evidence that private profits do not hold a monopoly on human inventiveness or creative effort.

I have acknowledged it several times now, and never rejected that fact.

&gt;It isn't tankie propaganda to point out that the Soviets literally beat the US in every space milestone.

It is tankie propaganda to use that fact as justification for hating markets.

&gt;The moon landing was a stunt that the US invented because it was the only place the soviets hadn't already gone to.

Whether it was real or a stunt, the end of your statement is correct.

&gt;Nothing about this is support for the USSR, it's just a fact that governments and public funding can be very effective. That's all I've argued.

Please forgive me for misunderstanding your argument. It appeared to me that you were suggesting that markets were inefficient compared to coercive systems.",2021-11-01 22:38:24

Several people who took over what I was doing and saw the obvious unethical and likely illegal  manipulation of data. They were all let go or quit. One of the VPs posted a negative review on Glassdoor.
Suddenly their Glassdoor positive reviews for the corporate office exceeded the number of staff. It was an absurd curve. Another finance guy wrote an email to Glassdoor to point out the obvious manipulation, and Glassdoor said they'd look into it. Three years later, nothing's changed.",2021-11-01 23:48:43

Even still an exponential curve at 10% return YOY for 35 yrs until 2025 starting at 200K in 1990 would yield roughly 5.6 million. A far cry from 30 million.

The paper also attacks the validity of aggregate production functions, which is how GDP is measured.

Moist_Lunch_5075,"The changes are really just to address criticism and people hyperparsing the term ""transitory"" to mean something it never really meant. In macroecon, ""transitory"" doesn't mean ""a couple of months"" which is how people misinterpreted the word. JPOW addressed this in the speech, but to those of us who understand that macro analysis takes place at larger timeframes, the misunderstanding that they were saying ""all prices back to normal in like a month"" never actually made sense. They kind of overestimated the intelligence of the average person in the finance industry, tbh. I've worked in this industry for over 20 years now and in many cases, it's not that high... in other cases people in this industry are very quick to replace rational interpretations with whatever they think serves their interests, so the Fed is just armoring their statements the same way I would in similar situations.

Nobody who understands how economic forecasting works thinks any of these statements are set in stone... adding ""expected to be"" is just saying something that is assumed to be true in any other normal circumstance among real, skilled economists.

Similarly ""supply chain issues"" weren't ignored before, but it's a very similar situation to the above... the virus causes trailing supply chain issues. We began forecasting what we're seeing now literally in February 2020... it's not a surprise to anyone who does economic forecasting and understands the relationship between socio-political situations like this and labor/supply disruption. What they're really citing there is that the supply chain issues are starting to alleviate, which goes along with a reduction in inflationary curve along with a small decline in GDP due to the delta variant and to some degree supply chain issues, but the two are and have always been attached to each other. They're not saying that there's some separate issue there, their language specifically cites ""easing of supply constraints"" which is a positive thing.

Wordsmithing to avoid opportunistic misunderstanding is something many nerds like myself had to learn early in our career. You'd think the Fed would be better at this but honestly, JPOW's pretty bad at it and you can actually match red candles on SPY when he's spending more time on things he shouldn't in his speeches. He's actually kind of tragically naïve when it comes to public relations.

This wording is just them learning to better wordsmith their statements... I wouldn't read anything further into it because they weren't really saying anything different in the meat of their reports before.",2021-11-04 04:20:29
ThisIsAMonere,"As promised above, here is a longer version of how this budget came to be below for those who might be curious:  
  
I began creating this budget in 2018. My sister asked me to create her a “simple budget” for her to use, and since I liked creating pretty spreadsheets for lots of things in my life, she figured I would be up to the task. I completed the first version in a few weeks, and she was thankful, but then she asked me for some more features: “Can I have it track my credit card and bank account balances as well?” Sure, done. “Can I enter a different budget every month instead of being married to the same amount every month?” Ok, a little harder, but I will make it work. “I started selling stuff on eBay and driving for DoorDah. Is there a way you can make it so that I never have to predict my income before I earn it, but rather, budget it after I earn the money?” Ok sister. You’re asking for a lot, but you’re my sister, and I love the challenge, so I will continue to work on it.  
  
Around that time, I started getting into FI/RE, downloaded Reddit, and joined some Personal Finance subs. I saw many, many, many other budget spreadsheets shared in lots of subs, and they all were cool in their own way, but… none of them were as \*pretty\* as I wanted my personal budget to be. I also never found one that didn’t require you to predict income. Even with a salaried job, I \*never\* earned the exact same amount of money every month (since I also had an Uber side hustle and a flipping side hustle), so none of them worked for me.   
  
Thus, a new goal was born: I wanted to create the world’s greatest Google Sheets Personal Budgeting Spreadsheet, and share it with the world on Reddit!  
  
This was no longer about creating a spreadsheet just for my sister. I wanted to create a spreadsheet that was different, intuitive, didn’t require any special formulas or copying and pasting, and any person with a basic understanding of how Excel or spreadsheet software works could use it.   
  
I created many, many iterations of this budget from 2018 - 2021, and I shared about 4 or 5 updated versions of them in another Personal Finance Sub here on Reddit. Each time, about 20-30 people would message me saying “Wow, this is exactly what I have been wanting to create but never could figure out!” One person even messaged me months later saying I had saved their marriage… WHAT?!? That was so cool. I really was just so excited to see people getting use out of this budget and it truly changing their lives.   
  
Once, I had someone comment “Oh cool, you just created YNAB in spreadsheet form.” I had never heard of YNAB, but I of course Googled it and was like “Wait a second…. These 4 Rules of YNAB are the same (unspoken) 4 Rules of my budget spreadsheet! How cool that me and someone else created budgets that are basically built on the same concepts but neither of us have either heard of each other?!”  
  
In the summer of 2021, I finally got the budget to a place that I said: “It is finished,” or, at least to a place where I felt like I could put my name next to it and share it with family and friends and not just strangers on the internet. I was also super pumped to share it again to that other Reddit finance sub that I had previously shared the budget with and had a great reception.  
  
So in July 2021, I shared it in the other sub, left to go on a quick errand, and came back to a crushing message in my Reddit account: “You have been permanently banned from this sub and there is no opportunity to appeal this decision.” I was shocked. I was sharing a free personal budgeting spreadsheet in a personal finance sub, yet somehow this was self-promotion? I messaged the mods to ask what had happened, and I had forgotten that I had left a link to my Etsy page buried at the end of the FAQ within the budget spreadsheet itself to give people the opportunity to purchase it if they wanted to. My bad. I promised to delete the link and never share a version of the spreadsheet with the link buried in the spreadsheet again, but they said no. I was permanently banned forever from that sub, period, since it went against their stated rules.  
  
And that was the end of my dream of sharing my Budgeting Spreadsheet with the world, so I just left it on Etsy without any fanfare and let people discover it organically. If I’m not allowed to share it for free on Reddit, might as well sell it for a measly $6, right?  
  
Enter November 1, 2021: YNAB changes its price, and I \*know\* that my budgeting spreadsheet could be so useful to people who like the YNAB principles and its way of treating money (since mine has a very similar principles and way of treating money, too), but given I had recently been banned from a different sub for sharing the spreadsheet, I was extremely hesitant to share it here without someone reporting me for self-promotion or getting mad at me for sharing a $6 budget that I sell on Etsy for free here. So I shared it under the guise of it being someone else’s sheet because I really, really, really just want people to get use from a budget spreadsheet that I’ve poured my heart and soul into.   
  
Enter November 2, 2021: u/BloomingFinances shares her YNAB-ish budget spreadsheet, and I am so so so thrilled to see that she gets a great response and isn’t banned! Yippee!! Her spreadsheet is AWESOME and I reached out to her thanking her for sharing her sheet, and she encourages me to share mine here, too.   
  
So, here we are! I have shared my sheet for free here because like I said from the beginning, I’ve only ever wanted people to get a better handle on their personal budgets with the help of the spreadsheet I’ve made. If it helps one person, I am happy. Feel free to reach out and ask any questions! Like YNAB, it has a learning curve, but in my experience, the HELP tab and the START HERE tab tell you everything you need to know to do the budget.  
  
Thanks, and happy budgeting!",2021-11-04 04:50:34
Ecstatic-Flounder-48,"I was finance/supply chain/accounting

The reason accounting is the hardest major is because it is a lot of information. One accounting class to me was worse than taking 5 other RBS classes at the same time. 

Another reason is that they have insanely difficult curves. Only the top 10% of grades get an A. That means you have to be on your shit 24/7. 

Some of the questions are also very tricky. If you can process large amounts of information and work well under pressure, then the tests aren't difficult, they're just extremely comprehensive. But to most people, accounting is nerve-wracking and those nerves tend to screw with you during the exams. Especially when exams can be 40% of the final grade.

Finance has professors that shoot for an 80-82 final grade average. They will curve to that. So there is no % required to get an A and getting a B is a lot easier. Exams are worth less (typically)

Supply chain curves to like an 85-86, typically. (Exams are worth way less, typically - you have more projects). 

Lastly, accounting is hard because the classes overlap and don't overlap at the same time. Advanced accounting is accounting regarding buying companies, and some government accounting (which shouldn't even be called accounting tbh). Tax accounting is just a bunch of simple math with rules that keep changing (but you don't use 'accounts'). Point being, there's a lot of variation in the types of thinking you need to do in accounting as opposed to finance where EVERY SINGLE CLASS IS LITERALLY: stocks, then bonds, then options, then futures (prove me wrong). Supply chain classes are mainly just memorization of facts and the tests have NO variation (T/F then MC then short answer - fill in the blank (with word banks sometimes)). 

Accounting is probably the most valuable degree I've gotten from Rutgers. But finance has the potential to give you the most interesting lifestyle (because you have a lot more job options with a finance degree than a supply chain or accounting degree).  

If you like accounting, do accounting. It's insanely rewarding. But if you need a high gpa for a grad program down the line and you don't really need accounting, don't do accounting.",2021-11-04 06:07:36

DailyScreenz,"In finance classes and textbooks you will hear academics talk about the risk return curve shifting when leverage is applied, maybe search around for William Sharpe, he's written a lot of textbooks and articles on MPT (even Markowitz might have something on it).   It is not that hard to figure out really with actual data.  If you want to test leverage get returns for the S&amp;P 500 each month and something that approximates monthly financing cost (like Fed Funds) and put it in a spreadsheet.  For 2 to 1 leverage assume you have $50, the formula looks like \[100 exposure\* S&amp;P monthly return - less the $50 leverage \* monthly financing rate\].  You then divide this dollar profit or loss number by your $50 starting equity to get your monthly return.   You can change the equity level to test different amounts of leverage, but that is basically all you need to test out the approach using real data!  Hope this helps!",2021-11-04 22:01:44
marcuscontagius,"Look at defi and crypto as a utility, not a security. Pick projects with strong fundamentals and a good team, no different than investing in a company. Go with projects that have good interoperability across a number of layer 1 protocols. Understand that utility cases for defi you want to invest in and what you are and aren’t comfortable with in terms of risk. There are some absolute insane returns to the point where it only takes a few hundred dollars to make real money on a short time horizon, understand the analogous use cases in the sphere of private finance and see which you like better. Be smart and do your DD.

An example I like to use is curve finance, they are a stable coin swap and liquidity pool app on a number of different layer 1 networks. I see it as essentially the forex for the digital dollars that will be present in a few years. They are fully decentralized (governed by users who vote with there DAO governance tokens - think shares - just like an AGM for a stock or company) and have superior protocol to competitors and because of this, offer better rates for stable coin swaps. I’m not shilling for this particular defi app and you must always have a strong fundamental understanding of where you’re putting your money. But I believe they are a good example of a blockchain utility with strong fundamentals. Check out “defi 2.0”.

Crypto is the real deal and it ain’t going away. People don’t want to be beholden to rich bankers or private institutions with no visibility of what’s really going on and what they’re money is actually doing, they’d rather have a stake in their money’s management and financial freedom that is usually only afforded to large net worth individuals. Yes there will be higher volatility until regulation comes into effect across the globe but let’s remember this is an incredibly young technology still. Learn about the layer one solutions that exist, learn about how to use it and throw a weeks worth of lunch money into something from time to time.",2021-11-04 22:22:53

red-tea-rex,"&gt;Social housing does increase private wealth because occupants pay no or far less rent so they have more money to spend on acquiring their own assets. Instead of a landlord getting the money to spend, they get to spend it themselves. The same amount of money is being spent in the economy, but the distributon of that spending is much more equal.

False. Government housing, rent control, and other housing ""price fixing"" schemes have been proven to drive up the cost of housing for those just above the bottom, since in most cities there are restrictions and limits on how much housing can be built. So essentially price controls distort the supply-demand curve by reducing market rate housing supply driving up demand for it and the corresponding price on entry-level lower- to middle-class housing. Take S.F. and NYC for example. More rent controls than just about anywhere, and they are two of the highest COL metro areas in the world. Guess who benefits? Landlords.

&gt;. Hyperinflation only occurs if money is continually printed to pay off ever increasing debts.

The current U.S. debt is nearly 30 trillion, a [33% jump](https://datalab.usaspending.gov/americas-finance-guide/debt/trends/) in just four years. This appears to be on a fairly linear trend line. If we jump 10 trillion every 4 years we will be insolvent in a decade and a half with a 4 trillion annual tax revenue. But it doesn't accelerate all at once. Each 30 trillion or so will mean an additional 1 trillion in interest depending on rates, and that much less available to fund government, so that much additional per year to be taken as even more debt. So it'll happen even sooner.

&gt;If you print money to pay for labor to produce productive assets such as buildings and machines, then the money that was printed is essentially ""backed"" by those assets.

It's not. It's primarily paid out to bureaucrats and social benefits recipients who don't produce anything tangible, and tend to contribute the lowest level of production to the economy, so it's empirically  the least productive use of the money. So by your argument this is the fastest way to cause inflation.",2021-11-05 11:59:37
BroChapeau,"FDR ***extended*** the great depression. His [1933 gold seizure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102) stole every American's gold, exchanging it for dollars which he soon after arbitrarily set at half of the pre-seizure value. Yep, he ***stole*** half of countless Americans' wealth.

He then set the price of gold differently every day, at a time with the gold exchange standard meant that setting the gold price was the same as setting the dollar value. The purpose of this was to shut down the private capital markets - since nobody could predict what dollars would be worth in the future when investments paid off. He then used this destroyed capital market as an excuse to create the FHA, farm subsidies, and many other paternalistic, central power programs.

Ever heard of the [crash of 1920](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_of_1920%E2%80%931921)? It was more severe than 1929, but because there was no bail outs or new deal the debt was liquidated and the economy was back on track in a year. Recessions are supposed to be SEVERE and BRIEF.

Labor unions were not illegal; instead the Wagner Act created special privileges for them and thus violated freedom of contract. This is FDR centralizing power and buying the labor constituency (part of the construction of the corrupt power dealing political machine, which had theretofore never happened Federally).

Social security is a paternalist program of forced savings that functions as a piggy bank for politicians to raid as a kind of slush fund and disguised tax increase. This is FDR centralizing power and buying the elders constituency (part of the construction of the corrupt power dealing political machine, which had theretofore never happened Federally).

The FDIC puts taxpayers on the hook for deposits, removing the responsibility that banks have to lend wisely and thus protect their depositors' assets. It's a gift to banks, allowing them to freely speculate and lend nearly all of depositors' money, operating on a shoestring and juicing profits. It also discourages the poor from holding assets instead of fiat currency, and thus enables money printing. This is FDR centralizing power and buying the bankers constituency (part of the construction of the corrupt power dealing political machine, which had theretofore never happened Federally). 

Note that there were other giveaways to banks, because FDR came from a wealthy east coast finance family connected to the Rockefellers. One of these giveaways was the Accredited Investor Rule embedded in the Securities and Exchange Act. This rule even today discriminates against the poor, barring them from investing in private equity offerings, which represent the large majority of upside opportunities in the equity market. The legacy of this is represented today in the fact the Blackstone dominates even local real estate markets, local capital formation is a tiny fraction of the markets, and most folks' largest investment is their home because they can't invest in startups and new businesses.

Farm subsidies bought the rural landowning constituency, and so on, and so on.

FDR tried price fixing, threatened to pack the court which successfully intimidated them in to suddenly declaring laws constitutional 4 years after they'd declared nearly identical laws unconstitutional, and goaded Japan in to attacking Pearl Harbor.

FDR is worthy of unending scorn. Many people say if they could go back in time and rub out one person, it'd be hitler. I'd pick FDR; he destroyed American limited government and replaced it with a centralized corrupt welfare state completely unaccountable to the people.

As Garet Garrett says, the New Deal was utterly ineffectual if the goal was ending the depression. But it wasn't; if looked at for the power centralization project that it actually was, it all makes sense.

&gt;*There are those who still think they are holding the pass against a revolution that may be coming up the road. But they are gazing in the wrong direction. The revolution is behind them. It went by in the Night of Depression, singing songs to freedom.*  
  
*There are those who have never ceased to say very earnestly, ""Something is going to happen to the American form of government if we don't watch out."" These were the innocent disarmers. Their trust was in words. T****hey had forgotten their Aristotle. More than 2,000 years ago he wrote of what can happen within the form, when ""one thing takes the place of another,*** *so that the ancient laws will remain, while the power will be in the hands of those who have brought about revolution in the state.""*  
  
*Worse outwitted were those who kept trying to make sense of the New Deal from the point of view of all that was implicit in the American scheme, charging it therefore with contradiction, fallacy, economic ignorance, and general incompetence to govern.*  
  
*But it could not be so embarrassed, and all that line was wasted, because, in the first place, it never intended to make that kind of sense, and secondly, it took off from nothing that was implicit in the American scheme.*  
  
*It took off from a revolutionary base. The design was European. Regarded from the point of view of revolutionary technique, it made perfect sense. Its meaning was revolutionary and it had no other. For what it meant to do, it was from the beginning consistent in principle, resourceful, intelligent, masterly in workmanship, and it made not one mistake.*  
  
*...*  
  
*The end held constantly in view was power.*  
  
*In a revolutionary situation, mistakes and failures are not what they seem. They are scaffolding. Error is not repealed. It is compounded by a longer law, by more decrees and regulations, by further extensions of the administrative hand. As deLawd said in The Green Pastures, that when you have passed a miracle you have to pass another one to take care of it, so it was with the New Deal. Every miracle it passed, whether it went right or wrong, had one result. Executive power over the social and economic life of the nation was increased. Draw a curve to represent the rise of executive power and look there for the mistakes. You will not find them. The curve is consistent.*

Joker042,"&gt; What kinds of roles are out there

Go to an analytics meet up in your area, talk to people. There are so many different roles out there in so many different types of company.

&gt; as a CPA, how would one's path differ

Yeah, good question, as I said to someone else, I'd be looking for an FP&amp;A or similar job in a company with a really good understanding of data and a good analytics team. A good company will be OK with you saying ""Yeah, I'm signing up for an FP&amp;A role, and I'll do it for a couple of years, but I want to be learning from the analytics guys in that time, and seeing how I can use that knowledge the help the finance team, then eventually I'd like to apply for a job in analytics""

&gt; what is the typical department hierarchy

Really really depends on the size of the company and the size of the analytics function. Generally you'll have a CTO who will have someone under them with ""data"" and / or ""analytics"" in their job title. Could be ""insights"" also. Some companies will have one or two centralised teams of analysts. Some will have a couple out in the each of the functional areas of the company. Some will have both a centralised ""centre of excellence"" and analysts emended in functional teams. Additionally, you'll have platform support for the analytics platform.

&gt; is the nature of your work completely ad hoc or do you have recurring/cyclical work tasks

I moved from a job which was about 75% BAU tasks like budgeting and reporting to one that is 100% green fields projects. You'll see the whole spectrum, and 95% of analysts will have some repetitive component to their job. Learning to automate and streamline that component is critical to freeing yourself up enough to kick some ass and impress some people.

&gt; Do you have stressful deadlines?

Yes and no. I've certainly had a couple, but if I'd needed to I could have delayed a project launch, but there were some reasons not to. I chose to ""be a hero"", I burned out, I took some time off, and I learned a lesson. Dunno if I'd do the same again. Generally, I try to stay pretty far ahead of my deadlines.

&gt; how much responsibility do you have in gathering and vetting the source data you use? Or do you draw aone in the sand and say that the data is the data and it's only your job to analyze it?

I would never draw that line in the sand. I know people that would and that the key difference between them and me. If I'm on a project, people know that I will do 100% of what needs to be done to make sure there's a good result. That includes finding other people's fuckups and helping them fix it in a way that makes them look good (if they'll let me help them, if not then I can be an asshole when I need to be - if the project warrants it). I'm the kind of person that wants to understand how the sensors on the machinery which generated my data work, the ETLs which get them from one place to another and the potential weaknesses in the system. Even if we can't fix them, we can identify them and be honest with the stakeholders about them. Your stakeholders want to make good decisions and it's the analysts job to enable that.

&gt; can't perfectly predict the future.



Your work can 100% be wrong. The difference is people may not ever notice. I've taken over processes which were producing believable but incorrect results and had to tear them down and rebuild them in a hurry. You do get the odd exec with a fucking brilliant nose for ""that doesn't seem right, how can that number be higher than that other one in that month, when the moving average is...."" - and in those moments all you can do is smile and say ""You know what, it looks like you may be right, let's look into that"". Meanwhile you need to have checked and double checked your shit enough that even if the find an inconsistency, you're comfortable with the outcomes of the analysis to say ""but, I think that'll only move us a few percent and the advice will be the same, give me a few days and I'll confirm, thanks for that!""

Remember, most analysis is descriptive, only some is predictive and even then you need to be able to sketch out the basis on which the prediction is made.

&gt; you can't be penalized if actual results differ from what you told management a year ago. Instead you'll re-tool your model. 

Depends on the analysis. I think you've got too much of an FP&amp;A hat on here thinking about forecasting. But, even if your forecast is off, you need to be able to explain WHY it was off. ""We had a cooler summer than the average, so we sold less icecreams"" is absolutely fine, you're not a weatherman, but ""Ummm, that's just what the model said"" gets you replaced with someone who actually understands their models. This is why the comment about regression and decisions trees being more powerful in the real world than better higher performing models is there. You can communicate how they work, and that's gold.

&gt; So, what would a ""fuck up"" look like in your role? 

Dunno, I'll tell you when I find out :)

But the one I'm most at risk of every day is overpromising on timelines and functionality.

In my job, there's a set of mistakes I could make that would theoretically result in incorrect information being included in a release to the stock market. That would be a very big problem. But I'm not the only one who works on that, we all check each others work, and I calculate those numbers three separate ways and check them against each other. Other people calculate them too and check my work.

I've made small mistakes that weren't my mistake. I inherited a horrendously complicated model which didn't correctly implement an inflation curve we used. I didn't realise this till the budget numbers were locked in. It wasn't a huge issue, and it hadn't worked for 5 years before I got there and no one noticed. I pointed it out, fixed the model it was all fine. As long as you're good at your job and open and honest with your team it's not an issue. If it is an issue, you've got a shit boss / team and need to find another place to work.

&gt; Is there more gray area when it comes to your type of work?

Good analysis can be a discussion, can be a back and forth between you and the stakeholder. You're allowed to not be sure, you're allowed to explore and discuss an approach and succeed or fail as a team - as long as you KNOW when you've failed and don't push it into production. It's collaborative and creative when it's done right. It's a journey.",2021-11-05 22:48:40

But, the biggest hurdle in ALL these now is connectivity.  Unreliable connectivity is a huge issue.

And to me, if I can't connect to my banks and financial institutions, then why even bother with personal finance software to begin with?

I'm not that smart when it comes to programming or spreadsheets.  I'm really not.  But I can certainly create some worksheets to enter my transactions and create monthly/yearly reports that I can use with sorting options and filters.

In my case, I use Quicken Windows and Mac (don't ask why).  Either will do a really good job beyond the basics and their reports are top notch, including investment tracking.  The Windows version is really good, but complex and has a high learning curve.  The mobile app with the Windows version sucks.  The Mac version of Quicken is easier to use, more modern looking, but not as feature rich.  I use the mobile app with the Mac version and it seems to be stable and work.

But there are plenty of other fine personal finance products out there.  You just need to try them out and see if it fits your needs.  Your needs are probably different than mine and others.  Some are desktop products, some are web based, some are Excel based.

For example, if you have a Microsoft 360 subscription, you can use Money in Excel for free.  It's basically an aggregator where your transactions download and then the Excel part does the ""reporting"" for you.  And because it's Excel, you can create whatever spreadsheets you want.

Tiller is also a variation of this.  Google spreadsheet based aggregator and reporting.

&gt;I don’t like the 1% establishment politicians either, they’re bought out by the 1% companies in order to maintain the legislative loopholes for taxes.

then stop supporting them by advocating for policies they use to become richer and more powerful by taxing everything.

taxes are used to steal from the working class to accumulate more money to the 1%.

remember those covid relief checks, guess where it all went. 

from everyone's pay checks that was working to everyone working or not's pockets and then to a global corporation like wal-mart.

all small businesses was forced closed in states that forced covid mandates by the government while corporate stores remained opened.

the moment those checks was passed to be given out, wal-mart lined their center aisles with TV's for the same price.

I respect real socialist, they band together and form a commune, they don't try and force it on others with guns.

the rest of you lot are grifters or lay abouts that want a free ride off other people.

here you are all happy world governments are pushing for a 15% tax on global corporations but everyone has to pay more for goods across the board.

those corporations will absorb those taxes into the cost of the products and services, which has a domino affect on everything, 15% to mine the iron, 15% to smelt the iron, 15% to form the steel, 15% to ship the steel, 15% to use the steel.

that is 5 taxes to 1 for an end product and 75% price increase the cost of 5 companies taking something from its raw form to a finished product to the consumer.

I kept it simple because in reality, between each step is shipping from a shipping company.

money is not something that poofs into the world from the ether.

money is stored labor, the more you tax it, the more it cost for labor.

the more you allow the government to print money, the more you dilute what labor is worth.

how about instead of trying to rob everyone of their labor, we keep more money in peoples pockets and put the government on a fucking diet.",2021-11-07 04:03:14

**What is Euphoria?** 🤝, 🤝

Euphoria is an algorithmic reserve currency protocol that will initially start out as a fork of OHM &amp; Wonderland.

In the initial phase the protocol will very much mimic OlympusDAO:
There will be two tokens: WAGMI and sWAGMI (i.e. staked WAGMI)
Every WAGMI token is backed by at least 1 DAI in the treasury
When WAGMI is &gt;$1 the protocol will create new supply via direct sales into the market
When WAGMI is &lt;$1 supply will be burned by the means of direct purchases from the market

**How does it work?**

Given that the protocol is a direct fork of OlympusDAO &amp; Wonderland, Euphoria will work in the exact same way:

The protocol is the only actor that can mint or burn supply, in contrast to other algorithmic reserve projects or algo-stablecoins that allow market participants to regulate the supply via e.g. arbitrage incentives.
The supply isn’t expanded or subtracted based on arbitrary algorithms — it’s backed by actual market activities carried out by the protocol and its treasury:

- When WAGMI is &gt;$1 the protocol will create new supply via direct sales into the market
- When WAGMI is &lt;$1 supply will be burned by the means of direct purchases from the market
- As such, WAGMI will always be backed by real assets in its treasury

New reserves are acquired by the protocol by the means of selling discounted WAGMI tokens to market participants that decide to bond treasury reserve assets for WAGMI.
Another way to look at this is that participants can actively mint WAGMI at a discount by selling e.g. DAI or WAGMI/DAI to the protocol for a larger amount of WAGMI than what can be acquired via the open market.

Back when Viper launched in March we originally intended to airdrop 5,000,000 tokens to active users as well as governance participants of Yearn Finance, Aave, Curve, Yam, and other DeFi products that were popular in the glorious DeFi summer of 2020.

50% of this airdrop allocation was eventually allocated as rewards to the xVIPER -&gt; VIPER single-staking pool on ViperSwap.
What remains is 2,500,000 VIPER tokens, or roughly ~$2,500,000

- The (💎, 🙌) incentives program will start at the time of the Euphoria launch and will last until December 31st, 2022, roughly ~13 months.

- The program will reward certain desirable actions that will likely change on a month-to-month basis, or even more frequently if required by current market conditions.

- For the first phase that starts in November 85% of the rewards will be allocated to those who bond DAI, WAGMI/DAI, UST and/or WAGMI/UST with the protocol. 15% will be allocated to WAGMI stakers. The more you bond and stake, the more of the rewards you’ll receive.

ManagerSalt9523,"I have some knowledge in finance, limited in econ. I’ll hazard a response based on what I’ve pieced together over time, but no have qualms about being set straight.  
  
If you’re interested in the specific examples (ag and hospo), in theory ag would be a better inflation hedge by my reasoning. Commodity-driven sectors (such as energy and materials tend to be among the best performers in high inflation environments; although beware this is partly by definition). Needs (i.e. inelastic demand) tend to make consumer staples somewhat of an inflation hedge (consumers will pay what they have to). Depending on the exact activity you have in mind, ag companies often share commodity and/or staple attributes. Hopso is more discretionary in nature (i.e. inverse of staples).   
  
More broadly its possible to generalise somewhat (e.g. real estate tends to be a reasonable inflation hedge provided that rents are not locked in too far out – in which case it becomes more bond-like which is bad when inflation is high; ‘growthy’ companies with long duration cash flows are among those more likely to suffer, as future cash flows become less valuable in today’s terms). As a general rule, worry about inflation more when a company has limited pricing power (i.e. customers may balk if faced with the prospects of higher prices).   
  
Unfortunately there are plenty of exception to the rules because under-standing the pre-conditions for inflation is important to identify winners and losers during a particular bout (e.g. while staples are generally inflation hedges they tend to underperform when transfer payments occur or there is a savings glut).

Although, if inflation persists, over time the origins may become less relevant. If there’s enough inflation under certain conditions it can become self-fulfilling (at least when unchecked). E.g. steeper Phillips curve when inflation is higher (which is to say, if the labour force is tight when there are noticeable price changes people are more inclined to demand higher wages-&gt; more fuel).  

Implications of inflation are further complicated by the distinction between expected and unexpected inflation. The latter can be more damaging as prices/rates may begin to incorporate compensation for risk – this is where matters such as supply chain length (i.e. timeframe to produce and deliver a good or service) start to feature.",2021-11-08 17:37:32

rawlskeynes,"This article is misleading to the point that it borders on misinformation, and I'm disappointed that it was posted here, especially without context.  In fact, the latter may be worse, because the article was designed to talk about investing generally, whereas it was posted here into the context on personal investors usually saving for retirement, which mean that the assumptions of the article (particularly the use of iso-elastic utility and the ludicrous assumption that an investor is making a one time investment) are simply not applicable for the overwhelming majority of people.  But anyways, on to the article:

It's a motte and bailey.  The motte, as it so often is, is a true statement: that ""the standard deviation of the total return actually increases with time horizon"".  The bailey is suggesting that this somehow refutes the idea that young people should be more aggressive in their investing.  I can't challenge the motte, it's simple math, so let's focus on the bailey.

To be clear, this assertion that your asset allocation should be independent of time horizon flies in the overwhelming consensus of financial experts and advisors, including John Bogle, who thinks (overly conservatively, in my opinion) that an investor should hold somewhere between their age and their age minus 10 in bonds.  Not to start out with an appeal to authority, but I do want to emphasize how out of the norm for investing advice this article is.

Fallacy one: Iso-elastic utility

The thing that fundamentally separates the motte from the bailey is that using simple variance as a measure of risk is ridiculous, because in the case of compounding growth, so much of that variance happens at the upper end of the curve, where you are much less risk sensitive.  One of the primary assumptions of this article is that an investor's level of risk is independent of wealth.  This is not true for any real world investor.  And the defense of using this criteria, that you could come up with a hypothetical investor who could be risk neutral as their wealth increases and be ""not pathological"" is hogwash.

If you're reading this, the overwhelming odds are that you want to be more conservative as your wealth relative to your age increases.  This is simply because the ability of a dollar to improve your life falls as you have more money.  The author's only example to the contrary is a hypothetical investor who has so much money that she can absorb massive risk and still be totally fine (If that's you, feel free to stop reading here.  Congrats!  You've won capitalism, and what I'm writing here is not necessarily applicable to you).  That rare example aside, we know that the overwhelming majority of retirement investors are and should be more conservative as their wealth increases relative to their age, and that breaks the math that comes later in the article.

Fallacy two: Three years is not a long time frame

This article makes a lot of bad faith comparisons of one year and three year outcomes to try to obscure the relative safety that comes from investing over decades:

&gt;It's interesting to note that the S\&amp;P; 500 has never had a loss anywhere near as large as 61% in a single year. (The largest one year loss was 43% in 1931.) It took three years of smaller losses to add up to the 61% total loss over 1930-1932.

The reality is that for large economic downturns, it typically takes multiple years for them to develop.  If the argument being posited here was that an investor with a 3 year time horizon should not be more conservative than an investor with a 1 year time horizon because the returns of year X are so closely correlated with year X + 1 in worst case scenarios, I don't think anyone would be bothering to argue.  But the argument is that risk doesn't decrease over time, so there's probably the same 60% loss over a longer period of time, right?  Do 15 years!

&gt;consider the 15 years from 1968 through 1982, when **after adjusting for inflation** the S\&amp;P; 500 lost a total of 4.62%.

Oh.

Fallacy three: Bad faith understanding of probability of shortfall

The author bothers to point out that not all shortfalls are the same, and then stops there, as though you couldn't possibly quantify that potential shortfall.  The truth is that probability of shortfall is a simplified, imperfect way of approximating something that's going to be impossible to calculate for an individual investor: their expected returns adjusted for the impact on their utility.  But it's still a better measure of risk than what the author uses, which is simple variance which pretends (incorrectly) that a user is risk neutral relative to wealth.  But ultimately, probability of shortfall gets us to understand the underlying thing we should be thinking about: what are the odds that equities underperform the next best option, and by how much, in our time horizon.  Hint: if you have access to a risk free 6% return, either because you're maxing out T bills right now or because, like the author, you have access to the world's best bank account, it's a pretty reasonable decision to incorporate that into your portfolio.

Fallacy four: That you're only investing once

The thing that might be most egregious about this article is the unquestioned assumption that you're investing once, rather than continuously over time, as most of us are.  The latter is the key component of time diversification, because you get a portion of the relative returns for each point in the time period.  So yeah, the market might drop 61% in the next three years, but that also means that in 3 years you're buying stocks at a 40% discount from what you'd be paying now, at a time when they're more likely to be bouncing back.  1928 was a pretty rough time to try to retire based on your savings in equities, but it'd a good time to start investing (if you somehow had a stable, good paying job through the great depression) because you'd have gotten a 54% return on your money in 1933, a 48% return in 1935, and a 34% return in 1936.  This is the primary reason you have more safety over time, and it's completely mystifying that it was ignored here.

All together, utility is one of the messier concepts to integrate into economics and finance, because it's hard to quantify.  But that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, doesn't mean you shouldn't factor it in (indeed, it's the reason you'd be risk averse in the first place), and doesn't mean that you should pretend you time horizon is irrelevant.  If you're 20 and you're reading this headline and considering switching your portfolio allocation to the same one you're planning on having 5 years before you retire, I'd strongly encourage you to reconsider.",2021-11-08 22:44:59

harfyi,"The biggest surprise during the first two days of the pandemic-delayed UN Climate Summit in Glasgow came from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who made a series of bold commitments to green energy. India already ranks third for renewable energy capacity; Modi pledged to quintuple India's current 100 gigawatts of renewable energy generation to 500 gigawatts by 2030. That number is higher than the country's entire electricity generation capacity today.

Modi also pledged to slash the carbon intensity of India's economy by 45%. He promised that steps like these would let India cap its greenhouse emissions by 2070 — pledging to a timeline he had long resisted — and eliminate a billion tons of carbon pollution a year this decade. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency said that India's commitment was a significant step towards showing to the world, for the first time, one available road map to cap warming below two degrees Celsius.

What made this grand pronouncement from the world's second most populous country possible? Modi could commit to such emission reductions for one reason: India is driving down the experience curve – perhaps the most crucial factor about the economics of clean energy.

Not only do wind, solar, batteries, electric vehicles and heat pumps get cheaper over time. They get cheaper faster if we just build more of them. This is their unique, almost magical property. If we want cheaper clean energy, we merely need to build more of it. This phenomenon – called the experience curve – has been demonstrated for solar panels, wind turbines, LED lights, and lithium ion batteries. And it has been occurring for decades.

It does not apply to mature technologies like coal-fired power plants, internal combustion engines, or gas furnaces and water heaters. The more oil we burn, the more it costs, as we are experiencing right now. The more solar, the cheaper it gets, as this graph from Our World in Data shows.

India is perhaps the best example of a country that has ridden the experience curve to cheaper and cheaper renewable power — in spite of the fact that it started later than rivals like China, and had to overcome high-cost domestic capital.

Indeed, India has doubled its renewables capacity roughly every five years – five-fold in the last decade.

India is probably the biggest renewables success story among developing economies. But it is not alone. The International Energy Agency reports that solar power is, in most of the world, already the cheapest electricity — far cheaper than new coal or gas plants.

And it's not just solar and wind that fall in price as they grow in size. The next crucial clean energy technology – advanced batteries needed to enable the shift in the transportation sector to electricity, as well as to manage the intermittency of wind and sunshine – also displays a steep experience curve. Deploying today's batteries faster not only makes tomorrow's cheaper, but actually pays for itself almost immediately.

Yet even with these examples and this data, even with the media focus on how desperate the climate threat has become, it's clear in Glasgow that advocates of effective, rapid climate progress must still wrestle with a persistent and crippling myth – that any rapid decarbonization transition will make us poorer. That myth is one of the major factors making it hard for the Glasgow COP to overcome the divisions among industrial and developing nations, carbon importing and exporting economies.

The new form of climate denial here in Glasgow is, ""Yes, let's get off fossil fuels – but gradually. That will be safer."" (You also hear it in the US, particularly from Senator Joe Manchin and the oil industry.) It won't be.

This myth is very dangerous. While driving fast down the experience curve is a reliable way to cut energy costs and carbon emissions, it is not an automatic market response to the need for cheaper, cleaner energy. If you want cheaper energy, you have to decide to grow your cleaner energy as fast as you can.

Why is it safer to decarbonize faster, rather than slower?

First, when energy costs start high — as they did with renewables — markets won't grow without policy intervention.

But making renewables cheaper is a game of scale. As the experience curve illustrates, costs go down not with time but with the scale of deployment: ""more is cheaper,"" not ""later is cheaper."" Waiting makes energy more expensive.

With clean energy technologies, the curve is predictable and stable. Each doubling of deployment cuts cost at the same rate as previous growth. 

Initially, the experience curve requires a country to buy costly renewable power. However, since market share is low initially, one doesn't buy very much of this costly clean energy. Only later, after a solid initial investment, do renewables become cheap. Steadily increasing volumes of this cheaper clean energy are sourced to replace expensive fossil fuel power, lowering the average electric bill. Moving slowly merely delays these benefits, raising costs in the meantime.

Likewise, early on, as the hard costs of technologies drive the experience curve down; these cost gains are global. China benefited from Germany's investment in solar cell efficiency, and India took advantage of Chinese cost gains.

Later, the soft costs of innovation – finance and regulation in particular – need to fall. Late arrivals to a technology still need to drive down their own local soft cost experience curve. India perfected its auction system to drive its solar prices below China's, even though it has not yet caught up in making panels. Vietnam lagged India in deploying solar. But in only two years of investing in solar, the country had increased its electrical generation capacity by 25%, and cut local solar costs in half.

Yet most countries are still refusing to either permit or finance sufficiently rapid renewables expansion. Indonesia has yet to emulate either India or Vietnam. Its renewable energy costs are 3-4 times higher than its neighbors. Australia rolled out a very simple regulatory model for deploying rooftop solar years ago. The US declined to adopt it. Hence, US rooftop solar costs 2½ times as much as Aussie consumers pay.

Cheap, clean energy is there to be had. But you do have to chase it. Not risk, but inertia and obstruction from special interests are the biggest barrier to getting off fossil fuels. Too much of the time and energy at Glasgow is spent arguing about the past – how we put ourselves at risk of climate catastrophe. Not enough is learning from the success stories that can still get us back on track.

What's not to embrace about a clean energy revolution that enables every country to be energy self-sufficient, ends the scourge of air pollution, rescues the climate – and drives the cost of energy lower than it has ever been?",2021-11-09 01:48:38
RICOVERTHEDREAM,"For everyone that wants some more info regarding Celer Network (CELR)  


*Holding CELR is a long term play. Celer Network is uniquely positioned to offer significant contributions to both the interoperability and DeFi spaces. By promoting seamless communication between different blockchain networks, interoperability is where the future lies. Blockchain projects that want to implement interoperability into their platform aim to create an ecosystem that will enable different blockchains to communicate with each other easily. We are moving in the direction where multiple block chains will cooperate and are used in unison for a particular purpose. As a trustless bridge, cBridge can take incredible advantage of this trend. Trustless bridges work on mathematical truths and are without any human errors or corruption. They enable the interoperability of tokens between different networks. For example, Ethereum can use this ability to offload its transactions to another blockchain. Also, trustless bridges help reduce congestion in blockchains with high volumes of transactions, providing users a seamless transaction experience.*    
   
*Let's also not forget the global problem of inflation directly addressed with the deflationary assets in the crypto space that are being more accepted worldwide each passing day. This is creating the scenario for explosive growth in the DeFi space over the next several years, and Celer Network is also poised to take advantage of the shifts to greater adoption of DeFi. Layer2.Finance is a DeFi aggregator with L2 scaling built-in, allowing people to use protocols such as AAVE or Curve and apply L2 scaling to them, rather than requiring them to build on Celer. Also, it doesn't just bring L1 DeFi to L2. It also aggregates other L2 and sidechains and allows liquidity to flow across seamlessly and cheaply. Layer2.Finance aims to be a multi-chain layer 2 DeFi platform. For it to achieve that, cBridge is needed for use cases that need to bridge liquidity across networks. Having cBridge also means that Celer does not have to call out to third-party services to bridge assets. With this said, Celer Network will have synergy across both of these products and their SGN to provide additional utility to the CELR token. These are only the plans the team has released so far and there is much more to come. The future is very bright for this project.*",2021-11-09 01:56:36

Mallardshead,"BTC's current market cap is half that of this single US company: Microsoft. BTC is currently 1/10th the market cap of gold (which is $11T). BTC my brother Devinaire, is still a ""speculative investment"" according to mainstream talking points, and one you should only ""invest what you can afford to lose"". The above explains how cheap BTC is currently and how much time we have left to accumulate until the global confidence curve of crypto flattens to a Nebraskan landscape. I'll add BTC has been around for 12 years, and in that time, when was the best time to sell BTC? 

Never.

$1M is a cute round number, but not close enough to the law of diminishing returns. $5M is better. Hyperbitcoinization also happens around this price. You see Devinaire, even I've become a victim of its tenacity, without any effort I might add. It happened like this back in the enlightenment period of crypto before exchanges: I quietly allocated 5% of my net worth to BTC. And by golly, a year later it grew to 20% and I didn't even buy anymore. Then 50%. Now it's 95%. This see, is what happens to companies with BTC on their balance sheets, nation states with it in reserve, individuals, etcetera. There's an asymmetric trade happening globally between fiat and BTC, and I'm pleased you've joined us. 

The *transaction phase* of all this is next. Composability can create some oddities. Consider UBER: they get the location info of a driver/passenger through Google Maps. They send data to driver/passenger through Tulio. They pay the driver through Stripe. These three unrelated companies *compose* to form UBER. Now, that might be a dumbed-down version, but consider the composability of these three factors in regards to BTC:

 - Satoshi Standard

 - P2P scaling solution

 - Law of diminishing returns where a doubling price would require more fiat than the entire M1 supply of western countries

These compose to annihilate volatility and most importantly, eliminate the US dollar peg. That's my vision. From there it's a slow rise to ♾/21M, the infinity symbol of course because new goods and services can always be added to the economy. 

Nation states will lose the ability to levy taxes, and this will lead to even more printing, and the militarization of tax collection agencies. But the vicious loop will make things worse. And government's won't be able to afford enforcement. They'll lose the ability to finance anything projects of value, and these will have to be incentivizing enough to open payment channels ({}).

sam-goodwin,"Yeah well if you want to judge something, it’s usually better to do research instead of writing it off as a failure with no knowledge (which most people on this thread seem to be doing). It’s a deep topic and I didn’t care to explain it while at work. 

Google tokenomics and read about how smart contracts enable developers to construct intricate, virtual economic systems, like banks, market makers, lending protocols, yield farmers, treasuries. Interesting projects include Olympus DAO, Curve Finance, AAVE, Compound Uniswap, etc. Then read about how all these algorithmic financial organizations interact with each other automatically on the blockchain, for example how Curve Finance lends out its investor’s assets on AAVE to earn them a yield. One difference about these organizations is that their profits are distributed to their holders instead of to the bankers - crypto is a bank without an owner (no bankers), so profits belong to all users. This results in higher yields for investors and also more interesting financial incentive structures. One data point is is how you can earn 10% yield on stable coins in Curve - that’s 10% low risk yield on cash. Wont get that from a bank right now. 

There’s too much to explain and I’m not the best person to explain it. Go read about it. It’s a massively important innovation for the world of finance and even beyond.

Step 1 is stopping the decommissioning process and that just happened, plus new ones are getting approved left and right literally all in the last month this has changed. It's a MASSIVE shift and it just happened. You might not have seen the policy shift yet but finance media is all over it. I made 300 grand in uranium miners 2 months ago after watching the first cracks form in the anti-nuclear political bulkhead.

Getdownonyx,"I don’t think that customer service will get better naturally until there’s a plateau in delivery volumes. The issue is that when growing at 50% per year, growth is always the priority and some areas will be behind the curve and not able to keep up. It will probably transfer from different one geographic area to another until they stop growing manufacturing volumes.

With &gt;50% growth, they will basically be doubling the fleet every 1-2 years, and so service will have to scale and overtake manufacturing volumes in a sprint, then settle until deliveries catch up to service capacity, then another area will experience an unplanned rush of deliveries and fall behind until service catches up again, repeat until they start to reach steady state of deliveries and can plan a little more appropriately.

Sobaphoto,"Start with DAI -&gt; deposit into AAVE -&gt; mint camDAI using Mai.finance -&gt; open a MAI vault and mint MAI using the camDAI as collateral (leave LTV at 95% just to be safe)

Now, bridge the MAI to solana using allbridge and exchange MAI for USDC on the Jupiter aggregator 

You can also use MAI-USDT-USDC-DAI pool on polygon curve or polygon balancer, but usually Jupiter has better prices.

Now deposit USDC into the UST pool on mercurial.finance.

Now here is where the magic happens, we are going to leverage that farm. Go to parrot.fi and deposit the receipt tokens and mint PAI using them as collateral. 

If you want to play safe, you can deposit the PAI into mercurial’s PAI pool and end the setup right there (42% + 6% APY). But if you want to go a little further, you can deposit PAI into port finance and borrow USDC or USDT against it (whichever one is cheaper)

Than, deposit into mercurial and mint more PAI. Use PAI as collateral to get more USDC or USDT, deposit into mercurial, mint PAI and repeat.

You can also simply sell the PAI for USDC instead of using port finance to borrow, but you are taking on more risk by doing that. (The advantage of this is that you don’t have to pay borrowing fees)

Once this is all done, you will likely have around 2X-3X leverage, meaning that 20% apr is now 40%-60%, and you also have a 6% bonus from the camDAI at the beginning of the setup

laflammaster,"Holy damn, Criand. Been doing some more research on QES. 

Agreed on lack of data on quantos, but I did find some articles in Applied Mathematical Finance

&gt;Pricing formulae show that the value of a quanto equity swap at the  start   
date  does not depend on the foreign stock price level, but rather  on   
the  term structures of both countries and other parameters. However,    
the  foreign stock price levels do affect the swap value times between    
two  payment dates.

If I were Kenny, I'd do exactly that to last as long as possible. Until such time that we have major swings exchange rates, we may not see much of an impact.

&gt;Simulation  results show that the constant margin rate on average   
declines with the  tenor of the swaps and the magnitude of the constant   
margin rate is  generally smaller than the interest rate differential.   
Among domestic  interest  rate, foreign interest rate, third-country   
interest rate, and  exchange rate, we found that  correlations   
associated with the exchange  rate play a more important role in pricing  
diff swaps than correlations  among interest rates themselves.

Maybe we should have a view on the yield curve more closely.

MrQot,"Yeah, it's kinda wack to see the paradigm shift and all this innovation happening at lightning speed where even the most informed in the space thought stuff like Starkware would be ready in 3-5 years and they end up launching on mainnet (albeit in alpha) literally this month. And zkSync's gonna launch an EVM-compatible zkRollup soon enough, another feat that seems practically impossible.

For now eth fees suck and L2s are not quite there yet to compete with $0.001 fees offered by polygon and other sidechains, but they'll catch up soon and we'll eventually never look back. I'm also a defi degen and I'll gladly use what's currently the cheapest while still basically being an eth maxi long term lol

&gt;Didn't realize that the price curve for scaling was inverse of the norm. 

To be more precise, it's more that the size of proof batches scales logarithmically as the transactions they secure scale exponentially. (i.e. square the number of transactions and you only double the proof size). If/when that kind of global scaling happens, the limitation will become how much data is available to post these proofs, and that's the point of ETH2 sharding!

This little [starkware video](https://twitter.com/StarkWareLtd/status/1456256503157956609) explains the high level stuff well I think. The goal of any blockchain is to agree on transaction validity and state change, and these zk proof mechanisms are just infinitely better than the current model where every node validates everything by running code themselves, instead of instantly checking a single cryptographic proof about the result of arbitrary code execution that was ran by a single node.

The information asymmetry about the upcoming layer 2 ecosystems is crazy, it's probably even a bigger shift to the blockchain space than smart contracts were when eth first launched. Meanwhile crypto fans are still arguing over which L1 chain can scale the most when in reality none of them can. L2 is not just a gimmick!

The possibilities zkRollups open up are so crazy you can literally run an [entire physics engine on-chain](https://twitter.com/guiltygyoza/status/1454657064555499522). This is how we'll get not just decentralized finance, but decentralized *everything*. Think some kind of decentralized social media where submitting a post or upvoting is technically an on-chain transaction but with a cost of a trillionth of penny, so low that it can basically be abstracted away by the rollup while still giving you full sovereignty over your data and identity, *and* burning eth on the base layer for posting the proofs for absolute, immutability finality of transaction results",2021-11-10 12:20:15
2PumpsAndASquirt,"Australian lawyers are being lured to the US and UK in record numbers by the promise of more prestigious work, overseas adventures and salaries that are more than double those offered by domestic firms, recruiters say.

Global talent shortages also mean overseas firms are headhunting Australian lawyers and professionals in growing numbers, and legal eagles with three to six years experience in transactional corporate law are the most in demand.

Local law firms desperate to retain staff are increasingly offering firm-wide pay rises in response, as 20 months of closed borders and pent-up demand for travel have made Australia’s version of “the great resignation” look more like a “great exodus”.

Jonathan Walmsley, owner of legal recruiter Marsden, said he had seen “more Australian lawyers going to the US than ever before” in recent months and this would only grow in the new year as eased border rules “open up a whole new category of lawyers who have been waiting”.

“These are the people who wanted to go over the past two years but waited because of COVID and the border restrictions. I think we’ll see a whole range of new people wanting to go overseas early in the new year,” he said.

The expatriates are driven by pay – junior lawyers in the US often earn more than triple their Australian counterparts – a desire for adventure, and, according to Mr Walmsley, the “prestige” of working in the New York, San Francisco and London markets.

Cutting-edge deals
“Deals in these locations are bigger, more complex, more cutting edge and deal flows can be stronger,” he said.

“Most significant transactions are governed by US or UK law. The work over there is more complex, so junior-mid level lawyers, in particular, enjoy an accelerated learning curve.

“There is also more innovation coming out of those markets in terms of how deals are structured and because of the availability of innovative financial products like NY and London. There is no better place to be a TMT [technology, media and telco] lawyer than San Fran or Silicon Valley.”

Ms Brown said career opportunities were one of the key drivers for lawyers and young professionals to head to the UK.


Deb Brown says Australians want to work in the UK for the travel, lifestyle and career opportunities. 

“One of the key questions we ask people when they’re looking to come over here is what are their drivers? Why are they making the move?” the London-based recruiter said.

“And definitely one of the most popular reasons [is] the access to greater opportunities than they can obtain back home.”

She said “travel and lifestyle” was also another factor, as “what we never fully appreciated” before COVID-19 was how important these drivers were for Australian candidates.

The work is tougher, though, and the hours are longer, and lawyers based in the US and UK say weekend work is the norm and weekday hours are consistently more than those in Australian corporate firms. Anecdotally, the hours are worst in the US.

For some, the combination of higher pay and big bonuses makes the time overseas worth it. A sixth-year lawyer’s salary in the US can be more than what a junior partner would earn at an Australian top-tier firm.

Mr Walmsley estimates that first-year lawyers at top-tier firms in the US earn about $US205,000 ($276,940) plus $US10,000 in bonuses, compared with $90,000 in Australia, with a lockstep progression structure taking that figure to more than $US300,000 in salary and $US50,000 in bonuses by the fifth year. Most US firms also doubled their bonus pools during COVID-19.

Jurisdictional differences
In London, lawyers with two years experience earn about £90,000 ($164,880).

The need to learn about jurisdictional differences in the law and pass the relevant bar means Australian lawyers heading to the US and the UK typically have one to two years shaved off their experience level, however, to allow them “a ramp-up period”.

Australia’s privileged visa arrangements with the US and the UK also added to their appeal for candidates, recruiters said, as they made gaining the right to work relatively easier than in other jurisdictions.

Australians can work in the US for a single employer for two years under an E3 visa, which can be renewed and which Mr Walmsley said was “very easy to get for professionals”.

They can also work in the UK for two years for multiple employers on a youth mobility visa, provided they take it up before they are 35 years old and claim it only once.

Ancestry visas are also popular, giving Commonwealth citizens who have a grandparent who was born in the UK the right to work there for five years.

Mr Walmsley said lawyers with three to six years’ experience were the most in demand, but candidates at varied levels of seniority were likely to find roles in an employees’ market.

This is also the most sought-after level of lawyer in Australia, where an exodus of corporate lawyers to in-house roles has lawyers with two to four years’ experience being described as “unicorns”.

“The most in-demand level is someone with three to six years’ experience from a top-tier firm with strong academics. They’d have a massive amount of choice in terms of firm and location,” Mr Walmsley said.

“But anyone with two years’ plus experience has a very good chance of successfully securing an international role if they have a strong background.”

He said transactional practice groups such as M&amp;A, private equity, investments funds, capital markets, tech transactions, energy and all areas of banking and finance were experiencing the biggest staff shortages globally.",2021-11-10 12:56:55

(Make sure you don't deposit all of your Matic, keep some in your wallet to pay for gas.)  You could stop here and you'd be earning about 2-4% on those funds.  Depositing into Aave will leave you with amTokens, like amWMATIC, and amWETH.  Then deposit these into Mai Finance under the yield tab.  This will leave you with camWMATIC, and camWETH.  You then use these to open up a vault under the Vault tab.  Once you have a vault, you can borrow Mai stablecoin against your vaulted assets at 0% interest.  You can use this Mai to buy other tokens, or deposit them into pools on Quickswap or Balancer, etc.  Or you can swap the Mai for USDC and deposit them into Curve.  You can deposit them into the stablecoin pool, or ever so slightly more risky you can deposit them into the tricrypto pool on Curve, which is what I prefer since im bullish on ETH/BTC right now.

ApprehensiveTrader,"So I’ve reached the next stage in the interview process, and in the meantime I’ve started interview processes for a couple other companies. There is one company (Job2) that would pay what I requested, but truthfully, I feel less confident and somewhat uncomfortable than I do in the job that initially low-balled me. If I get the job (job2) I would take it, as it meets salary expectations and would be a great learning experience where I’d develop skills that would help me throughout my career, but I think the learning curve would result in months of stress and difficulty. I think I could end up not getting job #2 due to lack of directly related experience. 

There is another job (job 3) that low-balled me by sooo much more than the job I posted about, and the recruiter (who spent 20 years in the field prior to becoming a recruiter) explained that my career change will make my job search incredibly difficult with my current salary expectations. Job 1 (OP) and job 3 are very similar, but the recruiter said something about 50-60k for Job3, which is absolutely out of the question. Job1 would be at least 70k, which is ~8% more than I make now (enough to cover public transport and MAYBE utilities, but not nearly enough to cover increase in cost of apartment by any means). He (Job3) kept talking about me changing careers within finance and not having direct experience related to that job. He labeled me as someone between a fresh college grad and a professional with experience in the role/field. I never had a college internship, so maybe he’s not wrong.

Does this change your opinion? Job3 guy is not lying; I’ve learned tons of actuarial-specific skills/software that would not translate over. 

Part of me feels like Job1 provides incredible opportunity to enter the field I’m passionate about, and both interviewers kept referring  to the job as a “stepping stone”.

I will say this: I think compensation for work is a bell curve. On the one side of the curve you have jobs that require minimal knowledge to perform, and therefore pay minimal wages. On the other side of the curve you have people who are well-compensated not because the job itself is difficult, but because the knowledge (ex: licenses, education, network, etc.) they bring to the table cannot be easily replaced. Like that comment about paying an electrician $100 to flip a switch. It's not the act of flipping a switch, it's the years of experience to know *which* switch to flip that you're paying for.\* In the middle you have most folks who are doing more work than the folks on either side of the curve while not being compensated as highly, because they're still in the learning phase.

Experts-say,"Hmm, this is more of a personal opinion than facts I could back up, but I would argue its because of the (current) true nature of ""crypto"". Monero is an amazing tool and very true to the core of what cryptocurrency is supposed to be, however ""Crypto"" (the combination of all coins and tools we see created, traded, and discussed daily) is very little about actual ""cash""/currency transactions. The relevance of privacy is particularly high in this domain, and crypto IS used as such, but that's probably a fairly small (but slowly growing) subset of current use. In my opinion most of it is about speculation / gambling / numbers go up. 

Depending on who you look at, you have the ""poor"" who like it for the rush of gambling and the ability to dream of getting rich, similar to why they like to buy lottery tickets (but probably with slightly better chances). Many of them actually do get some money out, or at least saw their paper-value bell curve for a short time. It's either a great dream, a great gain, or a great story... depending on when you get in and out. You also have the wealthy who like to ""diversify"" (read: ""add gambling"") and spice up their boring portfolios with some excitement, and they will indeed be able to extract significant value out of their ability to bet bigger, patience and staying power. And then you have the really rich, the""institutionals"", and the con-men-type (3 definitely not mutually exclusive categories) who will always attack new un/under-regulated environments with heavy manipulation and exploitation until the environment dies or matures and learns to protect itself (somewhat at least).

Where is Monero in all this? Doing a perfect job as a currency. Keeping you private and safe. Actually being used in very important markets, some of which were the trajectory for BTC in its early days. But Monero is a badger. It doesn't gamble, will not dance on tables when asked, has a ""rational / mature"" community, and will bite when people try to manipulate it. This makes the community and price very stable and grow steady, which again, is a highly desirable feature for a real cryptocurrency. If people are even 1% in it for true cypherpunk ethos and not for numbers go up, they will respect Monero. You however see, this doesn't serve the 3 categories above as well as other coins, because markets are easier to manipulate the dumber its userbase and the more data is available on how that userbase behaves. Queue in every transparent blockchain. 

And now you add that Moneros principles of sound money are rooted in privacy. It's basically and oxymoron to shout out how great Monero is. Its like wanting to show all your friends your invisibility-cloak. It defies the purpose. Mixed with a mature community that gives *less* fucks about NGU...that means less word of mouth marketing. However, don't be mistaken. What happens is that you HEAR less about use, but the use is most definitely there. Transaction counts are repeatedly breaking ATH levels and even in relation to BTC you see [where this is going](https://i.redd.it/ihiiwk6o9zy71.jpg) (courtesy of /u/ichver [here](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=ichver)). 

Now because it is a very good tool, it is also a threat to some big actors, so we likely see some price suppression going on. I would however not concentrate on that as the main reason that it doesn't go in unison with BTC. In my opinion, the main reason is that XMR is less the speculative vehicle of abuse and true market value is a function of utility and real use; it takes its time to grow. Imho, many cryptos aren't worth their market caps. They don't provide value at their respective levels other than as a gambling chip or the argument that it has cost so much to produce (i.e. mine) them...But the argument of scarcity and the hype won't survive forever. Some will survive for their utility (even if its only gambling), others will not. Finance and Crypto are both somewhat out of control with regard to speculative estimation of future value. 

Back to the topic: More and more people are using monero. Its the only digital cash worth its salt and it's the value investment for a diversified portfolio... a long-term stable history might make it massive for both legal and illegal purposes (imagine some country with strong capital controls and massive amount of rich people suddenly has a lot of people flee because of the tightening grip and war mongering of its government... not looking at any particular billion+ country starting with a C... wink wink), and if bad comes to worse you can always spice up your life instead of your portfolio by blowing your XMR in the many markets that are now exclusively using Monero for damn. good. reasons.

take a $50000 MSRP vehicle where inadequate demand exists

one form of subsidy would be a $12500 payment to manufacturers to put towards COGS who would then be able to sell the car at $37500 in line with demand

a $12500 payment to consumers towards the $50000 to shift demand the curve

the nonrefundable tax credit is neither of those

the car manufacturer still bears the entire cost of manufacturing the vehicle and sells the vehicle at $50000

the consumer still has to pay for or finance the vehicle at $50000

later, when the consumer files taxes, they may or may not see their tax liabiliy reduced so they pay less to the government

neither the consumer nor the manufacturer receives any added amount of money relative to the absence of the tax credit, the consumer may have lower future tax liability, but that does not cost the government anything",2021-11-13 01:59:10

LONDON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Shipping companies that transport the world's coal are in the crosshairs of some financial backers who are cleaning up their businesses in the absence of a truly global drive by nations to renounce the dirtiest fossil fuel.

In a sign of investors taking the initiative, six European firms collectively representing over 5% of the estimated annual $16 billion capital financing requirements of the dry bulk industry told Reuters they were either reducing their exposure to vessels that transport coal or were considering doing so.

Such carriers - titanic vessels stretching up to 270 metres (885 ft) long and able to carry hundreds of thousands of tonnes of cargo - are the cheapest way to transport coal and other commodities like iron ore and grain in large quantities.

Swiss Re (SRENH.S) told Reuters that from 2023 it would no longer cover the transport of thermal coal via reinsurance treaties, where it covers a portfolio of insurers' policies. It exited the direct insurance of coal cargoes in 2018.

""There is much more pressure on the insurance companies in terms of ESG,"" said Patrizia Kern-Ferretti, head of marine at Swiss Re Corporate Solutions, referring to the sustainable investment sphere. ""I hear from brokers they are having difficulty placing coal policies in the insurance market,"" she added. ""More and more companies are applying direct guidelines.""

Esben Saxbeck Larsen, senior portfolio manager at Denmark's Danica Pension, said it favoured greener shipping firms as they provided the best risk/return characteristics. The fund has ""close dialogue"" with firms about their ESG strategies.

""If we are uncomfortable with such answers, we will not invest in the company,"" he added, without elaborating on the specifics of the methodology.

Such pressures pose new challenges for the shipping industry, which hitherto largely hasn't been drawn into the centre of the coal debate by policymakers and investors focused on production and consumption rather than transport of the fuel.

Andreas Sohmen-Pao, chairman of BW Group, which operates a diverse fleet including oil and gas tankers, offshore vessels and dry bulk carriers, said ESG pressures on investors and banks – capital providers to the industry – were growing.

""How that plays out in terms of outcome is a different question. Sometimes, people shun a sector and the returns only get better as supply moderates,"" he added.

""Everyone has to do what they think is right. Sometimes, you can have counter-intuitive effects.""

There's good money be made from delivering coal, which broadly accounts for about 30% of cargo volumes and has hit record prices amid a shortage of fuel including natural gas to provide the power needed by a global economy recovering from a pandemic.

And demand beckons for decades to come after major consumers including China and India failed to join a pact to phase out coal power at U.N. climate talks being held in Glasgow this week; while Europe and the United States are retiring coal-fired plants, Asian nations are building almost 200 more. read more

Khalid Hashim, managing director of Precious Shipping (PSL.BK), one of Thailand's largest dry cargo ship owners, said investors should target the consumers and producers of coal.

""All we do is deliver it from the point of origin to the point of consumption, like a messenger delivering his message,"" he added. ""Coming after ship owners seems the easy cop-out route as we have no voice.""

CAPESIZE CARGOES

The six firms that spoke to Reuters about their coal concerns collectively own, finance, insure or reinsure more than $1 billion of capital in the dry bulk industry, based on the estimated value of shipping assets.

Leading shipping financiers more broadly currently provide close to $290 billion of lending to the industry annually, with capital requirements for the dry bulk segment accounting for about $16 billion, according to analyst and Reuters estimates.

The investor pullback, part of a wider shift in the financial industry away from fossil fuels, threatens to drive up the cost of finance and insurance for some shipping firms in the dry bulk sector, which carries close to half of global seaborne cargo volumes.

London-based specialist asset manager Marine Capital, which owns and operates shipping assets on behalf of institutional investors, said it anticipated that funders would not support investments in the largest bulk carriers that typically carry coal, known as capesize vessels.

""When it comes to small bulk carriers below panamax size the amount of coal they carry is relatively modest and our experiences suggest that certainly now institutions would take the view that the relationship with coal is, from their perspective, de minimis,"" said Marine Capital CEO Tony Foster.

Tufton Investment Management, another prominent investor in shipping, said it had been increasingly limiting its exposure to coal carriage, especially thermal coal, since 2018 by favouring charterers less likely to carry the fuel.

""For example we choose agricultural houses over miners and utilities,"" said Paulo Almeida, the chief investment officer.

Separately, at least two major ports are making big shifts; Antwerp has turned its back on coal, for example, while Peel Ports is redeveloping its former Hunterston coal import terminal in Scotland to be able to handle offshore wind, dry docking for ships, aquaculture and the recycling of energy.

'APPLYING LIPSTICK'

Some bulk shipping players are looking to get ahead of the climate curve by refocusing their businesses away from fossil fuels. Others, who have seen patchy profits in recent years, are loathe to the turn away from the returns on offer from coal.

Monaco-based Eneti (NETI.N) is in the former camp, and it has shifted entirely out of dry bulk shipping this year into providing specialist vessels for the offshore wind sector.

""An important consideration when we exited the dry bulk sector was thermal coal,"" managing director David Morant told Reuters, saying trying to clean up coal transportation was ""only applying lipstick"".

""As a publicly-listed company, renewable energy through offshore wind is higher growth, environmentally responsible and attractive to our investor base.""

Similarly Purus Marine, which has leading U.S. investment company Entrust Global as its founding shareholder, says it is focused on more environmentally friendly ocean industries.

""Our business model is to own vessels and maritime infrastructure involved in offshore renewable energy, seafood, ferries and the climate-aligned sectors of industrial shipping,"" said CEO Julian Proctor.

HIGHER SHIPPING PRICES

The impact of higher prices for shipping coal would be felt most in Asia, which consumes 80 percent of global coal supply and is more reliant than elsewhere on coal-fired power.

Even though emissions from burning coal are the single biggest contributor to climate change, the priority for many developing countries is to provide power to a rapidly growing population rather than converting to renewable plants.

An abrupt transition from coal would drive up logistics costs for producers and consumers, said Vuslat Bayoglu, managing director of South African investment firm Menar, which holds stakes in South African thermal coal, anthracite and manganese producers.

""The worst-case scenario is to see countries being plunged into darkness and manufacturing being hit hard, thus heralding a global economic crisis of sort,"" he added. ""This would be highly irresponsible, as many countries are crawling out of long periods of recession and COVID-induced decline.""

professor_jeffjeff,"Ok, the greeks are a series of partial derivatives of a differential equation.  That's it.  So what the fuck does that mean and can I even explain this after drinking 9 beers?  I'll try.  


So like 40 years ago, some smart fuckers created an equation to model option prices.  The equation has a few variables, specifically the stock price, the time to expiration, and something called a brownian distribution that you can think of as fitting the price of the stock to a bell curve (it's not, but think of it that way and the variable ""sigma"" is the same in both equations or at least sorta).  The thing is, you can't solve for the price because sigma, or the volatility, is part of the equation.  However, we actually \*do\* know the price of the option and the stock so if we fuck with the numbers, we can plug those in and actually solve for sigma which is how IV is calculated (there are a few ways so for those of you who are all ""but binomial blah blah blah"" can go fuck yourselves as of right now and come back.  Go ahead, go fuck yourself.  I'll wait.  Let me know when you're done fucking yourself and then try drinking 10 beers (yeah I just got another one) and try to do math and see how you do).  

Anyway, so we have this math equation that does stuff to price options that consists of basically 3 variables.  So what would happen if we were to look at how the effect of those variables changing would fuck with the output of the equation?  This is called a partial derivative, which is a thing that basically takes an equation with multiple variables and says ""fuck all these variables, let's just look at what would happen if we changed one of them and pretended that the others don't change"" or basically something like that.  So for theta, we say ""fuck volatility and fuck the stock price, let's pretend that those literally don't change at all"" and then figure out if those don't change, what happens if we move time either a lot, a little, or whatever.  It turns out that the option price in that case will decrease, but assuming that the stock price, the guaranteed risk-free return or whatever, and the price distribution are exactly the same until the option expires.  Now those things won't actually all happen, but who gives a fuck because we can now get an idea of how theta influences the output of that equation.  Delta is the same, except now we say that time decay is constant and the IV (sigma) is constant so what happens if just the stock price moves?  Well, it does a thing to the option price.  Same with the other first-order greeks.  


Now the other greeks that are second-order such as gamma, charm, vomma (yo' vomma's so fat she sat on the stock and crushed the price but the volatility still went up), etc. are just second-derivatives which means it's the rate of change of the rate of change.  So for example, delta tells you how the option price changes as the stock price changes, but how does delta change?  Delta also changes over time so we can calculate the rate at which delta changes and it turns out that this is gamma.  Same with vomma, which is the rate of change of the IV.  Now, none of these things really mean anything on their own because everything is changing constantly.  However, if one of them makes a huge change then it means fuck-all to the others because the effect of a change in that one variable will outweigh the effects of the others (sorta; I'm vastly simplifying things and I'm also drunk).  Still, this gives us an idea for each greek what's going to happen to the price if just that greek changes, because these are literally partial derivatives of the Black-Scholes equation.  


So what does this mean in practice?  Let's say you sell an option at some strike and some expiration and for the whole life of the option, the stock price stays exactly the fucking same and J-Pow doesn't fuck with interest rates and everything else.  That means that every day, the price is going to get fukt by a certain amount because the chance that the stock is going to move becomes smaller and smaller over time.  Same with sigma (IV); whatever the fuck the stock price does and time decay does, the expected move of the stock remains exactly the same so the odds of it moving in or out of your favor will change because we're still expecting the stock to move or something like that.  Same with delta; if the stock price moves in a particular direction and nothing else happens, then you can predict precisely how fucked or how profitable you are because options give you the right (but not the obligation) to buy/sell the stock at a specific price on or before the expiration, so if the stock goes above your strike price on a call then you can buy at a discount and immediately sell for a profit.  Gamma is kinda like delta because as the stock moves against you then you get more and more fucked over time, just like if the stock moves with you then the poor loser on the other end of your trade gets more and more fucked over time because gamma is the rate of change of the rate of change of the price.

Curve has a dai-usdc-usdt pool that you can provide liquidity to. I'm on the polygon network, I'm assuming this is the aave aDai+aUSDC+aUSDT pool. This pool says it has 7.5% vAPY and around 5% tAPY. Does that mean total of \~13% or does one include the other?

Also, why the ""a""s in front of the tokens? I am lending with aave already, I have amUSDC in my wallet from lending USDC -- is that the same thing? Am I providing USDC to the curve pool or another token?

Providing liquidity to the curve pool gives LP tokens. Take those tokens, deposit them in the beefy finance DAI/USDC/USDT ""Uses: Curve"" pool. This pays out 13.56%. 

Is this in addition to the percentages on curve, or instead of? And what tokens does does it pay out in?

robb17_,"You're right on your assumption about the pool, it is aDai+aUSDC+aUSDT pool and it has a total earn of 13%.

The a in front the token I think is for just to indicate that the token is a wrapper token pegged to the real one.

So, as you said you are providing USDC to the curve pool, actually you can provide DAI or USDC or USDT, just one of the tokens in the pool, curve will equally split the liquidity.

The beefy finance reward is instead of the on curve.
When you deposit the LP token, beefy gives reward in the same LP token, so you will see the LP deposited quantity increasing (because beefy automatically reinvest what you earned, so you deposit liquidity in a pool, earn reward on that pool and beefy automatically use that reward to increase the liquidity in the pool, so increasing the LP token amount).

This has to do with the 14th amendment and it has yet to be addressed and it will put corporations at odds with the federal government when it is addressed.

At odds over who should foot the bill for all this hazard pay, ultimately it should and will come down to tax credits.

however if you're into reading not just for appreciating the beauty of language and go beyond philosophy and imagination. you have an amazing world of non-fictions. basically these are the pre researched works of the authors who invested their better part of life studying the subject in detail and presented their results in a compact package for the world to learn and take advantage of. (i'm not considering plagiarism stuff many of the writers indulge in and simply lift off content from the internet and publish it as a contraception called their book) there's all types of categories where you want to venture, history, business, politics, finance, psychology, even entertainment and self-help the choices are endless.

personality development i'd recommend two books from mark manson, models and subtle art of not giving a fuck (the third one i found it somewhat bummer) since his language is sharp and strike chord with many readers, its interesting. If you're into improving your creative writing skills try - writing badly is easy by amitava kumar you'll develop insights on your reading as well as writing skills. (they both go hand in hand since the more you read 😅 the more sources you know from where to steal)

Masala Labs is another simple to read no nonsense cooking book, its little bit repetitive at parts but there's lots of interesting things to pick and improve your cooking skills at same time, which in turn improves your interpersonal relations and overall makes your life better. Then there are biographies and autobiographies of the people you admire/look forward to. or just interesting personalities. 'Bad Blood','Polyester Prince', 'Elon Musk', 'Pablo Escobar' 'Dongri to Dubai' etc.

and once you've got through all these and consider yourself a voracious reader, start with Russian literature 😂 the dostoevsky and tolstoy!",2021-11-15 04:49:27

NPRjunkieDC,"I put this together with advice I never got but slowly discovered by myself or someone pointed me to .

There are many investment books you can read.

Here's another version:

Stocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My Stock Portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks a month but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 40 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for stocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a cheap stock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies.",2021-11-15 08:20:22

ShareYourIdeaWithMe,"God damn, can you stop going off on tangents and producing these monstrous walls of text that is barely relevant to the point on hand? Seriously, TLDR. You also write in a way that is just a stream of consciousness with no structure to your ideas, making it a head fuck to follow. 

&gt;Price of labour is determined by supply and demand

Yes.

&gt;there is always an oversupply of labour, so the price of unskilled labour is the price that allows reproduction of the labour force, i.e the minimum that allows them to not starve to death

No. This doesn't account for minimum wage, unemployment benefits, savings of the worker, enjoyment of the job (volunteering), learning opportunities gained on the job (internships) - all of which mean that wages can be above or below starvation wages

&gt;average unskilled labourer who already has zero bargaining power

I don't think anyone has zero bargaining power - as long as they have alternatives. Eg. Even a ride share driver can choose between Uber and Lyft. Therefore Uber and Lyft have to compete on rates. In the worst case, unemployment benefits is still an alternative. Starting your own business is another alternative.

&gt;The Phillips curve is correct

I have massive problems with the Phillips curve. Especially in an economy that is deeply integrated with the global market.

I won't go into it here because it's a tangent.

&gt;Not to mention the definition of productivity itself means you can simply pay workers less to make them more ""productive"", because input costs are now less.

The definition of productivity is output per unit of labour (time). Not output per unit of labour (cost).

&gt;The actual reason people move from farms in a fully developed capitalist economy to urban areas is because they are basically fuedal lords and you either subdivide the farm between children until it can no longer compete

This is such a confusion of ideas. There's no rule that says that the land has to be subdivided into many smaller farms. You can just have one large farm owned by multiple shareholders.

&gt;barter economies have never existed

Of course they have. Bartering has been in place for thousands of years before money was invented.

&gt;it developed through conquering and debt peonage, pay your soldiers in a scarce currency you control the supply of and impose taxes on the population so they are forced to sell their social production to soldiers to get coin to pay their taxes, labour was sold for coin to pay taxes and also because it was now required to access to social production

Yes that's *how* they used money, but that's not what gave money (in this case, gold) value. Taxes are not what gives money value. I can think of many currencies that have value but are not taxed. 

Use (aside from trading) isn't nessesary either. Bitcoin doesn't have a use. World of Warcraft gold doesn't have a use. If we had a nuclear apocalypse, we could be trading in bottle caps - no use there either

Money doesn't need to have universal valuation either. World of Warcraft gold is only valuable to people who play that game.

&gt;money has three facets, a unit of account (an IOU, or debt), a token of exchange (a use value), and a store of value (exchange value)

They are the same thing. Miss me with that Marxist terminology. He invented use value and exchange value to try to explain holes in his shitty labour theory of value. Our understanding of economics has moved on from LTV already - see Menger's theory of marginal utility.

&gt;Wrong, fractional reserve banking has existed for as long as banking has existed

Yes but banking isn't as old as money. Therefore you can have money without fractional banking.

Not all money is a promissory note either. I listed many examples above.

&gt;You're just buying a commodity, but what do you want gold **for**?

To trade for something else.

&gt;What happens if tomorrow some country found a buttload of secret gold somewhere?

The value of gold will decrease in accordance with supply and demand.

The currency is not stable, agreed. But that doesn't change what money *is*. Not all money has the same quality. For example tobacco makes a bad currency because it rots. But that doesn't stop people from using it as currency at some point in time.

I'm not sure why you spent so much time dissing gold in your post. My argument isn't contingent on gold being an ideal currency. By using gold I'm simply pointing out that not all money has to be debt based. You can have a perfectly good society that trades in gold coins only with no promissory notes

&gt;Supply of money is not what causes inflation, imagine if banks were giving out mortgage sized loans for people to spend on whatever the hell they want instead of houses, the supply of money does not change between each scenario but one causes skyrocketing inflation and the other doesn't?

If banks were giving out (more) massive loans then the supply of money increases. And hence the inflation is entirely predictable. Even if it was simply larger home loans, it still leads to inflation: inflation would first appear in rising housing prices and then spill into the rest of the economy.

&gt;This was ultimately why the gold standard was abandoned

The real reason gold was abandoned was because the US government wanted to print more money to finance WW2.

&gt;supply of money is actually irrelevant to inflation

Lol, so wrong. If it's so irrelevant to inflation why not just double our money supply? We would all be twice as rich!

&gt;The amount you can probably pay back with interest. The money being able to be paid back is predicated on new money being generated by the capital loaned, but where does new money come from? The banks, debt is being paid with debt. When money is paid back it's destroyed so banks interest rates are to target levels of inflation, if there's too much spending causing high inflation then interest rates go up to destroy money faster and prevent it going into spending. The pie not being fixed means new pie needs to be generated.

Argh what a jumbled mess. You need to read up on how a central bank works.

&gt;The rising of domestic price levels does not necessarily mean your currency is worth less on foreign exchange markets, currency price relative to each other is determined by supply and demand for that currency, 

The value of a currency domestically and internationally is one and the same thing (ignoring arbitrage). Just like how the domestic price for crude oil corresponds with the international price for crude oil (ignoring transport costs and arbitrage). That's because the price is set by total supply and total demand of the good. Total demand is the domestic demand plus international demand.

&gt;if the increase in domestic demand means there's an increase in imports with no corresponding increase in exports that means to make up the trade gap USD must be bought directly, Australian goods are not bought and sold in AUD, we trade in USD, because if USD is bought directly with no increase in demand for AUD then the value of AUD must be continuously inflated relative to USD.

Yes there will be a trade gap and if our trade partners continue to demand payment in USD then yes the value of AUD will decrease relative to USD. But that doesn't contradict what I said before. 

&gt;Domestic prices are related to international markets, the price of oil makes the price of everything else go up, supply of currency has not changed, but there is still inflation.

I never claimed that prices were only determined by the supply of money. The price of oil going up is due to scarcity of oil. Ie. Less goods chasing the same amount of money. The MV=PY formula already explains this: Y decreases and therefore P increases.

&gt;buying a single pre-built house has zero inflationary effect

Of course it would. Housing prices are still prices. 

&gt;rentiers hate it when you destroy their assets through inflation

High inflation isn't just bad for landlords. It's bad for the entire economy as it muddies price information. People are less able to make correct and efficient decisions about the future due to this.

&gt;Economists always had their first principles wrong, that money was simply a token of exchange with some intrinsic quantified value, and projected back on history a false inference of a double coincidence of wants giving rise to a universal token with an intrinsic value equal to all, and with it the ludicrous notion so humanity values gold for some reason

There's nothing universal about gold. It could have easily been another metal - silver or platinum. I don't think any economists ever claimed that there was a universal intrinsic value to gold.

&gt;price of money is the supply and demand of currencies on Forex relative to other currencies, it acts as a commodity, and like every other commodity prices change relative to each other.

Yes. Nothing I've said contradicts this.",2021-11-15 11:37:50

ReasonableSail1363,"&gt; ""Budgeting"" doesn't only have one definition which seems to be the focal point of many of your responses. Many of your responses seem to focus on a very rigid set of percentages that everyone should follow. In a perfect and responsible world, that may be true. In reality, budgets are fluid and cater to individual's/family's needs (or wants). What you may be saving for a trip to Italy, I would be spending on Jeep parts and going to an off-road park for the weekend. You may see my spending as frivolous and ridiculous because you're using your money to see the world which seems more important to you.

I think maybe that's what you're not getting, and maybe I'm communicating wrong.

I have basically no other priorities. I like cars, and want a nice one.

The issue isn't that. It's that I don't see how people can afford to make it happen. Not how they prioritize, but literally how they are able to afford to spend more on a car when they don't actually have more money coming in.

I appreciate that others have different priorities, and celebrate that fact. FIRE people love doing what they do. I dislike it greatly. I never, ever want to be super frugal.

I simply want to do the very minimal responsible amount, while having fun. The minimal amount that every single person does to set themselves up.

&gt; In keeping with the theme of the original question by the OP. 5 years ago, I bought a 20 year old Viper using a 7yr loan for 100% of the vehicle cost (no money down) and my interest rate is 2.3% through my local credit union. My justification...the car was pretty much at the bottom of its depreciation curve so I wouldn't be upside down for more than a few months if any (its actually worth more than I paid for it now). 7 years vs my normal 5 years loan term allowed me to keep the extra ~200/mo in my pocket or invest it. You're probably reading that and pulling your hair out wondering how I could be so irresponsible, but in my head, I weighed my options and came to an educated conclusion on the best path forward for me to get my affordable dream car while I'm young and can enjoy it.

I'm not stressed by it at all. I tend to look at car buying as something simple: you pay the cost of depreciation, not the full cost of the car. Obviously, you have to be able to manage the cash flow until you sell the asset, but over the entire course of ownership, you only pay the depreciation.

I often suggest, as long as you can get a good rate, that you finance/lease for as little as possible, because the whole goal is to own/use the asset without having to spend any money. The idea lease is $0 to use the car for 4 years... but obviously that's not possible, so you try to get as close as you can.

I just honestly, truly don't understand how you do it. How is it actually possible.

I have a superb credit rating (800+ in Canada, which goes up to a max of 900.)

I make a huge amount of money.

But I was just rejected for a basic $30,000 line of credit.

I mean I literally don't understand how people are able to do it. If I can't be approved, surely people with much lower income, more debt, and a target for a car that's not even approvable for a loan would not be approved, right?",2021-11-16 02:58:01

marcuscontagius,"There are legitimate crypto organizations that serve a real purpose or are simply the best version the financial concept they are trying to emulate. Find them the same way you find any other company. There’s a lot and it’s hard to pick out the best in competing industries but  with crypto you have the added advantage that you can see exactly how things work. You can see how much use and what the actual value is for these blockchain orgs/tokens. They don’t need to sell people/investors on things because everyone can simply go and look for the answers they want. No need for picking out fact from fluff on earnings calls or things like that. They say this is the model/protocol, this is how it works, this is how we’re doing…

For projects, you gotta look at the team and how money is made. Read the documentation. If the project can’t make money, what’s the point? Just the same as any company you would look to invest in. 

For chains you have to look at technology, the best chains will get more money to play with by nature of their likely adoption and the value will increase as more folks or organizations find use cases on that particular chain. Certain projects on certain chains will benefit in accordance with this principle.

Curve finance is an interesting place to check out as a project, they are a stable coin exchange and have a good model for profit sharing and pseudo decentralized governance. They do something real as the main stable coin liquidity provider in defi. They exist across many chains and have solid fundamental technology as a decentralized exchange. 

Then you have companies/orgs like abracadabra that offer loans on staked assets. They have a simple business model and an interesting ethos. They are doing what has mostly been a centralized player game (creating stable coin that is actually adopted) via an easily understood loaning/collateral mechanism which is very clever. 

I think right now, stable coins ecosystem is safest to invest in due to its impending regulation and also because that is where it starts for people getting into crypto. You need a way to reliably hold digital assets without the volatility of the chain tokens. I think when you look at the standard savings account interest rate (mine is 0.5% at TD lol) and then compare to virtually any stable coin staking it’s tough not to think it’s wasting away in the bank. 

Of course first things first, use good internet sense, be a skeptic with links or folks offering ‘help’ on the technical side of owning your own crypto if that’s the route you go and do the required reading. 

That’s my two cents. The way this tech is being adopted screams to me that it is here to stay. I don’t mind PayPal or venmo or what have you but there are super transparent blockchains that can match the performance of these private companies in their infancy.",2021-11-16 22:58:07

[The metaverse is still a long time off. Apple is mostly building the hardware for AR (and because of that implicitly VR). Apple is awesome at that, and Apple is awesome at hardware. It's easy to see where Apple leaves room. Look at their current iPhones, how many apps do you use that are of Apple and how many apps do you use that are from any other company? Sure, Apple has some but that's it. In the metaverse, I believe Apple will take a similar approach, which makes Apple mostly a vertically integrated hardware company.  Vertically integrated hardware company: hardware + OS + basic apps + ecosystem  There is definitely competition with Oculus on the hardware side. However, Meta Platforms is a social media company first and foremost and are therefore mostly existing on the software layer. This is the room that Apple leaves to other companies, so there is no competition there. Since there will be competition with Oculus, it means that Meta Platforms will be able to create premium software for AR/VR on the metaverse.  What I think will happen:  * Oculus will compete with Apple on the hardware side. This could produce two possible outcomes (IMO). One outcome that won't happen: there's no way Apple will lose. So the other two outcomes are:    * Oculus will lose and Apple takes all    * Oculus will be its own ecosystem and Apple will be its own ecosystem * The rest of Meta Platforms has virtually no competition on the software side from Apple, besides some utility apps, but Meta Platforms has socially generated content + apps. So Meta Platforms will expand on this and take the cake there.  It may be that Apple royally fucks up though, I do feel that since Jobs died they lost a bit of their magic touch. They're still mostly coasting on Job's awesomeness. I know it wasn't only Jobs, which is why a lot of their magic still remains there, but some of it is lost.  This is also assuming that the metaverse and AR/VR gets big. It may get big, but it also may be a 100 years from now that it gets big since it depends on AI as well, and AI is a finicky beast with all the black box neural nets going on that you can't debug. If AI becomes debugable, then mark my words: that's a new AI revolution that will revolutionize how we use information.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qv6vfa/will_apple_eat_metas_lunch/hkyzlyp/)

readytojet,"I think politics has less to do with it. In fact, outside of old money families, I believe the average registered Democrat has a higher income than the average registered Republican voter. 

I think it has more to do with education and understanding how finances work. I hate how coded financial things are because it makes the learning curve steep and seem less accessible to the masses. Like why 401k, 529, etc. 

At least Roth IRA the IRA stands for individual retirement account. HSA is health savings account, etc. If we used fewer acronyms and numbers and named things exactly what they are to remove ambiguity, (e.g. social security where people are less likely to call is SS unless they are saying SSDI or some) you might just improve access to the system. People don't actually want open access financial education. We all benefit from inequality. We just happen to be the winners. It's a hard pill to swallow.

c24289416,"Hey there,

I see a lot of great advice here, and I hope my information will be helpful to you.

1. I started my career as a CPA and never had any real real estate underwriting experience. I started learning about real estate finance around mid September using Justin Kivel's ""break into CRE"" online courses (I bought ~ 6 of his courses on Udemy during their sales event and spent less than $100). Long story short, I was fortunate to land an capital market analyst position at JLL all thanks to Justin Kivel's courses (it goes without saying.... good interview skills is equally as important). 

2. I never thought about looking for a mentor at this early stage because I know for a fact that I don't know what I don't know, so it doesn't make sense to get a mentor. If you are looking for a mentor just to break into the industry, I would suggest you look on LinkedIn to find someone who is somehow connected to you (via school or similar background) and ask for their advice on how they broke into the profession. 

3. I will be 100% in-person

4. Argus is important for the purpose of underwriting and valuation. It's definitely a plus to learn and get a certificate from them, but it is hella expensive ($1.5k if I am not mistaken). I actually asked the exact same question during my interview because I knew Argus is essential in the underwriting process, and none of them suggested me to spend the money as I will get hands-on experience and learn on the job. Nonetheless, if you don't have any real estate related experience on your resume, I think having the Argus certificate will help you tremendously because it shows that you have taken initiative to learn.    

5. My plan is to learn as much as I can and re-evaluate in 2 years to see if I want to move to the buy side. I know for a fact that buy side is more stable in terms of work-life balance. The only downside on the buy side is that comp is capped. At the end of the day, it depends on how much you value work-life balance, how well your team does (if you end up getting a job at a brokerage), and $$$.

Based on my research, I think CRE brokerage is a great place to kickstart a career in CRE. I am sure next 2 years will be tough for me with a steep learning curve and countless late nights, but I am ready because I know I am genuinely passionate about CRE and the experience will make me a valuable candidate if I want to switch to the buy side in 2 years. 

If I can do it anyone can do it. Best of luck to you.",2021-11-19 15:32:35

FashionBusking,"Risk is entirely subjective and up to the person doing it.

“A 95% loss in this space“ is basically someone who saw some celebrity shilling some rando coin, did zero research, and put all their eggs in one basket all at the same time. Or got suckered into a rug pull.

For an **average** joe, I personally don’t believe the **average** investor should EVER attempt “timing the market”. In any class, especially cryptocurrency. 

(Having said that, there are very “safe”, not-volatile places to invest in crypto, such as Curve finance, certain liquidity pools, and things like Nexus Mutual. But to do well, the investor has to do a some reading and legwork. Not huge gains, but when there are losses, they’re closer to a 10% loss, nowhere near a “95% loss.” They’re manageable losses, not like.. financial-life-destroying losses.)

 If an **average** joe who isn’t knowledgeable and NEW to crypto were to ask me right now how to invest… I would recommend they open a Schwab or Fidelity account, and sock away $200/mo into an ETF, or an exchange traded fund. I wouldn’t advise some risk-averse Newb to plunge into any coin.  
With an ETF, you gain exposure to crypto, indirectly. All the eggs won’t be in ONE basket due to the nature of ETFs. They probably won’t see some kind of spicy HUGE returns, but they’re much less likely to get smacked upside the head by volatility in one coin. By their very nature, ETFs have spread out their eggs into several baskets. Slow growth, but less volatile, and more likely to be consistent.

There's a balance.  People like different things and have different goals in life.  The personal finance guys are hardcore into saving at every opportunity and giving up a lot now for more later.  Others are all about living in the moment and want to experience everything before they get too old.  Others are somewhere in the middle.  It's all about what YOUR priorities are.

Generally speaking no new car is worth it.  The moment you drive it off the lot you take a huge hit to its value and if you're trying to figure out if it'll become a collectors item/appreciate down the line then the answer is almost definitely no.  It's very rare for a car to become something of a collector's item and actually end up worth more, or even what you paid for it new.  You're going to lose money on the car, that's the blunt truth of it.

To get around this, I transfer money to my Kraken account, buy Ripple (because of the low network fees), transfer the Ripple to my Binance and then sell it there for EUR. Far from ideal, but in since October last year I've accumulated more than 2 BNB in cashback which equates to a little more than 1k EUR, so worth it I guess.

Also, since I use a Curve card, I actually buy everything through my main bank's card and sometime throughout the month I will move all those transactions to my Binance card. This way, I can time my BNB cashback a little bit (which is a gamble of course - could be worth more or less than normal) and, in the case of a refund, it would go my main bank instead of Binance.

That 5K loan has effectively negative interest on it. Every year inflation will erase some of it, the dollar value will be the same but it’s purchasing power will be decreased.

hohonana,"Your resume needs a lot of work, but it's workable. It's a life skill. Here are some tips but honestly speaking the learning curve for resume writing is pretty steep. 

* Put work experience first. Your education is pretty obsolete as an adult if you have work experience already. You studied Finance yet you work in retail. That's a red flag, so better not highlight your education. 
* Work experience - grammar mistake right at the beginning. Increased sales by 5% by \[doing what\], resulting in $250,000 in additional sales. 
* Reduced customer turnover by 25%? Do you have proof of this? 
* What exactly did you sell? Furniture or appliances or cars, or SASS?
* For your jobs, tell me about your projects and your initiatives. Not just the base job description. 
* Languages: English, Hindi. Remove Arabic. If you can't use it in a professional setting, I don't care that you know it. 
* Other information: Are you applying for jobs in the US? If yes, then erase this whole section. It's completely irrelevant and actually hurts you. 

Anyways, a lot of work needs to be done. Then you'll be getting interviews on a regular basis. 

One thing you gotta do is **take your target job description and match your resume with it.** You're basically rewriting the employer's job description into your own resume and applying your relevant experience to it. Anything other than that, it's completely useless to the hiring manager, to be honest.",2021-11-21 20:46:53
FblthpLives,"&gt; When there are direct or indirect barriers to that - and limitations on social mobility like for example access to higher education, or a medical disability that prevents you from taking on the challenges of entrepreneurship

For some background, I work as an economic analys and have an MA in economics with a focus on public finance. Literally the greatest limitation on social mobility in the U.S. is access to education. The U.S. is currently in a reinforcing loop where a growing income inequality feeds into better access to education (and healthcare for that matter) to high income earner which furthers the growing income inequality. This is, in fact, harmful to economic growth. This has been studied extensively, for example here:

seamustheseagull,"The problem really was a culture of hiring from within the company, but without providing adequate training. 

About 75% of the staff working in head office had worked up through the ranks. Starting as back packers or till operators or shelf stackers, before getting promoted up to a junior position in head office, and eventually into a job that anywhere else would require a college education. 

A fantastic idea, I don't disparage it. But it needs to be backed up with relevant accredited education; send your staff to college. But it wasn't. In many cases they might get a six-month part-time course, but sometimes there was nothing more than a five day course with a cert at the end. 

And promotions/placements were based more on whether you had been in the company long enough and were liked rather than whether you had an interest or aptitude for the department. 

So you had senior people throughout the company - HR, Finance, IT, Operations - with plenty of company experience but not enough industry qualifications. And some who had no interest in the work. Which worked fine in the 1980s, but not the 2000s. 

The staff were fiercely loyal to the company and to eachother but lacked any ability to forward plan. The company was stuck a decade behind the curve.

Tax cuts reduce government debt
#Assumptions:

* People are rational

* People respond to incentives.

* All savings is consumed in the long run

* The labour markets are sufficiently elastic

#Argument:

Actually, when the government reduces taxes, it stimulates the economy in a way such that the cuts pay for themselves in the long run by complex mathematical analysis. In the short run they increase the deficit.

To finance the deficit, the US government has to take on new debt, which increases US debt.

[This is a chart of debt with time, accounting for tax cuts.](https://imgur.com/a/Am2zss7) The dotted line represents the curve after taxes have been cut. [This graph represents the growth after the tax cuts.](https://imgur.com/a/m2bcyaZ)

As we can see, the tax cuts cause marginal increase in growth rate due to increase in spending and investments. Clearly this growth is not enough to increase tax revenue. That is not the argument of this post.

We use complex analysis to prove that the tax cuts actually reduce debt.

As we can see from graph one, the debt exploded after the tax cuts. It is increasing, and will converge to infinity.

Another series that converges to infinity is the series formed by sequence of natural numbers, ie

1+2+3+4+ . . . . .

Clearly, this series is divergent, but converges to infinity. This is also the Reimann Zeta function at the -1, if we analytically continue the function for all complex numbers. But the value of Reimann Zeta function also happens to be -1/12. [More details in Appendix A]

So the series actually also converges to -1/12. Since it is divergent, and debt is divergent but converges to infinity, we have -

Debt = 1+2+3+ . . . .

ie. Debt converges to -1/12.

So given a sufficiently long value of time T, the tax cuts will actually reduce the US debt.

But I have been applying to any and all roles I think I might even remotely qualify for.

I can't escape this idea (whether valid or not) that I need to get into a tech company doing something similar to what I'm doing now in order to get RSUs or options etc., in order to speed up my FIRE goals. I also have said, and others who are in the industry and know much more than me can correct me, that all these finance and tech jobs are just going to become data analysts/software engineers at some point in the future, eliminating financial analyst type roles. So, maybe I am just trying to get ahead of the curve? I don't really know. I've been doing as much soul-searching as I can in terms of career, goals, values in order to figure things out. I know I want to continue to build my own skills and researching what to do, but I can't help fight this feeling of falling behind or missing out on other opportunities.

Have you ever felt these things early on your career? How did you deal with them? How did you take the next steps at this point in your career to do better in your career, personal life, FIRE goals, etc.? I often feel like I am missing something/falling behind/not happy with where I am.

Just wondering if anyone had similar experiences they might share. Thanks!",2021-11-22 04:18:55
Nickel62,"Should have allocated it better.

No proper Oracle. Chain Link was supposed to arrive in Aug. Still hasn't.
Ergo, Aave won't come.

What you have instead is Tranquil finance. It has a hard time keeping TVL over 50 million. I don't even want to mention the TVL of Curve on Harmony.

Just have a look at the Harmony One ecosystem on Coingecko. DFK is the only decent project with respectable TVL and Marketcap. Rest everything is pretty insignificant. Btw, DFK is going cross -chain to other L1s.

Compare the ecosystem and TVL locked with any of the closest competitor and you will see the stark difference. 

Harmony One announced the 300 million incentive program in early September. Name one project that managed to lock 50 million in TVL(except DFK) since then. I pick this small number in TVL because that's a good indicator of investor confidence in the ecosystem.

Before you say, it's been a little over 2.5 months since the incentives were announced - other L1s like FTM announced their incentive program around the same time. Take a look at their TVL.",2021-11-22 06:32:07

Food security:

This is one of my biggest concerns, especially after reading the Chatham House 2021 Climate Risk Assessment and learning about the long-term unsustainability of industrial agriculture. It only takes a few really bad years like 2018 or 2008-2009 a few years in a row to enter into a global caloric deficit. I have convinced my parents to stock up on a few months worth of food and water (I told them to think of it like health insurance), but I know that this will only be sufficient in the short term. I recently checked out some books from my local library about permaculture, which I think will be my primary food source once I can get some land. One of my concerns about permaculture, however, is the fact that permaculture crops are just as susceptible to failure as crops grown on an industrial scale. I suppose that permaculture has an advantage in that you don't have all of your eggs in the same basket, but I wonder whether even permaculture will be viable in a destabilized climate. This is why I am thinking of stocking up on staple foods and potentially doing some aquaponics so that if an extreme weather event causes crop failure, I have enough diversification such that the event is not terminal and I can recover the next year. I have a bit of experience growing food in my backyard, but I like your idea about joining a co-op to add to my (admittedly limited) knowledge base.

Community:

This is something I have also been thinking a lot about, especially after reading *Sapiens: A Brief History*. Individualism only works when the amount of resources available to be extracted far exceeds the maintenance cost of a society. For the entirety of the Industrial Period, this has been the case. Now, resources are being degraded due to environmental negligence and depleted due to collective shortsightedness. Individualism definitely will not work in a world where resources are more scarce. I am looking into joining existing communities, but I suspect that in the next few years, most eco-villages, communes, etc. will still be heavily reliant on industrial civilization. If I cannot find a sufficiently resilient community, I might just start my own. Some of my friends at school and my brother seem to be interested in off-grid living, so if we all chip in, we could get land for less on an individual basis. In respect to community, I think Deep Adaptation may be better than Industrial Civilization because human beings are evolved to live in tribes, and why so many people miss their college days. However, I am under no illusion that Deep Adaptation is going to be fun. It will just be different.

Skills/Career:

Thank you for the DIY solar resource. That will be very helpful for the THOW. I am planning to do almost everything myself, so labor costs will be low. My brother and a family friend both know a lot about carpentry, so I will consult them about my design. I want to gain more 'making' skills before graduating, but I am kind of swamped with work, school and homework, so I won't have a lot of time (in fact, I am procrastinating on my math homework right now by writing this long response). Right now, the plan is to use modular design principles so that I don't have to plan out everything all at once. I guess that is a complicated way of saying I'll make it up as I go.

For coding, I did not think about asymmetric collapse, but that is a good point. It is an excellent career for earning capital right out of the gate. Although there may be some accelerated pathways towards a career in software engineering, I will probably still do a 4-year university because a) I don't want to disappoint my parents, b) many schools have co-op programs where you can earn up to 70% of normal wages as a Junior and Senior, c) my parents are willing to finance most of the tuition (thanks guys), d) it allows for more career flexibility if I need to change paths later on (be water).

I don't want to be a wage slave forever though, which is why I am also thinking of founding a THOW/sustainable construction company if my initial THOW attempt is successful. I think housing costs will continue to rise into the foreseeable future, and a large portion of the population will be forced to make the choice between voluntarily downsizing or sleeping in a tent on the streets. Demand for cheaper housing will be high.

Coping:

Yeah, it does kind of suck. I also have a lot to be thankful for, though:

\- I live in America, which is not going to be as screwed as the developing countries in the short term.

\- I get to live in an interesting period in history.

\- I am young and do not have as much of a vested interest in the current state of the world than others who have already established their lives/careers. I cannot imagine the anxiety one would feel learning about collapse in a house in the suburbs with 2 kids and a partner. I can also adapt and learn more easily than people older than me.

\- Everybody is going to have to face up to the reality of our situation eventually. I'm just ahead of the curve.

\- If I am not ahead of the curve (I am aware of confirmation bias and biased assimilation) and the world will go on, then that's fine because going off-grid is what I would do even if it wasn't necessary since industrial civilization is really toxic.

\- When you realize how easily everything we know and love can disappear in the blink of an eye, it forces you to never take things for granted.

I have to admit though, it was really difficult at the beginning when I first started to realize how deep the rabbit hole goes. I struggled with depression last summer because of it. What makes things worse is when people try to assure you that everything is going to be just fine. Excessive positivity really is toxic. Or when they say something along the lines of, ""Yes, we are in deep trouble, but there's no point in focusing on how badly we've failed. Let's focus on the solutions rather than trying to live with the consequences of our actions!"" People tell me that I should study hard so that I can become a scientist and save the world, but by the time I've graduated college it will be 2026. We need ""rapid, immediate, large scale reductions in emissions,"" but this species is too short-sighted to implement those measures until it's too late. As far as I'm concerned, my focus should not be on how to save the world (since that's unrealistic), but to make a bad situation better. Incidentally, the same low-tech deep adaptation measures that will need to be implemented have much lower ecological footprints. So it's a win-win.

""These celebrants of 'progress' venerated the brief grandeur, the party time we have been celebrating for two centuries, without thought for the morrow, where everyone was out to jump about, to move and shout louder, to forget all the rest, to forget themselves. They always needed more energy, more objects, speed, control. They needed to have more of everything. Now, for them, it's hangover time: the party's over! Ultimately, modernity will not have died of its postmodern philosophical wounds but because it has run out of energy. And if amphetamines  and antidepressants were the pills of the productivist world, resilience, sobriety and low tech will be the aspirins of the hangover generation.""

Bort_Bortson,"Don't do bonds. Interest rate is basically 0. When interest rates rise bonds go down and being at the bottom there is only one way to go and it ain't lower. That's day 2 of finance, day 1 being the supply and demand curve.

Company X issues bonds at 2% and the value is the face value plus the present value of the annuity of the coupon payments.

Prime rate goes up tomorrow, Company Y issues bonds at 3%. Your vanguard bond has now lost value because why would I buy a bond with interest payments at 2% return when I can get 3%? A $1000 face value bond with 2% interest with 59 payments left is worth less than a $1000 face value bond with 60 3% interest payments left. Answer, by pricing the 2% bond cheaper, hence you lost money.

Going to the 80s when inflation and interest was stupidly high. I buy a 50 year bond at 20% interest. That bond today is worth a ton because if I want to get 20% coupon payment Im going to have to pay for that interest. (Ignoring obviously that the issuer would have bought it back or enacted a buy back provision etc.)

Bonds right now are for orphans and war widows. Though they are better than cash stuffed in a mattress, tbills, cds, and savings accounts so yeah take that 49 basis points high interest savings.",2021-11-22 15:11:38
Stuck-step-sister,"I've been day trading whilst studying at university for the past 3.5 years and about to get into full time trading starting in a couple of weeks once I graduate. I guess I'll answer your questions in dot points in line with the order you asked:

1. Original life plan was to get into corporate to do something related to my degree (finance and economics)
2. Had a friend in high school who introduced me to it, but I didn't actually get started until I entered university 
3. Most appealing part is undoubtedly the money, and the fact that if successful, I would be able to retire early and live life according to my own plans without being restricted by a 9-5
4. In my 2nd year of university I decided this is what I want to do with my life. I had to sacrifice my grades and internships so I could focus all my attention on trading. 
5. As for specific books, the ones that were most influential to me are: ""Market wizards"". ""The new Market Wizards"", ""Trading in the Zone"". As for specific youtube channels, I watched a lot of SMB capital, Live trading by trader tv live, beginner trading. 

The best way to learn in my opinion would be to spend a few weeks just absorbing whatever information you can about day trading on youtube. Then after that, I'd highly suggest just watching the market and seeing live how prices move. Screen time is hands down the most important thing to spend time on if you want to improve. Some key words to search on youtube are: Price action trading, Support and resistance, day trading and volume, Level 2, tape reading. 

One thing that is important to know before you start is to throw away any unrealistic expectations you have of making money from trading because it is a very steep learning curve and it may take anywhere from 2 to 5 years before you truly grasp trading and are able to consistently make money. I went in with the expectation of making a huge sum of money within 1 year and I was immediately humbled by how hard it actually is to learn. Took me 3 years to really know wtf I am doing and gain confidence in my trading. 

To be completely honest, there are some days or even weeks where I just completely burn out and wish that I had never started on this journey in the first place. It's a bumpy road and it is highly likely you will go through many cycles of mild to severe depression. BUT despite all of this, there is nothing else I'd rather be doing as I've slowly learned to love and trust the process. 

If you do decide to embark on this journey than good luck! Hope everything will work out for you.",2021-11-22 20:20:05

CAEatonLaw,"Neither. As an experienced family law attorney, the best advice I can give is that you should focus on a degree in accounting or finance. A vast majority of being a family law attorney involves addressing financial issues (both in divorce and paternity cases). The biggest learning curve I had after law school was learning accounting and business principles. Learning about parenting and children’s issues (call it social issues) was much easier. You don’t really need a political science or law background before law school. I had one. It did not provide me an advantage like I thought it would. Also, law school admissions are starting to give applicants with science and business degrees preference.

Degrees in political science and/or social work will not better prepare you for law school. Frankly, college in general will likely not adequately prepare you for law school. Law school is extremely different.  Generally, my classmates with political science degrees did just as well as classmates with engineering or business degrees. Plus, a knowledge base on financial issues is desired by family law firms, so it will be easier to find a job after law school.

Considering your stage in life, I would caution you about picking a career path now. College can be a very eye opening experience, and law school is an unbelievable time and financial commitment. The same goes for picking a specific practice area. My desired practice area changed many different times throughout law school, and I never wanted to be a family law attorney. Nevertheless, that’s what happened. In my opinion, it’s better to have an open mind. 

Live your dream, but you should be warned that family law is an extremely emotional and taxing area of the law. I am not sure what your motivations are, but I would warn anyone wanting to be a family law attorney of the same thing. If possible, I would recommend that you reach out to a family law attorney in your area and ask them what the practice is like. You may be surprised. Most people do not really understand what we do until they see it in person.

nwz10,"What's investment amount are we looking for to have a shot on the above ?  
Response: It really depends on the APR/APY percentage. Then use your target $500-$1000 to see how much you need to plonk in. Do take note that APR/APYs for DeFi changes.

  
Which optimum platform and effective ways one would require to yield such returns ?  
Response: Do some research on stable/well-established platforms like Pancakeswap, Beefy Finance, Autofarm, Curve etc and see which suits your risk appetite and if you like what you see.  


Is this feasible ?  
Response: Definitely feasible, but to get high returns...most of my friends target the latest and greatest in APR/APY. Sometimes even dipping their feet into degen platforms etc but quickly cashing out once their targets are met.

  
In terms of risk metrics, I don't want crazy stuffs with crazy apr/apy but something really feasible with some work and luck obviously...

PeterFuckingGast,"I think you might have some misunderstandings. When one refers to ""unconstrained liquidity"" it refers to the problem with constant product AMMs such as Uniswap V1, V2 and the large majority of DEXs building on Cardano. The problem, as you highlight, is that liquidity is deposited for the entire price range, which renders most of it idle. When you provide liquidity in one of these DEXs, the formula is pretty much considering all possible trading scenarios on the price range curve as equally possible, which means only a very little amount of capital then you provide is actually being utilised, as most pairs trade within certain ranges. Thats simply whats meant as unconstrained.

Now, thats why Uniswap came up with Uniswap V3. In Uniswap V3, it is you, the user, that decides in which range the pair you provide is gonna be trading (you ""constrain"" it). Then you got stuff like Popsicle finance that optimises that entire process.   


What Maladex wants to do, basically, is the same thing, to give the user the option to deposit the liquidity in the range that they prefer. Regarding the eUTXO architecture, I am no expert here, but I know that with the fragmented model, each fragmented order is an eUTXO, which is more efficient than other models bridging from the account model and that need to include the liquidity pool information in the eUTXO and worry a lot about tx size.

ennuinerdog,"Now is a good time to think about exponential growth.

Obviously investing as much as you can early will lead to exponential growth, as will progressing in your career - these are over-emphasised in personal finance circles.

The other thing that can grow exponentially is your expenses. Lifestyle creep/lifestyle inflation is a real thing. Your stuff is a bit plain and you're tempted to buy nicer things. You now have money, so you buy them. A new baseline has been established and soon you repeat the process. Over a lifetime, this exponential spending on nicer things can really hurt you.

The best way I've found to avoid this is twofold:

1) Decide what is enough, so that you stop wanting more. An old couch and car and a cheap house and second hand goods and cheap hobbies are enough. 
2) Delay purchases and upgrades. Even if something should be replaced, stick with it a bit longer rather than impulsively upgrading or replacing it. In 6 weeks you probably won't even remember your impulse to buy an upgrade - if you do, that's a sign that maybe it really is necessary.

A bit of lifestyle inflation is healthy, but by deciding to be content with enough and delaying acting on the impulse to upgrade, you can bend the lifestyle inflation curve down. Even if you halve the pace of lifestyle inflation, you're making an exponential difference in your lifetime expenses and freeing more money up to invest.",2021-11-24 08:27:21

alphaqu2twice,"&gt;Could you please let me know what value is being generated and how it's not just a speculation market.

A lot of it is speculation today, but this is building a new financial system that's barely 10 years old. It takes time, there are already projects providing financial services and billions of dollars of TVL is locked into them. Curve Finance, Serum, Eth ecosystem, Dot ecosystem etc.

I welcome regulation in crypto space too and I know it will arrive. Crypto needs regulation to thrive so I am not afraid of it.

Stock market is rugpulled and twisted at the whims of whales in wall st. The gamestop fiasco earlier this year is a prime example. Same things happen in Crypto if you put your money in shit projects. DYOR and back solid projects, there are several of them.

Good projects? ETH, SOL, DOT, ADA, LINK, ONE, XTZ, MATIC, LOOPRING, KUSAMA ... I can list many others. These projects have investor backing and solid development teams behind them, I know because I am on one of them. The applications for blockchain are enormous beyond just financial markets. Gaming, NFT, Identity Management, Security and the list goes on and on.

A word of advice, educate yourselves rather than simply parroting the popular narrative. Admittedly, I am biased because I am invested but I see a lot of good technology and work being done. People see cumrockets and moonshots and they think that's all this space is. It isn't.",2021-11-24 20:56:47

Puttix,"Firstly, if you're going to quote me, don't circumcise my statements. 

&gt;Investors or home owners?

Irrelevant. If it's a sought after place to live, it will attract investment, precisely because it will continue to grow or sustain it's value. You cannot stop housing from being an asset class.  Even if you scrapped negative gearing tomorrow, there would still be people investing in property as a store of wealth, particularly as we move into a period of high inflation. Additionally, you don't want it to stop being an asset class, because you will stifle the development of new housing and cause a housing shortage in the near future... (That's a fact backed up by history btw, it's the same reason why rent controls are have perverse outcomes).

&gt;What are the differences between needs of a home owner vs needs of an investor?

Not sure what you're asking here, what do you mean by ""needs"" and who do you think is responsible for providing those needs? I don't perceive this as an issue of ""needs"" but rather financial risk. Both an owner and investor are assuming risk when they purchase a property. It is entirely up to their own discretion whether or not their ""needs"" are catered to when they choose to make that purchase. Perhaps I've misunderstood you, can you clarify what you mean?

&gt;Should both have equal access to property no matter their circumstances, weighted solely to how much money/finance they bring to the table?

When you say ""equal access to property"" are you suggesting property ownership, or state housing programs? If the former, how can everyone have property ownership ""no matter their financial circumstances""? Property will always have to be purchased because it will always have a monetary value and must be purchased. Therefore financial circumstances of the purchasing party will always be relevant. If the latter, we have that in every state. For those who don't qualify but cannot afford to purchase a home, they have the ability to rent within their means.

&gt;How could current markets reflect a disparity of needs being met between these groups when viewed purely through a lens of supply/demand?

""needs being met"" is not a market consideration beyond the effect those ""needs"" have on the demand curve. If people need housing, that puts upward pressure on the demand curve. if investors need ROI or stability, that puts pressure on demand also. If the demand exceeds the supply, there is investment incentive for more housing to be built which eventually puts upward pressure on the supply curve as both investors and home owners choose to build new houses, rather than pay more to buy into established areas that are over capitalised. Additionally, investors may choose to buy into overcapitalised areas in order to create higher density housing developments, if the potential ROI incentive is there. (The clue here is that if you distinctivize  investment, you will hinder new high density development in popular areas). 

&gt;What kind of effects does housing insecurity have on society?

Irrelevant. You're trying to open the door to the idea that all housing should be distributed by the government in some way. We aren't going to agree and I have all of human history on my side and ready to throw at you if you try it on.

&gt;How do investors propose to mitigate the risks they bring into society by introducing greater rates of home insecurity and socio-economic risks that come with that, when home owners reduce that risk?

Your question operates the assumption that you are correct that investors are responsible for increasing rates of home insecurity. Which is not a statement of fact in the slightest. If anything, you want the amount of investment to increase in popular areas, to promote the development of higher density housing in those areas. Something that FHB can't afford to do and something you don't want the government to do. 

&gt;This is a greater issue than supply and demand. We're not trading bananas.

Cute, but no, this is precisely supply and demand. The problem is that supply and demand are not a simple concepts that can be easily managed by government policy or monetary policy... The failure to understand that fact is precisely why the situation is made worse by both of those levers.",2021-11-25 13:02:13

[Yes, but no. They design many of their own chips but they do not own a foundry to make them from scratch.      Tesla designs and develops a bunch of chips. The two you are referencing are the training chips (Dojo) and the inference chips (hardware 3.0/4.0 etc). So training chips are really a bunch of chips all linked together running parallel processing to chunk out large sets of data and generate algorithms for the inference chips to run. The inference chips just run the algorithms. There is no training involved so they can be a lot smaller and purpose-built.   So back to Dojo. It is a bunch of training neural nets to make sense of the world. What tesla is doing is taking it from looking at a single image over and over to making a chip that models and simulates everything around it over time like a video. That means it remembers what it sees from frame to frame and if a car is obscured behind a truck for 30 seconds, it remembers that it was there and does some best guesses as to if it is still there. Effectively they have made computer vision AI that is 4D instead of 2D. It is a big deal. Dojo is also much faster and more powerful than anything else out there. Eventually they will be able to monetize it to third party customers for big data research. They also already have a version 2.0 in the works that will be even faster. They also came up with a new way to store data that makes it 2-4 times faster/smaller by using variables at 8 bit or 16 bit instead of 16 bit and 32 bit. This all means faster and more powerful capabilities to train.  On the inference chips: they design their own chips and are working with Samsung to field hardware 4.0. Hardware 4.0 is probably required for the autonomous taxi due to how much data it has to process. They are currently using both chips in hardware 3.0 to gonkulate data and it was only supposed to be one chip. This means that while they can run FSD on hardware 3.0, it removes the redundancy and could result in failure if either chip craps out. Hardware 4.0 should be designed so that they have 2 cloned neural networks running at the same time as a safety measure. Whenever the NNs disagree then that should get fed back to tesla to figure out why. It could also let them run things more easily on shadow mode.     They also design several other chips for the vehicle. This allows them to update firmware significantly more easily than other OEMs, which is why you saw Tesla less impacted than other auto makers.. but they were still impacted. Tesla should have had enough chips and batteries for Texas and Berlin to come on this summer and were expecting to make up to 1.something million cars and will ""only"" make like 900K this year. The other companies were looking at make less cars than usual and made even less than that due to the chip supply.  When valuing Tesla it ultimate comes down to what is the respectable P/E ratio.. who do you compare them to and is it even fair to compare them to anyone or should you compare single business lines? Tesla is comprised of 17 startups, all of which are at least somewhat successful so far. They will be making as many batteries as the largest manufacturers out there. They will have real-time insurance updates to price in exactly to individual driving behavior. They can charge for 3rd party charging. Their energy storage business is about to S-curve with the latest factory. Their auto-bidder can potentially reap in massive amounts as more systems come in..even if they only charge a fraction of a cent for kWH use. Autonomy is the real known unknown though. It is a trillion+ dollar market that would be pure profit. If you believe humanity survives for than a couple decades then you have to realize we will have autonomy. I think Tesla is poised to capitalize on that the soonest and will get a large chunk of that addressable market. It also blows all valuation models out the window when you have \~40 million teslas on the road in 2030 with potentially $200 recurring revenue per month and robo taxis generating 30-50k each per year.  Back to the P/E though.. if the populace doesn't believe they earn a high multiple then they don't get one.. if they treat Tesla as an AI robotics and energy solution company.. maybe that multiple stays high.   What I will say is that comparing them to OEMs is a fool's errand. OEMs pay billions in advertising, pensions, fines, dividends on products that rapidly depreciate and most have no recurring revenue model outside of maintenance. Dealerships and horizontal integration also kill profits. OEMs have to evolve or they will fail and get bailed out.. which is what will happen. Ford's most profitable piece of income this year was investing in Rivian for $500 million and having that be worth about $14 billion at IPO. They made more money investing in an EV company than making their own products. It's just silly and people that take these OEMs seriously fail to grasp how unwilling they are to change habits, nor can they even do so in some cases. Tesla made enough in energy credits from it's competitors to build 2 giga factories for free.. and oh by the way, because Tesla is so efficient, every dollar invested in CAPEX is 1.4 dollars returned already and will dramatically increase as these new factories come online.](/r/stocks/comments/r0glgs/cathie_woods_arkk_death_spiral/hlxvirl/)

SoundID Reference is on Black Friday sale right now, the headphone only edition typically starts at only $99, so consider spending on the headphone edition as an investment for your mixing along with the headphones.

One thing to double check for when considering some of the nicer open back headphones is the impedance. If it's high, like 300 Ohms plus, then it may sound a bit quieter unless you have a strong audio interface or headphone amplifier to buy to go with it. So if you don't have that level of gear to complement those headphones, may be best to stick with a lower impedance set of cans like the ATH-M50x.

The India Crypto bill: What You Should Know


1. The new rules stated in the bill will discourage marketing and advertising of cryptocurrencies.


2. Out of a total population of 1.4 billion people in India, there are an estimated 15 million to 20 million crypto users. Additionally, that population has total crypto holdings estimated at $5.3 billion.

3. Furthermore, the Reserve Bank of India will likely launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) by December.

4. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated that democratic nations should work together so that crypto “does not end up in wrong hands, which can spoil our youth.”

4. However, those in opposition of the bill believe that if India bans crypto, massive consequences will follow. Among those potential consequences, some believe the country will fall behind the technology curve, miss out on potential blockchain innovations and experience potential brain drain.

5. Additionally, officials from India’s finance ministry are considering a framework that would treat cryptos more like commodities than currencies.

6. Finally, in March 2020, India’s supreme court overturned a blanket ban on crypto imposed by the central bank. However, this new bill may successfully ban all private cryptos.

itsnotrelevantt,"No one else is being helpful so I will chime in... I highly recommend you do some internet research before coming here btw. It doesn't take a lot of googling to learn that Law salaries have what is called a bimodal curve - there are 2 modes. Meaning, the majority of salaries cluster around 2 points and there are very few salaries above, in the middle, or below. One around 60-70k and one around 190+. No, you cannot make in the ""in between range"" (amd have a healthy work life balance) STRAIGHT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL***. If you could, don't you think everyone would go for that instead of Biglaw? This is also why many law schools split up their average salaries to PI and private so you can see real salary medians. 

*Smaller private practice or ""midlaw"" is a possibility straight from law school, but there are a lot less of these positions, most likely start $ lower than you think BECAUSE there's no industry standard like in Biglaw (they're not competing, they usually have a niche in a community) and you'll need community ties or ties to lawyers at those specific firms. Less positions, harder to achieve, and absolutely no guarantee of better hours, every firm is wildly different. 

MOST IMPORTANT TO READ: **More importantly, the in-between in the bimodal curve (90-150ish or maybe even more) is probably attainable for most lawyers outside of Biglaw over the course of their career because in almost every field Law comes with built in salary growth. PDs don't make 60k forever and they will top 100k or maybe even 150k or more depending on how long they stay in the field and where they practice (in my jurisdiction, they make the same salary scale as the DAs!). Government lawyers especially have fast increases. Take a look at state salary scales - they are publicly available for most states. In california it only takes 4-6 years for the average staff attorney to hit $100k. One more note - for most people in Biglaw, they will leave within 2-5 years and if they don't then they'll leave when they dont make partner. The most common exit option is in-house counsels at companies and corporations - many people go into biglaw JUST for these exit options because they are not achievable out of law school for the most part. These jobs are usually starting in that 120k+ ramge you're asking about... people take a pay cut to go into them from big law, but they offer work life balance and specialization. Food for thought.

I say this all the time and no one listens to me, but if you want to make money, don't go into law. Go into finance or something else. If you want to be a lawyer, seriously appraise whether grueling work for a few years to jump ahead in salary is what you really want, or if you'd be happy just being a lawyer and letting your salary grow over time while actually helping people with the law (not to say that Biglaw doesn't have those opportunities, but much less than govt or pi work).",2021-11-27 15:16:23
XquaInTheMoon,"So, honestly there's a bit to learn like real finance, DeFi also has a learning curve. 
I would recommend looking at some videos on YouTube.

But to start, you can create an account on CoinBase/Binance/Crypto.com/Kraken or any other big exchange. 

What happens there is that they'll sell you coins for money, when you have those coins you can then remove them from the exchange to your wallet (kinda like having money at the bank, you can get bills whenever you want). 
You can trust them or not (like a bank) to hold onto your cash 

At minima, just buying the dip and setting a ""goal target"" is a base strategy's that would work (like finance) say you buy a coin for 100$, you set a target at 120$, you sell then (you can also make this automatic) and get 20% profits.

Women are grossly under-represented in every type of investing though.  It’s not limited to the crypto space.  

From what I’ve seen, it seems to come down to a few factors.  Women tend to be more risk-averse, and generally have less disposable income than men.  There’s also a significant time investment required to research any type of investment other than ETFs.  With women carrying a disproportionately high percentage of home management and childcare responsibilities in cishet relationships, the average woman with a partner and kids simply doesn’t have the time to do the necessary learning and research.

Also, for whatever reason, a lot of women just seem to have a total lack of interest in finance and investing.  Someone with limited time and money isn’t going to dedicate already scarce resources to learning about something they have no interest in.",2021-11-28 04:23:31
doinwhatIken,"frankly, there are at least a few interconnected points that can start the process, but the interlocking of them all tends to make it a steep hill to climb. 

Off the top of my head I'd say federally mandated living minimum wage that meets the standard that allows a full time worker to afford a two bedroom, with utilities and and food budget. Funded by taxation that begins negative or at the very least zero at the lowest economiic levels and builds as a proper learning curve does. with the sustainable middle class level being the spot where anything above that requires more work and sacrifice to attain. and Much past the being upper middle class the taxation makes it so that only those who want to prove that they can do it will take the burden of the taxation level.

Also close some of the tax loop holes where somebody can gain a net worth of billions but have the annual pay they receive be small enough that the person can not have to file taxes or file in amounts that are less than their workers. Literally if you are a filing for disability or other benefits in this country you are asked about the value of your car, and any property you might have, as well as stocks or holdings. That needs to be on the plate for these wealth tax loopholes.

Institute a national health care system and state funded educational opportunities that include apprenticeships as accredited degree programs.

Rent controls. And empty property taxing (with allowances for food and forest property) such that we resolve some of this madness that is more than one empty house for every person in this country that is homeless.

Fix campaign finance and eliminate the legal bribery in the US lobbying systems. make any person going into public office have their pay be based on the median of their voters, and their healthcare is the exact same as the populations. Make it service to the people again, not a career path toward wealth.

and subsidize sole proprietor businesses, while cutting loose these massive corporations that build monopolies and have more than 6 million in annual profits earned from other countries (they are no longer just an american company at that point and thus shouldn't be getting subsidized by the US government)",2021-11-28 12:14:28

u/aofjosajops: Keep in mind a large number of 20s fresh out of uni have a **negative** net worth due to their education costs and most won't have as high of paying job as you do, so you're far ahead of the curve.  I doubt you're being literal with the term 'poverty' but just in case you're serious I'd encourage you to look at the US definition of poverty (hint: you're nowhere even near impoverished) at: [https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty/guidance/poverty-measures.html](https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty/guidance/poverty-measures.html)

To answer your question: I don't think ""being rich"" will solve any of your dissatisfaction with your current life, if someone handed you millions tomorrow you'd just move on to posting about how you're rich but still feel like you've failed life somehow and don't know why.  Net worth is a very easy thing to put a number so is probably why you are so focused on it, trying to put a pin on what makes you happy and satisfied is much harder and that is what I think you're having trouble with and need to work on.

My advice would be to take a step back and try to take an objective look at where the sadness is actually coming from, what brings you joy, and how to shift your focus over to doing things you enjoy first.  A 3rd party perspective could help here too (ideally friends or therapist, but whatever is comfy and ideally someone you haven't talked to about this already and **definitely not family**, they're too close and often with too many expectations which are theirs and not yours.)  They key is really to figure out what you enjoy in life first, then work out how to finance that lifestyle second, and at least from what I can read into your posts you still need to do the first step.

As far as ""becoming rich in a few years"", there is no such thing without getting super lucky, otherwise we'd all do it.  I wouldn't worry about getting rich yet; once you work out the happiness thing, as far as FIRE you'll be in good shape with your current career.

FraudCommission,"hi i graduated with a lot of excellent accounting and finance graduates (all of us were under government or petronas scholarship). among us, the careers that we branch out from the mainstream of b4, finance, bank and consulting is quite plenty. Some became youtuber, marketing agent, insurance agent, teacher, bar owner, shop owner etc. you are not bound by your degree. if you want to become a barista, go for it. but do remember, you will have hard time going back to the mainstream as you have forgotten all of the technicalities by then, and it is already a steep learning curve with those technicalities.  Bear in mind, im writing this in a not so serious mode, bear the tone, english and formatting. 

accounting is a shit job. that it the reality, unlike many years ago, during our parent times, it was cushion easy steady job with iron rice bowl. due to the number of accounting graduates everywhere churn out and its ease of access to acquire its qualification, the supply is too much. many corporations still deem ""accounting"" is support function under head office cost, if can reduce then reduce. many other factors, but don't want to go too much into that. i would say similar things happened to engineers, but less pervasive. 

For fresh accounting graduates:
high tier path like CFA and consulting are stressful. 
mid tier path like audit is stressful as well. 
low tier path like yours is repetitive and could be replaced by a well coded PYTHON script.
wildcard path is management trainee, you would need to be cream of the crop among the applicants. very wildcard, no joke. 

so what choices you have? 

in addition to the mainstream from above, i suggest you think about being a teacher (private or public), lecturer etc. good work hours, less stress and more fun.

Breaking down 'too good to be true' Defi rates – where's the money from, is it sustainable, and what's the catch?

Money doesn't just grow on ~~trees~~ blockchains, not even *magic internet money*. And yet some defi applications are offering astronomical rates. For this post, I'll break down three common types of protocols and answer the following questions: *where's the money from? Is it sustainable? And what's the catch?*

# Lending and Borrowing

Examples; Aave, Anchor, Geist, Solend

Typical rates: Less than 10% net

**Where's the money from?** Similar to a bank, users deposit money into the protocol, which is then used by borrowers. To borrow money, users have to pay an interest rate and also deposit collateral into the protocol. The main source of revenue is sourced from the interest borrowers have to pay. Some protocols also stake the collateral that users deposit and earn extra income from that.

**Is it sustainable?** Most lending rates aren't actually that high (2% to 20%) since they are usually balanced out by the borrowing rates at an equivalent rate. So the main question here is, *why are people lending/borrowing?*

Beyond earning deposit fees, people lend because the majority of defi requires users to hold assets that they would otherwise not want to hold.  If a user wanted to use defi while holding the assets that they prefer to hold like BTC and ETH, they would deposit their assets as collateral and borrow against it.

People borrow because they can earn a yield higher than the rate they're paying to borrow. You could for example, borrow a stablecoin at a 10% borrow rate and then deposit the borrowed funds into a stablecoin liquidity pool that earns you 20%. You keep the extra 10%.

**What's the catch?** If you're not borrowing, the rates are oftentimes very low and you're likely better off staking an asset than lending or even using Cefi. For example, the largest lending/borrowing dapps are Aave, Compound, or Cream and they only offer **&lt;3%** for ETH whereas ETH Cefi rates are **\~6%**.

If you are borrowing, there's no bank to hold your hand and no bailouts. If your collateral falls below a certain amount, the protocols deems you ineligible to pay off your loan and you get liquidated. This can happen if the market falls and you're not watching your funds. However, there are protocols that now allow for liquidity-free lending/borrow.

# Liquidity Pools (LPs)

Examples: Uniswap, Curve, Serum, Raydium, TraderJoe, SpookySwap, Quickswap

Typical rates: 20% to 40% net (for stablecoins, BTC, and ETH)

**Where's the money from?** When you use decentralize exchanges (dexes), there are liquidity provider fees that typically charge 0.25% of trades. The trading fee is the main source of income for LPs.

**Is it sustainable?** At its current state, most LPs are not sustainable. While the demand for LPs like ETH-DAI is pretty straightforward, demand for LPs with, sometimes obscure, protocol or farm tokens are not as clear. Oftentimes, they rely on circular dependencies, ie *finance for the sake of finance.*

As an example, let's take a look at how degen yield farming typically happens:

1. Protocols offer a 1,000% rate for FARM-DAI LP providers
2. Higher rates mean higher inflation, which means the value of the FARM token tend to decrease
3. But the high rate creates demand for the FARM token as users have to buy FARM to join the LP
4. The high demand pumps the price of the FARM token and offsets the high inflation
5. But as the LP participants grow, the rates decrease
6. Lower rates cause lower demand, which means prices are no longer getting pumped
7. At some point, the farm reaches a stage where both prices and rates are going down
8. And when that happens, degens who are merely looking for quick money, tend to leave
9. More and more people leaving and selling the token causes the price to drop

For most farms, specifically ""degen farms"", prices spike early making the LP seem more profitable than it actually is and then high inflation does its thing to prices slowly but surely fall. Most users enter and leave farms within 3 days to capture the parabolic price action and high rewards.

Protocols can avoid this by providing a legitimate use case for the FARM token beyond just earning a high yield. For pure LP protocols, the use cases are typically governance, which is not very appealing for retail who couldn't care any less about how some protocols are governed.

**What's the catch?** Even if the LP rates are very high, a drastic enough drop in price can offset the gains earned from the reward rate. This is especially true for users who were late and were not able to accumulate the rewards. This is why it's often recommended to look into the price action and avoid making decisions based off of rates alone.

LPs, specifically low liquidity ones, are also especially vulnerable to whales who can often cause spikes–both in the upside, when buying, and the downside, when selling. And large spikes can cause a domino effect of mass selling and whoever is left holding the bag gets rekt.

Beyond this, impermanent loss (IP) is the most obvious catch. Participating in LPs typically requires you to split your assets meaning you may be exposed to undesired price action. But there are several ways to avoid or mitigate IP such as participating in stablecoin LPs or LPs with relatively low volatility, ie BTC or ETH. In addition, there's a lot of work going into new protocols to limit the impact of impermanent loss.

# Reserve Currencies

Examples: Olympus DAO, Wonderland, KlimaDAO

Typical rates: 6,000% to 8,000% (current)

**Where's the money from?** Reserve currencies are brought at a premium that's worth several magnitudes (8-10x) more than the intrinsic value of the token. New tokens are minted at an extremely high rate and then distributed as a reward to stakers. A combination of selling at a high premium and minting at a high rate leads to the high APYs.

But, similar to how LPs work, high distribution –&gt; high inflation –&gt; lower prices. At the same time, high rates –&gt; high participation –&gt; lower rates. The expectation is for both rewards to slowly decrease to a target rate of 1,000%. The goal is to accumulate long-term participants because long time horizons would ensure that staking rewards eventually offsets price action.

**Is it sustainable?** Under the hood, the economics are designed similar to LPs. But LPs are often subject to the notion of *finance for the sake of finance* because the only product is often the high yields offered. Reserve currencies have a secondary revenue generating product: bonds, which are means for protocols to accumulate their own liquidity. So the question to be asked here is *why is there a demand for bonds?*

Bonds allow for protocol-owned liquidity, seeking to address the aforementioned issues that often make LPs unsustainable. Instead of protocols renting liquidity to mercenary users who come and go looking for the highest yields, bonding allows protocols to own their own liquidity and provide a sense of stability. This reduces the need for protocols to constantly offer unsustainably high rates in order to incentivize users to participate in their LP. In addition, it allows protocols to earn their own LP fees, which can give them another source of revenue.

**What's the catch?** LP protocols actually incur some costs in exchange for partnering with the bonding program of a reserve currency protocol. And while reserve protocols offer users with more incentives to become long-term participants, they can still always exit and sell the LPs. This may the case during volatile swings.

On the user end, buying bonds usually isn't worth it primarily because reserve protocols typically requires users to wait a certain interval (3-7 days, etc.) while holding the LPs. This presents some risks because the LPs can drop in value and, thus, offset the discounts. Additionally, if users buy the reserve currency token directly, they can immediately maximize the staking yields, which are also often higher than the discounts.

Overall, the long-term utility of the reserve protocol hinges on the demand for bonds. Most reserve currencies are still very new so only time will tell moving forward. Beyond questioning the bonds, reserve currencies are still vulnerable to bank runs, however these risks are designed to be mitigated with how the protocol works.

daksh60500,"I can sort of answer this since I’m doing CFA and CS. I’d say these are v different obviously but your motivation matters more in tech, which makes it harder. For example, if money is your primary motivator, then understanding financial statements are hell of a lot easier than doing computer systems or DS&amp;A, simply because the former relates directly to money, and gives a more fundamental understanding of it.

The fields also evolve very differently. In finance, the field is very slow to evolve, but tech is extremely fast (comparing on a macro scale). This means the learning curve in finance is a less steep with age as compared to tech.

In the end though, I’d say your experience in CS is highly dependent on the quality of your teacher, especially since there’s quite a bit to learn.

MajorasButtplug,"I actually believe stablecoin staking is one of the best advantages of DeFi for FIRE people, and use it a good bit. The reason I was interested in this sub actually was because of how many times the main FI sub shit on me just for trying to explain how these work to people. I do think the ridiculously high returns are temporary, but in the sense of there's a limited number of years (so still quite a bit of time) before rates come in line with other options

Compound Finance is a decent example of this. It started out averaging ~10% on USDC/Dai for the first 2ish years for me. Now the protocol has grown, expanded borrowing options and proved itself, and you hardly ever see rates above ~5%. If you were to snoop long enough in my post history you'd find me claiming I believe eventually stablecoin lending will likely end up somewhere around mortgage rates in the long run.

&amp;nbsp;

There are still great options now though, depending on what you're comfortable with. 

* Aave/CF are still decent interest and pretty well proven at this point. 

* Anchor should have a nice rate for a good while since being subsidized by TFL. 

* If you're willing to take a relatively small liquidation risk, you can get ~56% on UST through Abracadabra where you're only liquidated if UST drops to $0.80... During the May dip it de-pegged temporarily to ~$0.93, so $0.80 is pretty safe imo. 

* Curve pools can get you ~15%, at the cost of exposure to USDT

Personally I keep a good bit of my assets in stablecoin lending protocols. So if you have any questions, I *might* be able to answer them.",2021-12-02 04:53:25

Hinting that I am ""slow"" when you are trading in Rams after 3 years is pretty bold considering average depreciation for Rams are about 43% per 5 years which isn't the worst ever but I'd say that depreciation curve is probably a lot steeper at 3 years than at 5. So you are trading in each truck for a tremendous loss, especially if you are selling back to the dealer. I've noticed that people who trade in like this never actually own a vehicle, it's always financed so the bank owns it. People that buy cars with funds in hand never trade in to dealerships because you get robbed and it's really clear when you are talking dollars and not monthly payments which all dealerships hate.

No dealer will give you as much as privately selling your vehicles. I'm sure you don't consider this at the time because they roll it up into a big finance ""package"" and typically only talk about monthly payments ""hey we can keep your payment in the ballpark just give us that old one and look at this shiny plastic wow it's so badass"" and unfortunately most Americans are fooled that easily.

drsikes,"I can’t speak to the public health side of the degree but usually the biggest learning curve I’ve seen with MBAs without a business background is the quantitative side of the MBA, specifically in accounting, economics, and finance. 

At my previous university, if a student didn’t have a business undergrad degree, we would actually require them to take a few undergrad courses in economics and accounting. Not saying this is a universal requirement, but it goes to show the heavy dependence of any business degree, undergrad or masters, on these 2 subject areas. 

If you’re curious about the heavy dependence of accounting and economics, I’ll try to illustrate why. 

Accounting is the absolute language of business which I hate to admit but it’s true. We communicate info about a business through numbers, and accounting gives us a way to standardize that information. 

Economics is not even taught as a business course at some universities but instead as a social science course (which is honestly what it is). It’s a study of how individuals make decisions as either an individual (micro) or an entity (macro). It’s focus on decision making I think is what truly makes it more of a social science than necessarily a business course.

Finance (my specialty) relies on both accounting data and economic ideas to do one thing…make money ;) Of course not all of healthcare is about making money, but projects still need to be evaluated, capital still needs to be raised, and day-to-day operations still needs to be managed so finance is still relevant even for non-profits.

Consistent-Ad-5885,"Yes, the potential yield and low gas fees makes it well worth it. 

Like one of the other comments says, it’s smart to use exchange with polygon native withdrawals. Swap the BTC &amp; ETH to MATIC, and withdraw from the exchange directly to your MetaMask address (selecting MATIC network). Once the Matic is on MetaMask, you can use quickswap to convert the MATIC back to the respective amounts of wBTC and wETH. 

Assuming you want to just hold the coins for a while, you have some options on more ways to earn interest just for holding on the Matic network. You can store the BTC and ETH on Aave, where you’ll earn roughly 2% APY in Matic tokens. This also gives you access to lending and borrowing. 

To earn more APY, you can borrow USDC using the BTC and ETH as collateral, and use this USDC to become a liquidity provider on sites like curve, quickswap, or Mai Finance. Rates on Mai Finance are around 30%, paid out in Qi tokens that can be claimed at any time and used to slowly accumulate more BTC or ETH; whenever you want to exit, just withdraw your initial liquidity deposit and payoff the loan. Just be sure to maintain a good LTV on aave to avoid liquidation — I usually keep my borrow value around 45% my collateral value just to be safe.",2021-12-03 09:46:38

GringoAdvisor,"Biased, conflict-ridden answer: I am a (very unavailable, over capacity, please don't ask) planner. I find this and other finance subs wildly entertaining. Not because everyone here is incompetent (a lot of you are doing great!), but there is an enormous trade of unqualified information, so shit can get interesting.

I say that to intentionally highlight that it's not exactly different on the other side. There are competent and incompetent people everywhere, in every profession. I've had some minor medical issues the past few years, and it's been a reminder that as clients/patients/customers, we all need to do our due diligence on who we are speaking with and make our own judgement calls on who we can trust.

Qualifications and billing strategies aren't the litmus test people think they are. I spoke with a gentleman this week who is a CFP, who came to me for advice on growing his practice, and about 30 minutes into the conversation I realized that he wasn't aware of how distributions on retirement accounts are taxed. He looks great on paper, and has all the right intentions, but ... dumb as a brick. As for AUM vs hourly vs transactional: if someone wants to screw you, their invoicing strategy isn't going to make a lick of difference.

That's not the norm, though. Most of the other professionals I've become close with over the years are high achievers who really want to be the smartest person in the room and who absolutely care and want to help people. That's one end of the bell curve, and those people are worth their weight in gold. They know more than you do (and you, non-OP). The rest aren't necessarily bad actors (yes, those exist on the other end, as they do in *every single profession*), but you might have a harder time justifying the cost and might want to scrutinize that cost a bit further.

So no, they're not that bad, but don't be an idiot and blindly trust just anyone. Interview, ask fair questions (""are you a fiduciary,"" ""what is your process"", ""how much does it cost"", ""how do you keep abreast of changes"", ""based on what I've shared with you do you think this will be worth it *for both of us*"", etc.). Don't be a dick and think you're going in there smarter than everyone else; someone who is good can be as selective as you in who they take on, and no one wants to work with the know-it-all millennial. Make a judgement call. Everyone else's experience is likely either from Googling the question or an anecdotal one-off.",2021-12-03 20:18:16

ChickenSpawner,"I agree with you on pretty much all of your points.

 I know finance right now is a sketchy thing (like most jobs), which is why I'm going in a quantitative direction. All about programming algorithms and comprising huge statistical analyses of data, the programming language we use is somewhat similar to Python. Also very easily transferrable to other fields of Data science. I know it is sort of the culprit behind a lot of disruptive moments going on, but I figure getting ahead of the curve is the best thing I can do as of now. 

I am also 100% with you from the philosophical standpoint - the materialistic world view is a world moot of purpose and from that point of view we really are meat machines. If dead matter is what produces our conscience then we really have no point in living! I find it deeply saddening how that paradigm is actually the dominating worldview at least in our part of the world. The only reason I'm going in the quantitative finance direction is to be able to put myself in a position of full economic independence as fast as possible and because I have a very analytic mind in general, and I believe I can excel in these mathematical fields compared to most of my classmates. However, I truly believe living in the moment and expressing our existence through movement and meditation is the true key to experiencing the joys of life. 

I do a range of stuff from weightlifting to climbing to surfing and martial arts, yoga and meditation and I spend a lot of time just experiencing life, trying to express whatever the conscious drive of our souls are in whatever form I can.

Some people feel they need $1500 in excess cash monthly, others feel they can get by with $200. Commenters also ignore that each person's risk tolerance is different. Not everyone needs to have a large emergency savings fund on the front end of the risk curve, particularly if they're very young in life. Further, you've grounded your housing costs into fixed costs, while your career and income are on an upward trajectory. Most people who purchase a property - particularly their first - have tight finances for the first year or two and it all gets much easier thereafter.

boneywankenobi,"Love this response!  Some notes on it from my perspective:

1) Hadn't seen the Pelican release, it is something that could bring a lot of consistency to certain sectors.  They say operational in 2023, but is that the full fleet or just the first satellites?  I'd say this won't really change their revenue forecast meaningfully until at least 2024-5.  Also, one big thing is most people and companies don't understand SAR.  It's not super intuitive so there will have to be reliance on vendors or the fusion product.  I imagine this will slow revenue growth because the users will need the derivative product rather than the raw more often than not.  I worked with SAR data for about 6 years and while there is power in that data - it does take specific expertise.  TLDR: Overall love to see them doing that, just going to take a while for it to really pay off.

2) Specifically, my work was years before that post and the company has some strong IP in that area.  The reason Planet cared was because we started working with them relatively early (~2016) and they were very invested in finding use cases for their data.  So since we went across sectors (finance, energy, ag, and commodities) it was an opportunity for them to expand their customer base.  Hell, Planet Money even did a podcast series and we were featured (my own part did not air, though I did all the technical research).  The reason it mattered though is because we were trying to do as close to real time measurements of the oil tanks as possible, so one time imagery didn't matter - it was new imagery we needed.  If Planet had done the analytics though, it wouldn't have been nearly as useful since our moat would be greatly reduced.  

Of note from that TDS piece - this is one instance where blind machine learning is kinda dumb.  We know the locations of all the oil tanks, so having an AI find them is pointless (especially with geotagged sat imagery).  And training an AI to get the roof measurements still isn't as good as what I built years ago (&gt;97% accurate) using a more bespoke method that was still quicker than having to label thousands of images.

3) Spatial resolution will be a bigger problem than temporal, and that is legally limited to 25cm right now.... so there isn't a good way around it.  Still room for improvement with Planet however!  The issue though falls into what use cases need frequent, current, and medium resolution imagery.  Tons of use cases can use data from MODIS for instance for free!  For instance, since ag is often done in such large areas, the low resolution imagery is just fine and has been around for a long time.  It will take years to collect enough ground truth data to monitor patterns with the higher resolution data.  Google gives plenty of access to high resolution data that may be a bit stale but not so stale that it's not useful for tons of those applications.  For Planet, one issue is if you need to look at a large scale (say country) the data is very prohibitively expensive for widespread or non-profit use.  Most use cases they have are very small and relatively cheap - but they also don't produce a ton of value for the end user.  We tried to work with customers to enable them to get ahead of the curve.... but there just weren't many opportunities out there to do so.  And that is the heart of my bear thesis.  Sure you can think of 100 possibilities, but I haven't seen the actual prospective users be interested in any meaningful scale.

4) So this depends on how large of swaths of land you want to analyze.  MODIS is better for the very large areas since it has much better spectral resolution and... well it's free with lots of historical data.  Drones aren't for everything, but I can guarantee you almost no company will want to monitor their own construction
with satellites - resolution just isn't good enough.  For ag sure, NVDI is trivial and has been for decades.  But again - free data for large areas.  The ag companies just weren't interested when we talked with them a few years ago.  

5) So Google maps is a great example of why there isn't huge demand actually - it's free.  If you are okay with 6 months of lag (which for pretty much any exploratory project is fine) then there is no reason to buy Planet imagery.  Could other mapping companies enter the space?  Sure, but Google Maps is so dominant with open source tools and free.... how would they thrive?  

6) Hadn't actually seen that to be honest - so that's cool!  There have been other tasking companies out there for a while (Maxar, Airbus being the biggies) so curious how they stack up on pricing.  Likely cheaper but worse resolution (since the others have 30cm now) - though that is not necessarily bad.  

7) And this is why I hope my bearish thesis doesn't work out :)  I'm not anti-Planet, more want to inject some sanity back into the market after the DMY leadership calling it 'Google in 2001' - they are hyping the company so much and my concern is not that it's a *bad* company, rather their projections and hype are quite over the top.  So I legit hope I'm wrong because a lot of good can come from this imagery.  While I have a bear thesis - I don't have any positions in the stock.  May take out some small short swing positions before earnings (just can't see how they'll meet their projections) but that's about all I plan on doing. 

It all comes from having a first hand perspective of the market demand, being deep in the tech, and not how they will suddenly increase CAGR after merger.  But best of luck!  Hope I'm wrong!",2021-12-05 06:24:45

Here’s some practical steps that can help:

1. Figure out your Myers-Briggs type, you can try a free test from 16personalities, truity, mindtools
The reason - it’s for general guidance on your strengths, motivations, weaknesses. Don’t take it literally though. It’s nice though because it provides more than just a number on a bell curve like an IQ test. Also, don’t sign up for anything, just make note of your four letters then check out the profile of that type on the websites then the subreddit.

2. Take the mynextmove career test: https://www.mynextmove.org/explore/ip
It is the BEST test I’ve ever taken that ends up matching exactly what folks were doing. The cool thing is that it splits the careers by education and preparation needed. So you get a full range of careers depending on your own level of effort, no matter your IQ

3. Use both to decide on some things that interest you. The more specialized, the better. If you’re an expert in a specific tool for example, it doesn’t matter what your IQ is, you’ll feel pretty smart when you fix someone else’s problem or have to explain something to a person with no idea. At the end of the day, that’s what you really want from a high IQ, to feel smart. Everything else is based on targeted effort. Don’t try to learn everything, learn one or two things really really well. 

4. There are 3 sources of happiness:

Pleasure - this is fleeting but also the easiest to obtain, examples include having your favorite meal, playing a game with friends, watching a movie that makes you laugh

Mastery - lasts longer as it is related to the feeling of getting better at things. It’s the idea of “flow” where you are so into whatever you’re doing that you forget about time

Purpose - this is the most sustainable source of happiness. If the work you were doing directly reflects your values and the things you care about, no matter how hard your day to day is, you’ll feel this deep sense of contentment since you’ll be proud of yourself and the work you do. So if you love animals and you work at an animal shelter, or you care about the environment so you become a wind turbine tech, or you care about the homeless so you work for habitat for humanity. 


5. Get your finances in order, if you’re living paycheck to paycheck or in debt, you’ll always feel like you’re on the back foot. Check out the leanfire, personal finance, and povertyfinance to give you some good ideas for your situation

I hope this helps and validates your experience as a real thing that happens to people of all IQs. It has way more to do with resources than true inherent intelligence (I’m sure some rich kid with private tutoring would get a higher IQ that doesn’t reflect their true standing)",2021-12-06 04:11:43
Revanchist1,"**The Curve Wars**


**The Battle For High TVL**

DeFi protocols live and die by their Total Value Locked (TVL). The first great war for TVL was the battle of Uniswap and Sushiswap. DeFi summer saw the a plethora of DeFi protocols being launched.  When ChefNomi forked Uniswap to create Sushiswap - they had to incentivize users to deposit their funds on a new platform. After all, an AMM with low TVL will be inefficient for large volume traders trying to swap between coins without high slippage. Sushiswap - which aimed to be a community governed Automatic Market Maker - first incentivized users to stake LP positions from Uniswap on the platform to earn Sushi Tokens. This was done via Liquidity Mining. First used by IDEX (2017) in a very primitive form, then refined in DeFi summer with Synthetix and Compound (2020). After Sushiswap gained enough liquidity, history was made. This was the first time in DeFi History (and in finance history) where a vampire attack was carried to such a large degree. In the space of a week **$1 Billion** was siphoned from Uniswap and into SushiSwap. The Uniswap team could do nothing but watch as Sushiswap took users, liquidity, and trading volume away from their platform. This inevitably led to Uniswap launching their own governance token - UNI.

**Rules Of The Game**

Players in DeFi win by attracting liquidity via offering better yields for users

**Stability In The Curve**

Curve is an AMM for Stablecoins and helps maintain the 1:1 Peg. It is a major building block underpinning all of DeFi. 

*Side note: Curve v2 is aiming to compete with Uniswap and other AMMs.* 

Launched on August 13, 2020 - Curve incentives users depositing stablecoins via liquidity mining of CRV tokens. 

**CRV** can be locked to received **vote escrowed Curve** **(veCRV)** tokens.

veCRV is used to vote in the CurveDAO in return they get boosted rewards from LPing into pools, trading fees from pools, and other things. The important one is having a say in the gauge weight - or how much of the newly minted CRV is distributed to each pool.

Because of how important Curve is to the ecosystem, owning Curve is extremely important for DAOs. 



Curve Docs - 
https://resources.curve.fi/

**Key takeaway: Owning veCRV boosts your yield.**

If a new project is launching a stablecoin, having a say where Curve rewards go will help bootstrap your projects TVL/Liquidity.


**Yearn and the Andre's Foresight**

Yearn Finance was an early user of CRV and player in the Curve War. Yearn launched the backscratcher vault in November of 2020 - a one way vault allowing users to lock curve in exchange for yearn vote escrowed Curve (**yveCRV**). yveCRV gave better yields for users compared to the the regular veCRV so it naturally began accumulating a higher value of locked CRV tokens.


Yearn would then use the veCRV gained to vote in the CurveDAO to boost the incentives given to Yearn's Pools. A positive feedback loop giving Yearn better incentives for users and more Curve tokens.**The Yearn Backscrather vault resulted in a higher TVL**


**In Comes Convex**

As always read the docs for better understanding:

https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/why-convex

Convex allows users to receive the boosted rewards of staking in Curve without locking up/owning any CRV tokens. It accumuklated so much CRV that it overtook Yearns position in just 14 days.

Convex also allows users to instead stake their CRV tokens and recieve a liquid version of veCRV - the Convex Curve Token (**cvxCRV**). 

Since Convex is also a DAO, they also have a voting locked token, vote locked Convex (**vlCVX**) which allows holders to dictate which way the DAO uses its veCRV to vote.


**Bribing**

August of 2021 - After seeing how successful curve rewards were for getting liquidity, Andre Cronje released a platform to bribe veCRV holders to vote certain ways. For example, veCRV owners who vote for Abracadabra will receive a bonus paid out in Spell.

But it gets deeper.

Similar to Bribes, Convex has Votium.

Votium Docs - 
https://docs.votium.app/

Which allows Governance Tokens/DAOs to bribe vlCVX holders to vote a certain way.


**How It Works In Practice**

Look no further than Frax and their fractional-algorithmic stablecoin pools and Abracadabra's MIM. Without increasing their budgets they were able to increase their liquidity compared to the simple direct liquidity mining incentives.


https://twitter.com/crypto_condom/status/1463589085486923778?s=20

&gt;fraxfinance has allocated $839M to the $CRV ecosystem. 
The $2m bribe $FRAX paid to Votium gets paid to voters who vote for their pool. Since FRAX uses their own vlCVX to vote for the FRAX pool, they earn their bribe back + $5 of CRV/CVX rewards for every $1 of bribe spent.



*Sidenote:[ MakerDao has actually started implementing certain aspects of Frax for DAI.](https://twitter.com/samkazemian/status/1455616788050296833?s=20)* It's interesting to see how the builders of DeFi work together to create a better ecosystem. 

**Future of The Curve Wars**

It's not really a Curve War anymore. Yearn and its competitor, StakeDAO, have since conceded to Convex. Yearn recently began delegating its veCRV to convex to achieve higher yields.

However since the DeFi 2.0 system has emerged this year. Tokemak uses a similar mechanism to Curve. Owners of Tokemak token are able to direct liquidity to different pools. 

TOKE may play a big part in getting Liquidity for new Tokens.

[Here is an interesting post from the Tokemak Team regarding the future of DAOs](https://medium.com/tokemak/the-evolution-of-daos-1692509bbb41)


The Idea of ""Protocol Owned Liquidity"" is a massive leap forward in Dao Tokenomics and was pioneered by OlympusDAO. They have already entered the Curve War battlefield by accepting CVX in exchange for OHM Bonds and are launching a new Branch - Redacted Cartel - in order to get a larger CRV ownership.

[A podcast with 0xSami concerning a new branch of OlympusDao - RedactedCartel.](https://rss.com/podcasts/agorapod/333233/)



**Value of Liquidity Directing Tokens**

CRV, CVX, and TOKE, are all important in the DeFi ecosystem. It's obvious that DAOs owning these tokens will be important in the future. And DeFi 2.0, for the most part, seems to be concerned with the interactions between DAOs as opposed to regular folks. 

I just thought it would be interesting to give a little post about the developments of **The Curve War** and who the future players may be.",2021-12-06 06:43:58

RossLedehrman,"Hi, 

Not sure if you are from a US or UK background but ESG financing (or anything around it, risk, modelling) is in its baby steps. And jobs (all areas) are widely acceptable and hiring. 

My first two thoughts are the following;

1) regulators will impose ESG related risk on banks who impose systemic risk to the economy. This is a fact, i'm not pulling this out of my ass. 

You can already fully read up on all this information regulators are thinking/imposing on banks such as the following;

[https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/climate-change](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/climate-change)

2) in the meantime - banks are aware that 'new environmental metrics' will be imposed - and they are currently modelling potential metrics that could assist the regulator for a more homogenous approach when they compare ESG like-for-like comparing. For example - I am working on a machine learning algorithm that predicts c02 emissions per country on a daily basis - to ensure that liquidity management (funding/financing) remains 'as green' as possible - as long term structured finance (the government bonds) from X country are nothing else but a 'loan' to a country who perhaps might not be so good with the environment than country Y. If so - a metric can be imposed and as bank you can switch your bond from X to Y. This to ensure that you as firm/bank/whatever 'remain as green' as possible - while ensuring that 'risk' is not impaired. 

A lot of this information is already anticipated in #2022, especially for ICAAP related roles. 

So tl;dr

1) regulators

2) banks

have plenty of ESG related roles (from risk, modelling, financing, etc) 

there is plenty of neutral, unbiased information on these websites (ignore the wide internet, go to the source, the bank or the regulators) and read about this

and start applying. You'll be ahead of the curve.

I've been in banking (on and off0 for over 20 years, and ESG is literally in its infancy.

chuck_portis,"Bro, they're not ""giving"" anyone anything.  The only way to participate is to invest in EGLD and/or MEX.  If they didn't provide the boosted rewards for liquidity, they would have nobody using the Maiar DEX.  It's not a useful product on its own.  There's tons of DEX'es out there with hundreds of coins, working Bridges, high APR's, on more proven and established networks.

They aren't providing the Boost out of charity.  They are trying to remain competitive with other similar products which are superior in functionality and longevity.  They are showing up with an incomplete product (with bugs to boot) and they managed to attract $2B in TVL.  That's entirely from the Boost.  

It's not like anyone is getting in on the ground floor of $MEX.  It's valued at $2B market cap, which is more than Curve Finance / 1Inch / Compound.  These are all extremely established projects with huge TVL and longevity.  No sane person would invest in the MEX token at these prices.  That's why people were selling so heavily, because the team was inflating the value of MEX to make the rewards appear higher.

Now you have LKMEX and it's showing you 1000% APR, 3% a day, whatever.  Truth is, these APR's are nonsense if you can't sell the token.",2021-12-07 04:36:48
AZComrade420,"I can't find a job because I have no references from the past 5 years.  I was fired from my last two jobs during the pandemic and before that I broke contract as an educator by leaving mid-school-year due to my health after having been in the profession about 3 and a half years.

I left public education because I couldn't handle the pressure of being evaluated as an effective teacher when my classroom was dangerously underfunded (no fire extinguisher in the science lab with students with school records of starting fires!). My students were facing poverty at best and homelessness at worst and I was making less money as a certified teacher than I did as a long term substitute in another school district. My health declined and I left the profession.  I found work as a math instructor and eventually became the center director of the tutoring center.  I was in the job for roughly a year and a half. Then COVID-19 hit.

I started wearing a mask and gloves and implemented sanitization procedures without previous direction and anxiously awaited the shutdown and the ""13 Days to Flatten the Curve.""  As someone who taught children the importance of the ability to read a graph I was sincerely hoping we were going to take this seriously.

Somehow we were deemed ""essential workers"" despite all other educational facilities being closed at the time. We tried transitioning to online tutoring but the internet was too unstable at my location (even though I had been complaining about spotty internet since I had accepted the promotion the year before).  I was asked to integrate with another tutoring center on the other side of town so I was no longer able to walk to work. The tutoring center was crowded with more employees than the CDC was allowing at a time and my boss and the other center directors were not only not wearing masks but were telling our tutors not to wear masks ""as it makes it difficult to hear and the children can't see you smiling."" The panic attacks came back.

On my day off they told me to go wait for the Cox guy who was going to fix the internet at my center.  They showed up and fired me for my job performance.  A year and a half of work experience gone because the uneducated small business tyrant who owned the math center didn't want to follow CDC guidelines.  
I left education during the pandemic and headed for the ""green rush"" at new shop was opening and was biking distance from my home.  As we were an alternative health facility serving immunocompromised patients I felt comfortable with the procedures and precautions and we were reassured that the COVID-19 protections would be implemented ""until the end of the pandemic."" These company policies lasted through the end of the year.  They also stated they would notify employees if someone on your shift was exposed to COVID-19 for the purposes of contact tracing and testing.  This wasn't the only thing they lied about.

We were promised performance pay and evaluations by the CEO during orientation for our $1M/90day goal which we never received despite earning roughly $1.6M in the first three months. When we were acquired by a new company for roughly $85M and we started receiving company emails from our new corporate offices located on the 27th floor of the IBM building on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, I made a remark to my coworkers about I felt like a worthless idiot working for a bunch of MadMen who all think they're so smart and successful because they get away with lying about sales goals and paying their workers minimum wage (despite the majority of us having college degrees!!).  Despite gaining roughly a year of experience in customer service, cash handling, sales, inventory management, as well as state compliance at a job that requires you to be ""highly proficient"" in math (pun intended), my $500,000 in sales in 10 months counts for nothing.

I figured with my customer service, cash handling, and compliance experience I could start working in banking or finance (I know, I know, I'm philosophically dead, please don't hurt me) but because of my employment record I cannot find a work that will cover my house payment.

I was thinking of going back to graduate school for yet another worthless degree that I will once again fail to monetize and will provide me absolutely zero return on investment, but jokes on me because I don't even have three professional references at this point.",2021-12-07 06:06:23
slumberpartysis1,"Pros:
Mental health
Freedom to work a lot or not at all
No shitty co-workers or bosses
Making your own schedule
Everyday is technically different so it's not repetitive per se
You can spend time learning things while driving and in between orders.


Cons
Sitting for long periods of time
More likely to get in to an accident and die
Pay fluctuates even if you work a lot
?wear and tear?


Tips for anyone looking at this for full time work. 

Treat it like it's a company. Not like a job. You have no job security. If your company stops getting orders or you are a bad business. You will go out of business. 

Test out your area for at least two weeks to make sure it's worth it before quitting your job. I suggest a month

You need to save constantly. Just because you can have your pay any day you want doesn't mean you need to spend it. 

DO NOT. Finance or do this seriously in a financed vehicle. If you don't have a junk car and only have a financed vehicle save until you can afford a junker. There is 0 reason to have a nice car for delivering food.better gas mileage is a perk but people don't understand it plateaus at a certain point. If you finance a great car. your gas savings WILL NOT out perform the amount of money depreciation is going to make you lose. I put ? Around wear and tear because it does matter as a con but not nearly as much when you can fix a junker with YouTube and the car is at the end of its depreciation curve.

Learn how to make simple repairs. Brakes and rotors. Spark plugs. Coils. Valve cover gasket. Just simple things. 

If you struggle in normal work environments like I do. Delivering food might be a good alternative. It's helped immensely with my mental health. 

Sign up for all the apps (ue GH DD). Never just rely on one. If something happens to your DD account you always have a back up GH or something 

That's really it.",2021-12-07 08:58:06
RLutz,"There's already so many replies here that I think I'm probably wasting my time, but I did want to give my two cents as someone who has an extensive background in traditional software engineering but has recently moved into the Blockchain space. Some background on me, professionally, I've spent the last decade or so working for a bunch of different Fortune top 50 companies, I started my own consulting business, primarily solving interesting problems with what is now considered more traditional distributed microservices. Not to brag, but most of the times I would go join a new team, or consult at a new company, it was immediately clear that I was one of, if not the strongest engineer on the team. Granted, these weren't FAANG companies, but I did work for multiple top 50 companies in the US.

Today, I work for a Blockchain company filled with former FAANG engineers. For the first time in my career of 13+ years, I feel maybe slightly above average at best. I went into this place thinking crypto was an interesting novelty; one that I've dabbled in over the past 6 years or so doing a bit of mining, bit of investing, but mostly I thought it was just that, an interesting novelty. My thoughts on the currency aspect of Blockchain are actually largely unchanged. A deflationary currency is a bad currency, though it is possible that it makes a decent store of wealth for folks in places where it's difficult to accrue wealth.

That said, it is now my opinion, and the opinion of a lot of the former Google/Amazon engineers I work with, that although the currency aspect is what is currently keeping the lights on, that Blockchain itself is about to change the world. The folks who *really* understand Blockchain don't care that much about the currency aspect of the game but are entirely convinced that things like DeFi are about to completely change the world, and after two months or so working here, I am convinced as well--and I'm not some insufferable crypto bro, I'm a dude that just wrote business software.

Imagine a world where you don't need banks to give loans. A world where you don't need Wall St to engage in stock trade. A world where the traditional mortgage industry is made largely irrelevant. [This is the world that DeFi promises.](https://defieducation.substack.com/p/decentralized-finance-the-high-level)

If I had to summarize my Blockchain journey so far it would be like this. Originally, I thought cryptocurrency was a novel pseudo-Ponzi scheme and that Blockchain had a few very niche applications where it might actually be useful. Today, my view is that the currency aspect of Blockchain is largely a ""who cares?"" sort of thing. I liken Blockchain to the creation of ARPANET. Bitcoin was just the first step, essentially laying the foundation, similar to ARPANET, and now the things being built on top of it are akin to Amazon.com--you couldn't have hoped to build something like Amazon without the invention of the foundational Internet technology, and similarly, you couldn't have built up DeFi platforms that allow for loans without banks, stock trades without Wall St, and easy IPO's for everyone without Blockchain. There is a real power in being able to run code on a decentralized Blockchain where no one can alter your code and everyone agrees on what has happened and what the outcome should be (smart contracts).

I guess I'll leave you with this. There were folks when I was a kid saying the Internet was a stupid novelty. Those people, in retrospect, should have invested, or at the least, should have learned more about the Internet, because **eventually they had no choice but to utilize it.** I now fully believe Web 3 is the same. You might as well learn about it and get ahead of the curve because at some point in the near to distant future you will have no choice but to interact with it. NFT's are a meme, cryptocurrency is currently at best a way to store wealth, but DeFi and smart contracts will fundamentally change the world.",2021-12-07 22:05:08
xDenimBoilerx,"Gotcha, not disappointed at all. I'm not sure I want to keep messing with swing trading, was just experimenting with small amounts :)

hakapes,"Encouraging, thanks for the info and the time. I am happy to follow up with the linked guides, good homework for the rest of the week.

I staked coins both in the CDC App for the card (180 days), Earn (90 days), in the DeFi Wallet (28 days unbonding) and in the Exchange to optimise a bit the fees (180 days).

In all fairness, for a newcomer like me, the journey is quite a steep learning curve.

I started with the CDC Visa Card.

Learning the app was a stretch. I remember when I googled Fiat, and started to understand what is going on and how.

Then I learned the CDC Exchange, look into fees, convert to USDC first in the app and then buy CRO in the exchange. Now I make limit orders to optimise the cost.

After 3-4 months, finally I started to use the CDC Defi Wallet. 

Then in the Defi Wallet, using dApps was again a stretch. I got as far as the VVS vaults.

Because Beefy is there, after a week or two, I decided to look into Beefy.

Now, Crystl Finance is another hop.

My message is that ease of use and user accessibility is quite a journey for anything here.

If you could be at least on the list of dApps of CDC Defi, that would make it much easier to onboard people.",2021-12-08 00:51:30
no-nonsense-crypto,"This isn't the first time a project has tried basically this method, and I'm not convinced it actually is all that great. There are a few problems with it:

1. People holding $PNG are just hangers-on providing no value to this system. I guess that's great if you're a $PNG holder, but if you're a user of the Pangolin trading platform, you've gotta ask yourself, why am I paying a fee to these random people who aren't giving me anything? As a trader, paying a fee to the liquidity provider makes sense, but paying a fee to the $PNG stakers? Why?
2. Okay, so let's say I decide to be a $PNG holder. Why should I have to stake to receive benefits? Does anyone actually benefit if I stake, rather than just holding $PNG? What's the purpose? You can argue that staking makes the implementation of the distribution easier, but there's an even easier way: just burn the coins you bought back. It works like this: Let's say there are 1million of a coin (let's call it CCC) with a market cap of $1 million, so each coin is worth one dollar, and you have 100,000 of that coin you want to distribute to holders. A holder with 200,000CCC will receive 22,222CCC from the 100,000CCC you're distributing, so their total value is now 222,222CCC, which is worth $222,222. If, instead, you just burn the 100,000CCC, the market cap stays the same, so the value of the coin goes up: the person with 200,000CCC now has 200,000/900,000 of the market cap insteead of 200,000/1million of the market cap, so their coins are now worth $1.1111111 each, so their total value is now $222,222. The point is, burning is a much simpler mechanism, that distributes to all holders. Of course, if you want to incentivize staking, distributing the coins to stakers and excluding holders who don't stake is different from burning. But... why do we want to do that? Stakers aren't contributing anything more than other holders, so why do they deserve more?
3. Buying back and distributing profits creates buy pressure, but there's a good chance that it just creates just as much sell pressure. If I have 100 $PNG staked, and I get 10 $PNG in staking rewards each month, what's stopping me from just treating those rewards as income and selling them immediately? Some percentage of users will always do this. Of course, if you burn instead of distributing buybacks, users can effectively do the same thing by calculating out a dollar-cost-average sell each month, but that's harder to calculate and fewer users will do it, in theory.

This isn't hypothetical at this point: [Sushi](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sushi) and [QuickSwap](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/quickswap) has exactly the same mechanism for staking SUSHI as xSUSHI and QUICK as dQUICK, and if you calculate it out, both coins' price have deteriorated enough that you've lost money since the ATH, even if you include staking rewards. [Beefy](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/beefy-finance) has a similar mechanism, with the same result. I think at this point we can conclusively say that this mechanism doesn't work.

More fundamentally for exchanges like Sushi, QuickSwap and Pangolin, there's a basic catch-22 that needs to be solved:

1. On the one hand, if you don't give competitive rewards for providing liquidity to important pairs, liquidity providers will go elsewhere, and traders will follow since they need the liquidity.
2. On the other hand, if the only means you have of giving competitive rewards for providing liquidity is continuously minting a coin and giving it out to farmers, your coin will be diluted, and lose value. Ultimately this will result in you not being able to give competitive rewards.

Ultimately, this is a sustainability issue: none of the major AMMs have figured out a way to break this cycle. Curve might seem like an exception because the 4-year lock on CRV as veCRV is demonstrably causing people to lock up CRV, but this is only really a delay tactic. Without giving away too much information, I think that DFYN does have a solution which they haven't shared publicly yet (and I'm not going to share it either).",2021-12-08 01:12:31
deong,"Here's the thing you're missing. At a large company, jobs don't get posted by having the hiring manager write up a description and post in on the web site.

When I want to hire someone, my first step is to fill out a requisition form for our Talent Acquisition group. That form has several standard canned text options that could basically describe anything between ""janitor"" and ""chief marketing officer"". Think of how many jobs you've seen that say you might need to occasionally lift up to 10 pounds.

That form also contains a set of titles and corresponding pay grades that I can choose from. Am I hiring a Data Engineer or a Software Engineer? Is it a Senior Data Engineer or a Lead Data Engineer? Each of those titles has a document that describes the typical skills and experience needed as well as what the responsibilities of the job are. Those descriptions have been written by 40 people over the course of a year in meeting after meeting after meeting with the goal that HR can look across other companies of similar sizes, in similar industries, in your geographical area, etc., to calibrate salary ranges so that they know they're paying competitive wages in accordance with their hiring goals. 

I, as a director, care very little about any of that. I have a team that is down a person, and I want to find the best person I can to make my team as strong as possible. I do have a P&amp;L to manage, so I don't want to pay twice the going rate, but otherwise, I simply don't care if the candidate has 4 years experience in Python or 6. I care that they look like they're a good Python programmer that I can hire within my budget. But I'm just operating within that system. I have $X of dollars I can spend, and that lets me hire a Senior Software Engineer, so that's what I aim for. If I get a great candidate who is way off the experience requirements, I might hire them anyway at a junior level and save some of the money. If I find an amazing candidate who wants more than I can pay, I might go back to my finance team and see if I can find enough extra money to convert my open position to a Lead and offer them that instead.

That's the way everyone should treat job postings. They're a standardized form that is supposed to cover the fat part of the curve. I've never known anyone who used them as a completely prescriptive filter, as in, ""this candidate looks great, but they only have 3 years experience and we want 4"".",2021-12-08 01:58:45
WhatnotSoforth,"I'm currently working on a trading platform for RobinHood using R. Still stuck on the data wrangling stuff, handling tapes has so far been the biggest struggle. I'm writing the method to preferentially pull from a SQLite database, and if the tape does not exist there it will pull from RobinHood and/or from Yahoo with quantmod. This way I can use a generic function with a local cache as speedup, with the added benefit of seamless data pull for things that have not hit the cache yet. Once I finish that I can start on analysis tools, which will help me trade manually. Backtesting comes next, then orders. That pretty much wraps it up, and then I get to write a shiny app for it!

I chose R because it feels much more robust than python, imo. Very much a *""what you expect to happen usually happens the way you think it should""* in such a way that is great for rapid prototyping and first-shot success. Python isn't bad for QF, I just personally don't like it. A skilled python programmer would be miles ahead of me by now.

The learning curve for R is somewhat steep, but it's an insanely powerful language, and it's worth learning how to code in it well because it writes out so generic that you just become a better programmer in general as a side benefit. The best part is that boilerplate code tends to be minimal and the resulting code is therefore very readable and concise. Statements tend to be very ""meaningful.""

M0n0Zer0,"Generally, most, if not all people argue not from a place of logic but from their moral intuitions. Logic and reason can be employed to reinforce moral intuitions and prop up a false sense of legitimacy, because the intuitions are their premises. The danger becomes when you are so convinced your moral intutions are based in reality that you are unable to entertain the idea that you might be wrong.  


The reason why people fail to convince others is because they don't really listen to their opponents or entertain the idea that their own ideas about the world may be incomplete.   


Very few people have actual, factual conversations about topics in which they are well versed to the level of expertise. They take the word of people they trust because they articulate their own intuitions about how the world works.   


Often, people from different political perspectives will have areas in which their sight is clearer than others, even if the rhetoric is allegorical or not literally true - it's possible, for example, that the conspiracy rhetoric of anti-vaxers or QAnon types or David Icke loons can reveal greater truths about the general operation of power if taken not as facts, but as metaphors.   


It's easy to see parallels between some of the conspiracies and some of the observations by (Economist and Ex-Greece Finance Minister) Varoufakis about how we've already moved to Techno Feudalism - and how the conspiracists anxieties and fears are ahead of the curve when it comes to seeing how this new paradigm is affecting us. 

This doesn't mean accepting what a conspiracist (or a right wing ideologue or a class-first socialist or anyone who thinks differently to you) says, but it does mean interrogating it to see if it's a symptom of something that you haven't yet considered.

If your primed to reject everything they say then your own view of reality may be stymied.   


We're living through a time of widespread mistrust of political institutions and our knowledge generating systems. The political tribes are symptoms of the breakdown of economic, social and political systems. We need to rebuild that trust - and that will never come from monstering. The more social trust we have with each other the less space there is for extremism and hate.  


We have to have conversations, not with the primary motive of changing other people's minds (although this can happen), but challenging our own beliefs and testing where we're right and where we're wrong.",2021-12-08 06:27:55

&gt;
&gt;  The astounding yet true rags-to-riches saga of a homeless father who raised and cared for his son on the mean streets of San Francisco and went on to become a crown prince of Wall Street
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;At the age of twenty, Milwaukee native Chris Gardner, just out of the Navy, arrived in San Francisco to pursue a promising career in medicine. Considered a prodigy in scientific research, he surprised everyone and himself by setting his sights on the competitive world of high finance. Yet no sooner had he landed an entry-level position at a prestigious firm than Gardner found himself caught in a web of incredibly challenging circumstances that left him as part of the city's working homeless and with a toddler son. Motivated by the promise he made to himself as a fatherless child to never abandon his own children, the two spent almost a year moving among shelters, ""HO-tels,"" soup lines, and even sleeping in the public restroom of a subway station.
&gt;
&gt;Never giving in to despair, Gardner made an astonishing transformation from being part of the city's invisible poor to being a powerful player in its financial district.
&gt;
&gt;More than a memoir of Gardner's financial success, this is the story of a man who breaks his own family's cycle of men abandoning their children. Mythic, triumphant, and unstintingly honest, The Pursuit of Happyness conjures heroes like Horatio Alger and Antwone Fisher, and appeals to the very essence of the American Dream.

[**Will**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58375739-will)

^(By: Will Smith, Mark Manson | 418 pages | Published: 2021 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, biography, memoir, nonfiction, audiobooks | )[^(Search ""will by WILL smith"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=will by WILL smith&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;One of the most dynamic and globally recognized entertainment forces of our time opens up fully about his life, in a brave and inspiring book that traces his learning curve to a place where outer success, inner happiness, and human connection are aligned. Along the way, Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had.
&gt;
&gt;Will Smith’s transformation from a fearful child in a tense West Philadelphia home to one of the biggest rap stars of his era and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, with a string of box office successes that will likely never be broken, is an epic tale of inner transformation and outer triumph, and Will tells it astonishingly well. But it's only half the story. 
&gt; 
&gt;Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over. 
&gt; 
&gt;This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one person mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home. The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life story that is preposterously entertaining, even astonishing, puts Will the book, like its author, in a category by itself.
&gt; 
&gt;“It’s easy to maneuver the material world once you have conquered your own mind. I believe that. Once you've learned the terrain of your own mind, every experience, every emotion, every circumstance, whether positive or negative, simply propels you forward, to greater growth and greater experience. That is true will. To move forward in spite of anything. And to move forward in a way that brings others with you, rather than leave them behind.” —Will Smith

DukenottheDuke,"Honestly a CFA wouldn't help you much when you are fresh off the university because this certificate requires finance working experience to obtain, not just passing 3 exams. If you ask me, I would say don't let CFA outweigh your opportunities to get work experience while still at the university. In finance industry your previous job experience always prevails.

However, CFA starts to matter once you have 3-4 years of work experience because that's when you're actually qualified as a CFA given you have passed the 3 exams. I haven't reached there but I know from where I come from, this is the fact. But don't let the fact that you won't be a CFA until 3-4 years later disappoint you, because in my country many companies specifically write in their recruitment descriptions that students who passed level 1 CFA exam are preferred (for internship opportunities).

Regarding business management or finance, trust me this is totally up to your personal preference. The reason I take it this way is because in finance, although some jobs look really really really fancy, you'd literally neck yourself if you're not up to the long hours and heavy stress. However, do notice that the finance industry is so broad and jobs included can be anywhere from big 4 to blackstone, you need to figure out which specific role you'd like to play. An auditor? An investment banker? Or a fund manager? These are all finance jobs but they require very different skills/qualifications. To be honest, from my personal understanding, a CPA could be more helpful than you'd think. I'm not saying CFA is bad and you should contribute your every effort to get a CFA, but don't underestimate the role of a CPA and it's not just for big 4 jobs. I was applying for jobs as an analyst in investment banks, and apparently they have an appetite to CPA holders/exam takers, which surprised me because I thought CFA is the only certificate they're after.

yaboynib,"To preface: the risk is that this is DeFi. Human error means that you can lose almost everything if you are not careful. I would highly recommend a hardware wallet and get yourself familiar with it. That will be your safest option in the long run.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, you have options! I would suggest splitting up your 'eggs' so they're not all in one basket. As others have suggested , you could put a portion of your networth into Terras Anchor protocol for \~20% on stable coins. 

You could also try out the [aTriCrypto3 pool on Curve Finance](https://polygon.curve.fi/atricrypto3) \[on the polygon network\], which is a liquidity pool consisting of 33% stable coins (10.9% DAI, 16.14% USDC, USDT 6.39%), BTC 33.31%, and ETH 33.26%. This could be a good option to mitigate risk of volatility, while still getting exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is currently netting 4.56 variable APR, and 18.44% rewards in curve. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another option is [OlympusDAO](https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/stake) \[Ethereum mainnet, but also you can get gOHM\]. They are aiming to become the decentralized reserve currency of DeFi (across all chains). In the long run purchasing OHM and staking it (This is called (3,3) and is based on Game Theory) is meant to make your income grow over time. If the price drops, the high APY and daily rebasing is meant to offset any sort of price loss. In theory, by participating in (3,3) , and being there for the long run - you are meant to only be in the Green. I highly suggest reading through their site (here you go! [https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/)) , and seeing what they have to offer. The passive compounding strategy might be what you're looking for. There's so much more to say, but I dont want to slam you with a huge wall of text. 

There's so much more in the world of DeFi. Good luck!",2021-12-09 22:13:09

Revanchist1,"A major part of Yield Farming is Governance tokens. For the most part, High Yield in DeFi is achieved through the farming of these governance tokens and the hope that they increase in value. The tokens are given out as incentives for using the platform and providing liquidity. 


The 'safest' farms are Curve Finance, Convex, or Yearn. They all rely on farming the CRV and CVX tokens. You can read about the [Curve Wars here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/r991sy/daily_general_discussion_-_december_5_2021/hnduxae?context=3) for a basic understanding of it. But to summarize owning more CRV and CVX = higher yield for users and more liquidity for stablecoins, so DAOs are trying to own as much as possible.


For an you, individual user, it's real simple. Visit convexfinance or yearn finance and look for a token or LP position you own that you want to earn yield on. And approve the token deposit and then deposit. It's two transactions and because of this you have to do the calculations to figure out if it's worth farming with the amount you want to farm with. More $$$ deposited = Faster you will break even. If you have to spend $300 on tx fees to deposit $1,000 earn an estimated 10% a year ($100) it's not worth it.  


Now we return to the first part of my post. You won't be rewarded in your native currency. The yield is paid out in the platforms governance tokens. And these token prices can go up or down. So the yield is variable and not set in stone.",2021-12-12 07:07:43

Hikingwhiledrinking,"&gt;Blockchain s get hacked, and if they don't, smart contracts do, and if they don't, individual wallets do.  Cold storage is very secure, but currency is meant to move, not stay stagnant.

Billions in fiat is hacked, stolen, extorted every year as well. 

I agree that security has certainly been an issue in crypto from the beginning, but these financial woes can largely be ascribed to the novelty of the technology and a steeper learning curve than traditional financial services. 

1. Blockchains are becoming increasingly resilient to attack. Yes 51% attacks do still happen on occasion, but mostly small Proof-of-Work chains with low hashrates. Verge's attack earlier this year resulted in no funds lost. This is not a problem for most established chains these days.
2. Smart contract audits are way more commonplace, and coding best practices more well-established. This problem may not be fully soluble due to the immutability feature of blockchains, but things are improving substantially.
3. Most wallet breaches are due to phishing scams and owner carelessness. This is the steeper learning curve. Most of us have not been conditioned to have full custodial control over our funds, and most don't fully understand that there's often no centralized authority to whom you can complain to recoup losses.

unfair_bastard,"To describe such a sea change in views on LGBT issues in the anglophone countries, and throughout parts of Europe as a ""mindset"" is far too simple and seems both protean and monolithic. It is a nuanced issue, the details of which are still being worked out and integrated into that legal tradition I mentioned above. These questions turn primarily, in the US at least, on questions having to do with interpretations of several constitutional amendments as well as the Civil Rights laws of the 1960s, while going into the details in the UK, Canada, etc is beyond the scope of this post, yet relate to similar issues of individual rights, dignity, etc. Generally changes in these views across sections of society in the anglophone countries happen piecemeal and are not viewed as a national mindset, but rather as a mix of individual viewpoints which often prioritize different things. It is more of a patchwork, or a mosaic of often dissonant viewpoints, so viewing it as one mindset would result in a rather schizophrenic mindset if one wants to use that framing. 

It makes even less sense to think of crime this way, especially in a diverse society. There is no ""mindset on crime"", there are many interacting mindsets on crime which produce various emergent effects. A better way to get a sense of something akin to ""mindset"" might be via opinion polling

The US is not #1 in rape, various African countries take the top slots with South Africa usually #1, where in the world are you getting this? Same with murder. You do mean per capita, right? Again, estimates certainly exist, and that is good. Why do you keep dodging the point that China doesn't even give official #s and considers the matter a state secret? When ""quarreling and provoking trouble"" is a crime punishable by years in prison, not knowing how many are in prison for that is troubling. Yes, we can estimate. That is decidedly not the point

""The US government only bails out banks"". Wow. Please do some more history reading. The US government basically bails out every sector of the economy besides consumers fairly regularly. Look up ""airline bailouts"" as just one example. The federal government will write off student debt to save the universities, whom the debt financed educations primarily benefit, as almost all of the debt is owed by students (in the end) to the US dept of education. Barely any private loans are a part of the system. The US govt can trivially forgive the debt, as they are the party owed the money. It is more a political issue, as many (but not all) in the US who paid their tuition would demand some sort of similar payment of equal value as someone having their loans forgiven. Look at the response Elizabeth Warren often gets from parents who paid for their children's university. I find their animosity towards debt forgiveness puzzling, but it is laid out quite clearly. Writing it off would be relatively trivial economically compared to the political difficulty

As for how the economy is not failing, where to begin? Do you have an econ or finance background? You seem to know at least enough to look up frightening looking charts, but I can't tell if this is because you understand the genuine risk that exists there, or because you're simply repeating what someone has shown you or taught to you. I don't mean this to be rude, but merely as to what level to tailor my response. Do let me know what might be best. I'm not going to go through each of your questions in depth because it would take too long, but in short:

M2 has grown terrifically in the last 2 years, mainly in response to the ""liferafting"" of the real economy into the financial system during covid. This is temporary and it is ending. A lot of credit was created, and a lot will have to be destroyed

Inflation is at a multi decade high because of what is in my opinion a major policy error by the Fed, which ended up in quite a difficult situation between fiscal policy errors and foreign policy errors. However, it's nowhere near the worst of the 70s, and not an intractable problem. Wait for the rate hikes. My guess is that you think they'll result in collapse. I do not

So before I go into answering any of your questions on RRP I need to ask if you understand IOER, FFR, their history, changes since the 1980s and 1990s, etc. You're asking a question that requires knowledge of the history of the banking system, and I need to know where to begin in answering your question, as well as how much you understand of how the banking system works (e.g. discount window, time deposits, net margin). You're basically asking, whether you know it or not, how we get out of the negative interest rate trap (that is to say, the Fed, ECB, and BoJ primarily, as the three largest and most leveraged central banks). I think the likeliest way to do this is to goose ECB out of negative rates with a joint and several issuance red bond/blue bond setup as proposed in 2012, combined with swaps of current negative yielding German bonds held by e.g. German insurance companies, for newly issued positive yielding German red bonds along with ECB rate hikes. This would unhook the 30yrBund/Bond arb holding down the long end of the UST curve, allowing for curve re-inversion and for pressure to come off the short end (this is part of what's driving new M2 issuance)

^this is the short answer. The long answer depends on if you understand what Volcker shock did, as well as what Greenspan began in the 1990s",2021-12-13 06:23:29
isheep225,"If I have only one advice to give, it would be to educate yourself before doing anything with this crazy amount of MATIC. But I'll answer your question anyway. 

You got to understand that when people say they are staking MATIC, everybody is not always refering to the same thing. When people say ""stake"", they all think of ""depositing MATIC in order to get a reward"", which can be done by many ways. 

(I will put the links here for people to click if they are interested and if they want to confirm, but, as other have said, I SUGGEST YOU TO NOT CLICK ON ANY LINK ON HERE, EVEN MINE, AS YOU OWN A F\*&amp;?&amp;\* LOT OF MATIC, STAY  SAFE) (I suggest you to make Google Search of everything and click only on the first results you get to reach the above links)

&amp;#x200B;

1. Delegation to a validator

**What it is:** This one is the only ""staking"" you can get with your MATICs. Every other way is a way to get rewards, but not properly staking.

Official staking on Polygon is when you delegate your MATIC to a validator. Validators are people who, well, validate transactions on Polygon. These people accumulate a lot of MATIC from everybody through a smart contract, and then the Polygon protocol gives them randomly the right to validate transaction blocks in exchange of a reward. The randomness of this process is proportional to how many MATIC a validator has staked. To get more chances to be the chosen one and to receive rewards, validator welcome anybody who wants to stake his MATIC to his own pool. Generally, they will take a small fee in exchange of the right they give you to stake with them. As you know, Polygon is an L2 chain. 

**How to**: The validation and staking processes are happening on the Ethereum chain, through a smart contract on Ethereum. What you have to do is put your MATIC onto an Ethereum wallet ([Metamask](https://metamask.io/faqs)'s FAQ is very good to guide you, try it with small amount first to make sure you understand the process. [Coinbase Wallet](https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/sending-and-receiving/how-do-i-move-assets-between-my-coinbase-wallet-and-my-coinbase) may be another option if you want to keep it easy). Make sure to withdraw on the Ethereum chain if asked (Not Polygon chain actually OTHERWISE YOU MAY LOOSE YOUR MATICs). You will also need some ETH (100$ worth maybe), as you will need to pay for the gas fees on Ethereum to make the whole process. You then have to make your wallet interact with a [validation smart contract](https://wallet.polygon.technology/staking) on the official Polygon delegation tool. Then, your token will be transfered and you will get rewards every few minutes. APR is a little over 11% for now, it varies according to the number of MATIC staked, which is 14k MATIC per year.

**PROS:** 

* It is a good APY
* It is pretty transparent
* You really participate to the project itself

**CONS:**

* It happens on the Ethereum blockchain. You got to understand that 11% is the reward you'll get for a year. But you can actually gain a little more if you COMPOUND the reward to get. Compounding means you put the MATIC you get as a reward back into your staking with the smart contract. Which makes your bag bigger and gain more. But as you are on the Ethereum blockchain, and that gas fees are crazy high to access the chain, you will have to pay EVERYTIME you compound, which makes you loose a lot of the interest of compound frequently. It could eat a good chunk of this 14k MATIC reward
* Steep learning curve. Must know what you do at every step so your money remain safe

2. CeFi lending

**What it is**: Many businesses are now proposing to kend them your MATIC in order to receive a reward. It is very much like lending to your bank to get interests on your money. What they do with it varies a lot (they can lend it back to someone else, stake, short MATIC, make DeFi, etc.) and you don't really care in the end. You just lend to a company and they have a contract with you to give you some MATIC at various rates. [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) offers 12%, [Celcius](https://celsius.network/earn-rewards-on-your-crypto) offer 8,99%, [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/1e95e0d5bcf149458ede730dbba7eb75) offers great rate, but with a bonding period (you can't withdraw nomatter what for a fixed period of time), [Nexo](https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-arrives-on-nexo-with-up-to-20-apr-for-matic-holders/) offers 20% and there are probably others I'm not awared of. CeFi means Centralized Finance, as yuo make finance through an actual business.

**How to**: You have first to open an account onto the platform you want to use. Next, you will have to transfer you MATIC tokens to this exchange. When transfering , make sure you use the same chain (either transfering MATIC token from Ethereum chain to Ethereum chain OR from Polygon chain to Polygon chain), OTHERWISE YOU MAY LOOSE YOUR MATICs. From there, the process is straight forward within the app of the platform.

**PROS:** 

* Easier to use
* Easier to understand
* Compounding is usually within the app, no gas fees
* You have some sort of safety because you have client support and legal recourses for many things that could happen

**CONS:** 

* You are supporting centralized exchange, which for many is against the philosophy of crypto
* You don't know what the company is doing with your money (it may be fraud, they may loose it all)
* Your money depends on the their will. If they refuse to let you have your money or if they close without giving your fund back, well, it sucks a lot (pretty much like a normal bank could fail)

isheep225,"3. DeFi lending  
What it is: the whole original idea of crypto is to get rid of bank. DeFi means Decentralized Finance, which is the process of making all sort of financial operation without intermediaries, using on chain technology. The main thing you financial operation you can do to gain some rewards is to lend your tokens on chain. This way, random people will borrow your MATICs in exchange of fees. Aave is the most popular lending platform on Polygon. There you can interact with a smart contract and to lend your coins and earn rewards. Actually, you can even use Aave to lend your MATICs, then borrow more MATICs using your lent MATICs as a collateral in case you can refund what you borrowed, then stake back the lent one to get more rewards. Usually, this process is not profitable, but because Polygon collaborated with Aave to give some more MATICs so it can become more attractive for the users to borrow, you are actually paid to borrow. Without doing the lend/borrow loop, you can earn 4%, which varies from day to day according to demand. With the loop, you can get probably close to 10%There are probably other platforms where you can lend on chain on Polygon, but I am not up to date on this matter. (If you lend on Aave, make sure you keep some MATIC aside to pay for gas fees on the Polygon chain. For instance, Stake 129 999k and keep 1 MATIC to pay when you'll withdraw your tokens)  
How to: First, you will need to get your MATICs on the Polygon chain. First step will be to get a wallet as in step one. From what I know, Coinbase doesn't allow you to withdraw your MATIC on the Polygon chain (only Ethereum chain), and so will need to transfer it either by transfering your tokens to another exchange that support MATICs to Polygon withdrawals (Binance and Crypto.com do). Which would be the cheapest way. Or you withdraw your tokens to Ethereum chain using an Ethereum wallet, then use the official Polygon bridge to transfer from Ethereum to Polygon. Which is way more expensive. Then, you continue on Aave and follow instructinos.   
PROS:  
You have full control on your coins  
Very transparent  
Very liquid. If an Aave alternative appears, you can switch in a matter of minutes with almost no fees  
Very fun to enter the Defi world  
CONS:   
The learning curve of this as steep as the first option  
Rewards are less predictable  
There are other ways of earning rewards. I am thinking of pooling your tokens, leveraging on exchanges, putting into vaults on DeFi services, lending your MATIC on something like QiDAO to use stablecoins to farm, etc. The one I provided are the simplest option and great opportunities to learn. But, please, educate yourself before doing any move; read, watch videos, try with small amounts.",2021-12-13 07:36:45
Haydn31,"Renting an instrument is always a loser. You pay list price plus a whopping finance charge. The entire business is predicated on the idea that the kid’s going to quit so the parents will be able to return it. (How the parents are then motivated to encourage the student during the initial slow learning curve is a mystery.) It’s much better to buy the instrument, pay for it on a credit card which will have a lower interest rate and allow you to pay it off more quickly and pay even less interest. If the student does drop it you can easily sell it on eBay or Craiglist. Used instruments typically sell for about one half to two thirds of the new price.

Same thing with step up or pro horns. Buy from a reputable dealer and finance with a credit card. FYI Trumpets are almost always discounted.

Last point. Most higher level players want to try the specific instrument they’re buying so it’s normal to be offered the display horn, which obviously should be clean and in new condition when you get it. That said, it’s perfectly normal to ask for and get a untouched horn in the box (though the store should check and lube it for you).",2021-12-13 08:35:10

MrMoustacheMan,"#DEX - Con Argument

Reusing my previous entry [from here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pfos3j/rcc_cointest_general_concepts_dex_conarguments/hdw1d32/). 

*Disclosure - I currently hold several DEX governance tokens, ~5% of my current portfolio value*

##What are decentralized exchanges and automated market makers?

* (1) Intro: https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-decentralized-exchange-dex

* (2) Vitalik's original Reddit post: https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/55m04x/lets_run_onchain_decentralized_exchanges_the_way/

##DEX caveats

 I'm extremely bullish on [DeFi](https://decrypt.co/resources/defi-ultimate-beginners-guide-decentralized-finance) and believe DEXs specifically hold great promise in terms of: reducing counterparty risk, preserving anonymity and removing barriers to entry for users looking to trade and earn yield. 

That being said, there are some tradeoffs and limitations of interacting with DEXs to be aware of: 

##Yo dawg, I heard you like decentralization    

- Decentralization can refer [to the protocol itself or to the governance and development of the protocol/platform](https://miro.medium.com/max/1304/0*epCTOVyxEmQq-AiU).

- [Decentralization is a spectrum](https://nopara73.medium.com/few-words-on-decentralization-and-anonymous-payments-160782d30b9e) rather than a binary distinction. So a DEX may be [decentralized in some ways but centralized in others](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/07/23/decentralized-exchanges-arent-living-up-to-their-name-and-data-proves-it/). Governance and developer control of a platform, for example, can vary wildly:

    &gt;“Some have large control over their direction, others are governed by venture capital investors, and others have broader communities that vote in changes like an open source project.”
\- [Lex Sokolin, CMO and Global Fintech Co-Head, ConsenSys](https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/why-defi-isn-t-always-as-decentralized-as-you-might-think-7695.htm)

    - Users in the [Uniswap Con Cointest thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og2r4t/rcryptocurrency_cointest_top_10_category_uniswap/) have articulated many of their concerns about whales and VC interests dominating UNI governance politics.

    - But I'll repeat the example of [Uniswap's unilateral decision to delist tokens](https://decrypt.co/76793/ethrereum-dex-uniswap-drops-tokenized-stocks-as-regulators-close-in) after facing regulatory scrutiny from the SEC. Even if a certain protocol is decentralized, the team can take actions to limit access.

    - Similarly, the DeFi community was not too pleased when Compound CEO Robert Leshner [threatened to doxx users](https://decrypt.co/82387/defi-community-blasts-compound-ceo-for-doxxed-comment) who didn't return COMP tokens after a protocol bug.

        - ""Code is law. Unless we fuck up. Then we call the IRS on you."" said [Blockstream CSO Samson Mow](https://nitter.com/Excellion/status/1443875126982840330). 

- Another concern would be seemingly decentralized platforms like Bancor having backdoors and the ability to freeze user funds ([which they did after a hack](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/10/bancor-loses-23-5m/)).

    - [As LTC founder Charlie Lee stated](https://nitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1016499756158234624):

     &gt;""An exchange is not decentralized if it can lose customer funds OR if it can freeze customer funds. Bancor can do BOTH. It's a false sense of decentralization.""

    - [Or, as DOGE founder Jackson Palmer commented](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/the-lessons-learned-from-a-false-sense-of-decentralization-875b8c2731a6):

     &gt;“The key thing here is not the hack itself — it’s the fact the Bancor team had the ability to freeze funds. How many other “decentralized” DApps have a built-in kill switch that’s centrally controlled?”

- In removing gatekeepers and intermediaries, DEXs and AMMs promise a more level financial playing field than the permissioned, opaque system of centralized finance. 

    - However, even when governance of an open source platform is 'fair' and decentralized, DEX users are exposed to some of the same financial fuckery inherent to CeFi, [such as front running](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest/).

    - There is no need for practices like [Robinhood's payment for order flow](https://web.archive.org/web/20210729220645/https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhoods-debut-is-clouded-by-sec-scrutiny-of-payment-for-order-flow-11625655600) when trades are publicly broadcasted for the world to see:

        - ""[Decentralized exchanges make it easier for anyone to exploit temporary market inefficiencies for a profit. In other words, it’s easier to front-run the market](https://blog.gnosis.pm/decentralized-exchanges-have-a-problem-7e6d81d91ba1).""


        - ""[Trades on decentralized exchanges \(DEX\) are sitting ducks while they remain idle in the processing queue. A small cohort of developers can and do take advantage of this lag time between hitting the trade button and the trade executing on-chain by front-running, back-running or 'sandwiching' a transaction.](https://www.yahoo.com/now/bad-sandwich-defi-trader-poisons-153336603.html)""


##With mediocre UX comes great responsibility

- DEXs are often not newbie friendly 

    - There is a learning curve to self-custodying and creating a web wallet

    - Because of the immutability of blockchain transactions, it can be [easy for even savvy traders to learn an expensive lesson about human error](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/jo7lj2/help_needed_i_payed_235172_eth_9500_for_120/)

    - The process can be further intimidating when attempting to[ bridge assets on sidechains and L2s](https://ethhole.link/layer2) (and it is precisely smaller, newer traders who benefit most from[ lower fees](https://l2fees.info/))

- So it's not surprising that [many users - especially new market participants - would prefer to accept the counterparty risk of a custodial exchange](https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-regains-1-position-on-apple-app-store-as-crypto-com-jumps-to-third) in return for a consumer oriented and streamlined user experience:

    - Given lack of KYC/AML, the majority of DEXs do not allow for onboarding/offboarding fiat and require users to touch a centralized exchange at some point if they want to get money in or out of 'the system'.

        - To go back to the Compound bug, Leshner clarified that his 'doxx' comment was in reference to DeFi users' interactions with centralized exchanges:

         &gt; ""[He said that anyone could identify the public Ethereum addresses that interact with the Compound protocol, and whether they engaged with popular exchanges like Coinbase that collect information about users.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/business/dealbook/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen.html)""

    - Few DEXs natively offer the same level of trading functionality as centralized exchanges (e.g. limit orders, stop losses).

    - While centralized exchange users are primarily concerned with fees and spread, DEX users must also familiarize themselves with concepts like [slippage](https://academy.shrimpy.io/post/what-is-slippage-how-to-avoid-slippage-on-defi-exchanges) and [impermanent loss](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained)

- As the market becomes more saturated with DEX platforms and aggregators, it can be difficult for a lay user to evaluate competing promises of trustlessness and decentralization - or recognize when they're being exploited.

    - [Exit scams and rugpulls are prolific](https://decrypt.co/55787/defi-rug-pulls-were-cryptos-top-fraud-scheme-in-2020-ciphertrace) - newbies may find it challenging to verify if a DEX is legitimate, especially when dev teams are anonymous and many users lack technical proficiency to audit the protocol/smart contracts themselves.

- While hacks and phishing risks aren't limited to DEXs, they expose [users to additional attack vectors](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-identify-and-avoid-uniswap-scams):


    - Given [the ease of creating \(copy/pasting\) and listing a token](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/business/hype-coins-cryptocurrency.html), it's no surprise that scamcoins abound on DEXs, many of which [spoof legitimacy](https://twitter.com/uniwhalesio/status/1357785710896545792).

        - E.g., [researchers identified over 10K scam tokens and scam liquidity pools on Uniswap V2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00229).

        - Or check out [this recent attack which shows how Uniswap v3 liquidity pools can be manipulated](https://twitter.com/Mudit__Gupta/status/1455627465678749696).

    - More sinister is when [developers tweak the token contract to take your assets](https://twitter.com/r0bster97/status/1338182571558055937) or [remove a token's approval function](https://cryptot3ddybear.github.io/posts/scam-explained-bsc-noapproval/), preventing you from dumping the scamcoin you just bought.

    - Lastly, a DEX often requires users to approve or allow access to a given token before trading. [The default 'unlimited allowance' is convenient, but if exploited it allows bad actors to sweep your funds](https://learn.zapper.fi/articles/how-to-revoke-token-allowances).",2021-12-14 04:49:28

Kaiju_Rad,"First of all, don't be stubborn ass(pardon my French) about what job you want to do. Take whatever opportunity comes. Keep your learning curve good. Be open for feedback and suggestions. Don't give in or give up, remember what you are working for. 

Make friends with every kind of people. You may never know, when you might need them.

Help others as much as possible, it does not matter if they help you back or not. Either way, you will get learning or some good friends.

Get as much as experience possible, go for interviews where you have no chance. You will get free knowledge and best part, if you go for MNC that are super rich, like Google or Vmware or JPMC or any such top 5, you will get free food and beverage.

Never be ashamed of people mocking you or even humiliating you. Trust me, you will have the last laugh. I come from a family that will put you down or make you feel that you are not good enough. Heard from my own parents that, you better give up as you are not good enough.

 Try to sell yourself even if no one is asking for it. Trust me, they will remember you first, when they need something. But not like insta influencers. When I say sell yourself, I mean, make others understand how much value you can add or what new you can bring to the table. Trust me, you can use this to meet someone interesting.

Never worry about finance or getting stuck. Always remember if you want it that badly, you will figure a way out.

Finally, remember that your current situation is not permanent, it will pass. Even if you don't do anything also, things will change. Giving up will only make you feel bad. Never miss an opportunity. Even if it means losing money or having to put a pause to a relationship or getting to hear the worst from people around you. 

All of the above mentioned things are not something that I am preaching. I was in those situations and I gained from them. 

Also I choose this for me. I was that child who had no idea about what he wants to do or can get easily brainwashed by a movie and daydream about situation that will never happen in my life.

Now, i'm not defending the blind hate, it makes me very sad that people are having such a negative sentiment over something that is beneficial towards them. The potential exists, I am very confident that this will not just be a bubble and will seriously change how finance works when all the problems start getting solved and the technology is innovated.

If I do stablecoin farming, I can get around 15-30% APY, e.g. in [this](https://app.beefy.finance/#/polygon/vault/curve-poly-eurt) EURt/DAI/USDC/USDT on Polygon/Beefy finance. Risks: Tether-collapse, Polygon-collapse, smart contract risks on curve and beefy.

If I want to LP, how would I even go about it? [This](https://app.beefy.finance/#/polygon/vault/quick-dai-eth) beefy DAI-ETH vault is based on QuickSwap and claims 25% APY.

To me, the main point seems to be that with LPs, I keep price exposure to ETH, which can be both negative or positive. Using an [IL calculator](https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/), an in initial $1000 LP position would be worth $1400 if ETH price doubles, and ~$700 if ETH price halves.

* Finance attorneys will likely work less in the aggregate but the spikes are far worse.  If you're an M&amp;A attorney, you're likely to have greater visibility into the process for an acquisition.  Finance won't be brought under the tent until things are actually shaping up to move forward in a meaningful way.  Even if you're a partner, your acquisition partner will let you know things are rumbling but the client won't want to rope you in until it's looking like the acquisition is moving forward.  
* Further to the above bullet, lender side is typically worse for the spikes - borrower's counsel will find out Monday or Tuesday that they need to have a document out to lenders, so they'll prepare in 48 hours, distribute to their client, spend another couple hours revising after a call with their client, and then fire it off early Friday or Saturday, while lender's counsel gets to spend their weekend working on the papers for a 48-60 hour turnaround.
* The difficulty curves are different - finance is closer to tax in intellectual demand than M&amp;A, M&amp;A has a fairly normal curve towards building a skillset, while a strong finance associate will be expected to pick up difficult and foreign concepts (often revolving around actual finance/accounting) in the background and then be proficient in them around year 5.  It's abundantly clear when a finance lawyer is ""not good"" while a below-grade M&amp;A lawyer has an easier time of hiding.",2021-12-18 05:03:24
ChaoticKinesis,"Smart contract gas fees on ETH can easily go into the hundreds of dollars, which should effectively price out most people not transacting in 5 figures or more. In comparison, a rough estimate of gas fees on the chains I'd recommend for beginners would be $0.01-0.10 on Polygon, $0.25-1.00 on Avalanche, and $0.10-0.50 on Terra.

Not financial advice but Avalanche and Terra are getting a lot of attention with new projects and seem particularly set to explode if the bull market should resume. Polygon is a more established chain with a lot of great protocols.

Check out Defi Llama to get a very thorough overview of what's available on these chains. As for protocols, you can take a look at AAVE, Curve, and Beefy Finance for Avalanche/Polygon and Anchor, Terraswap, and Mirror on Terra.",2021-12-18 05:31:09
ToeTiddler,"I've shown you the math like 5 fucking times already, but your IQ skews so far to the left of the IQ distribution curve that you can't even follow basic arithmetic.

Here it is again (use the one where he doesn't have a depreciating asset I.e. car because he shouldn't fucking have one at that income level anyways, again, it's called sacrificing):


$26,141 take home pay

$2,180 monthly take home (rounded)

**Less:**

$725 for rent 

$133 for utilities 

$278.50 for groceries (median single person grocery bill in MD is $3,342 annually) 

$60 broadband internet

$60 cell phone 

$72 monthly transit pass (let's use a car instead so we won't deduct this amount, though it would be far more financially savvy for Johnny to not use a car if he can do so)

$151 auto loan payment ($2,000 car, $500 down, 36 mo. term at 4.99%). We'll also assume this is a constant payment I.e. it goes out beyond the 36 mo. term after he paid it off to account for maintenance and purchasing a new car years later.

$120 car insurance (probably a reasonable amount considering his car is only worth $2,000 but I didn't look into this very much)

$300 for spending cash

= monthly savings of $352.50

Annual savings of $4,230.

Let's assume Johnny's initial investment is $3,500, and he invests 80% of his monthly savings every month (I.e. $282).

At 8% interest the balance of his investment after 10 years = $58,351.28 + savings of $8,460 = $66,811.28.

At 10% interest the balance of his investment after 10 years = $65,439.71 + savings of $8,460 = $73,899.71.

He's pretty close but will take him a few more years to get to $100k.

Alternatively, if he took public transit all those years and used those car payments and insurance premiums to invest instead he would end up with $107,164.96 at the end of 10 years (at 8% annual interest), so he could make his goal if he cuts the car ownership out entirely.

The other consideration is that John/Jack/whoever the hell probably doesn't need $100k liquid cash to open a coffee shop. I bet he could get a loan for $50k and finance the other $50k himself rather than put all $100k in at once. Hell, he could probably get away with investing only $20k of his own capital. If he is smart he will borrow some, though, if he was smart he wouldn't be opening a coffee shop at all lol.

If you ask me, Johnny should focus on getting a higher paying job instead first, then he can live a little better and make even bigger investing gains down the line.

Side note, I have a very good friend (blue collar guy) makes $60k (Canadian dollars, so $46.5k USD) a year now (started at $45k I think - about $35k USD) and through prudent RE investments and sacrificing his standard of living by driving beater cars and living very cheaply (think he was investing close to 80% of his income) has amassed a RE portfolio worth a few million dollars (Canadian dollars) in about 7 years. Never had a six figure salary but has a fantastic net worth now because he made sacrifices and started investing early. Definitely helped that RE has appreciated in a major way in parts of Canada. 

Guy is going to retire before the age of 40 off a very average salary. It's possible.",2021-12-18 05:42:58

I think central exchanges are for those who are comfortable with it. In my opinion, for lots of people are safer than DeFi. Don’t get me wrong, i am %80 in DeFi. But i think, CEXs are fundamental for crypto adaption.

CEX are far more suitable for day trading and buying coins. At the end they are just services. Whenever I try to buy crypto through DeFi, there are huge fees. (For Atom withdrawals i use a CEX without any problem this week, but Binance usually suspends some blockchains (like polygon, matic). TBH, i never had problems withdrawing xlm or trc20 (hah never used erc20 that some exchanges still insisting to use it for exclusively). Banks seem to be a bigger problems in this equation. But in my opinion, we are way too early to take out intermediaries for crypto. 

I don’t even recommend anyone to use Metamask, if they are just entering crypto currency space. Few days ago, i saw a fake curve finance site, so fucking well made to take your seed phrase.

I'm not so certain that the vaccine is responsible for reduced hospitalizations or if the virus had become unstable as it spread.  And possibly weaker mutations evolving as it attempts to survive.  The efficacy of the virus has to be propped up as the world is dedollarizing.  Countries are having to take USD loans, putting up sovereign assets as collateral, to get these vaccines.  It's a playbook from the ""Confessions of an Economic Hitman"".  I get the sense there's a 1970s style dedollarization with Opec, particularly Saudi Arabia, attempting to turn away from the USD after the 2008 GFC created by our banksters.  There's a famous photo of MBS and Putin hugging it out which is strange.  We were the largest producer and exporter of oil since 2016 while being the world reserve currency.  OPEC doesn't take too kindly to the fact we finance oil exploration/development/production with money we create out of thin air.  Anyways, some will know we had an inverted yield curve in 2019 and in November the repo market blew up with rates going up to 10% overnight.  OPEC threatened to increase oil production as we headed into a downturn (presumably to crash oil prices).  It appears the lockdowns did OPEC worse when oil crashed to negative $40/barrel.

schmelf,Is this specifically about pensions? Because anything that’s mandated to hold lower risk assets right now is gonna be in pretty rough shape. I’m not necessarily advocating for increased risk but in order to break even against inflation right now the general public is being pushed out the risk curve. Bonds are at negative real yields right now so they are in fact return free risk. I personally think the risk climate in debt assets is worse than normal right now and yields are lower than ever (relatively speaking on a long term basis). I don’t think bonds are as low risk right now as conventional finance would lead you to believe. Debt to income levels are getting out of control and at some point people are going to have to start paying down their debt.

When Standard was the main driver of sales, between being fast between event coverage and eBay and predicting shifts in the meta, you'd have long quiet periods punctuated by intense price motion ripe for smart speculation.  When Archangel Avacyn was clearly positioned to dominate standard, for example, I went in DEEP on 3 dollar Ishkanahs just because it had 5 toughness and reach, which I unloaded a month later for 20 each.  

Now, it's pretty standard; buy limited run products and hold for 5 years to see what the price action is like.  EDH driving the market just isn't enjoyable from a speculation perspective.

LogrisTheBard,"A few brief predictions for 2022.

1) Incremental improvements to capital efficiency, especially in AMMs. Exchanges like Balancer are deploying their inactive liquidity to yield farms. Bancor v3 is targeting the same niche. Curve is branching out beyond like-kind assets and will compete with Sushi for the incentivized liquidity game.

2) Better Liquidity automation and management tools on top of Uniswap v3. XToken is going more heavily in that direction. We have Visor, Tokemak is coming online, Impermax is slowly gaining TVL.

3) We'll see the rise of more liquidity direction right (LDR) tokens in the style of Curve, Pickle, etc. Scheduled regular votes that direct emissions. YFI seems to already be going there. I see no reason Impermax, XToken, Alchemix, etc won't follow. If you have emissions, granting governance control over those emissions adds value to the governance token. This will lead to escalated CRV wars. More bribe platforms like Convex, Votemak, and Badger. Someone might even generalize the concept (feel free to steal Concave finance).

4) More tools for DAOs like Coordinape, Snapshot, and KPIs. Bonds will continue to gain traction. Liquidity Direction protocols like Tokemak will come online and slowly replace direct emissions to Pool-2's. Defi is going to revolutionize liquidity farming as you know it.

5) More protocols will use staking funds as an insurance backstop for protocol failure. Some day we're going to see a more successful insurance model than Nexus Mutual, Umbrella, weird prediction markets, etc. In the short term though staking pools are the likely answer.

6) We'll start to see more protocols directly incentivize voter participation. Eventually we'll see the rise of some type of standardized vote delegation system but it may not be this year. Also we'll eventually see some bonded voting mechanisms appear such as UMA KPIs but probably not in mass this year.

7) Mass migrations of liquidity to Ethereum L2's. L2 Summer was a dud but this is style coming in a big way.

8) Stable coin growth to $1T. Might not all be on Ethereum and the distribution will hopefully continue to shift away from Tether but we did more than 10x last year and its only like 6-7x to $1T. That will put stablecoins at about 1% of all fiat supply. The US can't ignore this.

9) More 'badge' style NFTs such as POAPs that can only be unlocked based your history. These will become increasingly gamified and woven into more complex systems.

10) Institutional staking. We saw Ether capital start staking. Maybe we'll see ETHE start staking. Eventually someone big is going to stake through Rocketpool and keep the extra Node fees as their profit. The fuse is already lit on this.",2021-12-21 08:04:19

KGrahnn,"This is only true if you are a potato. For example I have no trouble gaining credits up to tier 10 while playing with no boosters and no premium time. If you are a good enough player, you can choose what to play, you dont need premium accout necessarily. You need it only if you are a potato.

 Normal curve is somewhat like that a potato can still play upto tier 8 and not go bankrupt, but higher tiers will most often drain the credits. Thus it forces most players to play lower tiers. It has an effect which spreads players wider across the tiers. This way everyone are not playing only the tier 10. It also has an effect that some players pay real money for premium time, which allows then to play more higher tiers, than without premium time. And real money allows WG to finance this game for people who are playing it for free.

The balance is quite intricate. Its quite possible to play all tiers, but its intentionally designed as such, that its more easier and enjoyable, as well less stressful to play, if you have premium time. I have premium time for example just because it makes my life easier. Most often I got no time to play try hard, and I want to casually enjoy some of my non meta tanks. Those tanks have certain weaknesses which can be overcome or make less weak by for example shooting premium ammo and using premium consumables. 

This doesnt mean I would have full load of gold, but if I empty one clip of amx 13 57 gold rounds into is3 side in one gmame, it wont bankrupt me. With premium account I can do this more often, and I dont have to even think about it. And it allows me to not think about it, I can just casually throw it, if I see an opportunity in a game. Without premium time I would probably think the cost of using the premium rounds, and the opportunity would go past and most often cost the game as well. One decisive flanking fight might affect the match so, that you win it in that moment for your team. You kill that tank which was crucial for enemy flank, and the potato teammates of yours finally have courage to advance, when that evil is3 is dead.

Thus few premium rounds  can make a difference and win more games for you.

But wot being unplayable? This is not true. Even if you are a potato, it only forces you to play lower tiers more often, to finance few higher tier games, until you again need to grind credits again at lower tiers. And if you climb up from the pile of shit and shine like a star, instead being just turd, you can choose to play what ever tier you want to.",2021-12-22 11:06:16
Adam_The_Millennial,"A majority of welfare programs don’t allow people to get on unless they work. Minus programs for people with kids because it isn’t about taking care of the parents in that case. The only reason why a lot of those single mothers don’t work is because we have very garbage child care programs. 

Politicians set it up to where most of these single mothers have to choose between not working and focusing on their kids or to work a job and not have money or time for their kids. 

A majority of the people on welfare are not fraudsters. Data shows maybe 1/10 applications are fraudulent. 
- www.lexingtonlaw.com/blog/finance/welfare-statistics.html/amp

If you are against those who defraud the system, I implore you to campaign against them rather than our welfare as a whole. We are the richest country in the world we should have no one starving. 

Even if we had every single person housed and fed on tax dollars, it’s not like these people are guaranteed to have enough money for everything they want. Honestly? That system would show even more who is willing to work because then people will be free to work for the things they want. They will be able to work for the economic positions they want. 

Everyone is too busy drowning and trying to survive instead of focusing on improving themselves or society. This won’t be something that can be fixed in one presidential term. This is going to take a generation or several to improve even if we start it right now full throttle. 

You’re right that not every single person in poverty will be able to be the next einstein. But some of them will. I was born into poverty. My family never had welfare growing up. I joined the military because being a physicist and mathematician isn’t economically viable.  

I served honorably and meritoriously for my entire adult life up until I was injured in service and was medically separated right before the pandemic. 

Now I have been studying computer science, AI, and how to improve our educational systems with game engines and VR. I don’t have to stress to survive because my disability payments are enough to have my basic necessities. 

Now I am free to put my brain to advancing our country. I always scored in the top percentile of the ASVAB and any other training program I went into during service. I got multiple meritorious promotions and trained hundreds of marines. But all that was stuff I was not passionate about. I still did it because I was capable and liked teaching others. 

But now? Thanks to VA disability, I am doing stuff I am passionate about. I can’t run or bend down anymore, but I can work at a computer. I know I am not the typical case, but these social safety nets turned a disabled body who can’t work anymore into someone who can help thousands in the future. If one in ten are fraudsters, maybe one in ten are like me as well. And I am sure I will be able to add more value to the US with my efforts than the few thousand dollars that fraudster drains. 

Yes. There are lazy people who have no aspirations, but a majority of people aren’t like that. 

Yes. There are a lot of unintelligent people in poverty, but literally half of them are above average. There are just as many intelligent people per capita in every single population. The bell curve will show up in every population for every metric. 

If we throw out the programs that help the disadvantaged just because 1/10th of the people are fraudulent, that means that all the people who legitimately benefit get left in the dust too. 

We should be empowering the population and then going after the fraudsters instead of generalizing the fraudsters to the majority because it is objectively not true that a majority of them are fraudulent or unintelligent. 



—- one more caveat. I used intelligence, not education in this entire argument. Poor people will almost always be less educated due to lack of opportunity. But there will be just as many intelligent people in that group as any other group. Intelligence is your ability to learn, not how much you know. 

What happens when we ensure a majority of our intelligent people can focus on advancing society?",2021-12-22 11:53:53

Juros de 5-10% ao ano em soluções de centralized finance (CeFi) como Nexo ou Celsius, para depósitos de stables como USDC e BUSD, ambas moedas emitidas por organizações centralizadas e com histórico de cooperação com os reguladores.

Juros de 10-20% ao ano em soluções de finanças descentralizadas (DeFi) como Curve, MakerDAO e Anchor Protocol, para depósitos de stablecoins completamente descentralizadas (Ex.: UST, DAI)  que também não são emitidas por entidades centrais como as mencionadas anteriormente.

teut_69420,"I'm a fresher and have an extremely weird take. Obviously learn your basics but most importantly learn how to learn. 

The learning curve for me has been extremely steep and it's hard. I'm an SDE in an IB but work as a big data engineer so I had to learn Java, many tools of CI/CD, spring, spring boot, Hadoop, hive, hbase, spark, Kafka, flume, AKS and docker. All of these in 5 months and more, i will be having to go through elastic search and cloud in the next few weeks. There were finance topics and basic stuff like jira which everyone has to learn so not counting here and many others which I definitely have forgotten.

So the best advice I can give is learn how to learn, I have felt the step up and to even have meaningful conversations about problems you are facing you need to know the tech stack completely, everything is linked. The thing I have understood is no one expects me to know these beforehand but I'm expected to learn them.

According-Object-502,"&gt;You’re getting downvoted and maybe it’s because of how you said it, but I think you are bang on.

I'm suprised I'm not getting down voted more. The truth hurts and people don't like hearing it. A tube driver in London earns £100k a year. That's just a tube driver and people are talking about £50k as if that makes them a highly qualifed high earner. 

If you take a random person earning 50k a year, say a recruitment consultant, they'll talk about the world as if they're Alan Sugar.  They think YOU should listen to them because they're sucessful and know things. The only thing they know is how to talk shit on the telephone and how to live pay cheque to cheque.

People are downvoting what I've said because it's them who I'm describing. Deep down inside they know they don't earn loads of money. They know they're no one important, they know no one gives a fuck about their instagram photos. No one cares when they see a photo of the one time you ate a starter in The Ivy. People rather just ignore their own reality because ignorance is bliss.

I live in a central London borough in a 2 bedroom flat. I know how much I earn and how much I've paid to live in a FLAT.  I don't regard myself as ""rich"". The house for sale on the next road is £25 million, and people are still pretending £50k a year makes them a high earner?! The year isn't 1982. 

If you think £50k a year is a lot a money, that just shows how far behind the information curve you really are. You're no where near the category of ""high earner"". That's why it seems like I'm talking about silly numbers. Being a high earner is not your reality. It's something you can't comprehend because that's not YOU. Get over over yourself and realise there's more to the world than your own little bubble where £50k a year is lot. 

Even somewhere in the north like Manchester, £500k isn't buying you a mansion. It's buying a NORMAL 3/4 bedroom detached house out the very outskirtks of the city. £250k is going to buy a studio flat/bedsit in the city center. All of this assumes the average person has a spare £50k in cash laying out to put down a deposit/cover other costs. Yet people think their £50k a year makes them an important high earner? They can't even buy a normal sized home on their own. They've got to get shacked up with someone they don't really love just so they can get a mortgage. That's not a ""high earner""

On top of this, the Government is artifically propping up the property market. The cut in stamp duty didn't benefited the average person. The guy on £50k a year didn't just buy a second home in Cornwall to work remotely from. He bought a trampoline or a hot tub on finance to put in his rented garden. That's the best it's going to get for them.

It might be blunt to say this stuff, but it doesn't mean I'm wrong. The average person is so full of their own bullshit, opinions and shit they've read on the internet. They're completely blind to the reality that they're not earning ""loads of money"". 

Everyday, the future standard of living for the average person is slipping further down the toliet. They're blissfully ignorant to the fact while sleep walking from pay cheque to cheque. They only pause for a moment so they can talk to someone like shit, post a staged photo on instagram, or to act outraged that their ""expert opinion"" isn't being taken seriously. 

I'm sorry to say, the average person in 2021 is an absolute fucking mug.",2021-12-22 22:57:21

marcuscontagius,"You seem to be implying that the treasury’s sole purpose is to sustain a high APY for the entirety of the runway? The minting/binding is what determines/sustains the APY, not the treasury…it’s why when minting rates are diminished so are rebase rates..

Glad you mentioned utility because that is the purpose of the treasury in the cases I mentioned.

If you’re at all familiar with the dynamics of the curve protocol and the role that the dao voting token plays in guiding pool reward rates, and by extension, pool liquidity then you would understand why the convex token (each of which controls ~6-7 crv voting tokens at the moment) is super important to terms of utility (google the curve wars). Add in the fact that convex has a capped supply and it’s pinwheel dynamics dictate it’s relative crv voting power per CVX token can only increase with time, and you have a pretty strong case for utility. Seems like a pretty smart capital allocation doesn’t it?

Pair this power to control, in effect, where people will put liquidity in curve (the largest protocol in defi) and you have a way to enhance whatever project you’ve invested in/seeded. You have a really effective way to provide lots of liquidity for your protocol. (Abracadabra/MIM was a classic example of this, and not surprisingly they are the same team behind wonderland finance). 

So now you’ve got the treasury full of cash to seed ideas and protocols or investments that you like and you control a mechanism to help protocols lock value and drive adoption to improve the odds of success and therefore a high ROI. 

The other example of deploying capital to drive revenue for stakers I mentioned was a position that returns 54 million/year on a 100 million stable coin investment. I’m not sure who you are but that isn’t really something many folks would sneeze at the way you did. Maybe you’re some investment whiz kid or something idk..if you do the math that’s a return of $7 on every $100 worth of TIME per year that someone holds and that’s only utilizing ~15% of the treasury for reference, Intel’s dividend is a return of $2.74 on every $100 held per year on 100% of the capital Intel deploys.

aNinjaWithAIDS,"&gt; I'd say what keeps it alive is global exploitation.

Capitalism is inherently exploitative and nothing else. As for a deeper look into the mechanisms that maintain capitalism and all other unjust economic models, I'll say it's these three things: corruption, propaganda, and warfare.

* Corruption to keep the tyrants' whims above the masses' needs.

* Propaganda to manufacture consent and acceptance from the oppressed.

* Warfare to expand its brand of exploitation and plunder on the tyrants' behalves.

&gt; How much would clothes cost if the people making them unionized and demanded fair wages, benefits and safe working conditions?

You may have intended this question to be rhetorical, but I think it's a fun one to discuss for two reasons particularly because of the example you used: clothes.

1. They have an [inelastic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/inelastic.asp) demand curve. The profit motive of capitalism *easily* abuses this as Eccentric Rants describes in [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI_qDCguCXM)

2. Clothes in of themselves tend to have a very small [marginal utility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginalutility.asp) rate. This means that people don't need that many of them to be truly satisfied for long periods of time.

ChottoTheFuck,"Not your keys not your coins.

When you lend your stables on Cefi options like hodlnaught, they are being used for more yields in defi applications such as those below.

Here are the defi alternatives if you wanna DIY and own everything.

1. Anchor protocol 19.5% on UST

2. AAVE on Polygon, deposit USDC, Borrow USDT, convert to USDC, redeposit that, rinse and repeat. Around 10-12% apy plus additional matic rewards, while hedging against USDT collapse.

3. Curve finance on Polygon. Liquidity mine USDC, DAI, USDT pair. 5% apy on fees, plus additional 2% in CRV and 3% in Matic.

4. Lending stables on Alpha Homora on Avalanche. Lend USDC, 9% APY on USDC, additional 4% in AVAX and 3% in Alpha.

5. Balancer on Polygon, liquidity provide on USDC/DAI/USDT/TUSD. 17% APR

6. Degenbox UST, this is absoulutely degenerate what else can I say. 100%+ apy on stables",2021-12-24 15:41:57
ChottoTheFuck,"I am currently ""risk on"" at the moment, so I don't do any stablecoin strategies right now but I am well aware of what I could do with stables as well and I am ready to switch to them if markets look choppy. So right now I run variations of the above strategies using crypto tokens instead of stables.

I currently use 2 of the above strategies and I am also using others that I have not described in the above.

Let me give you an example of what I am doing on AAVE right now, I deposit my Ethereum into AAVE, borrow USDT which has the most favorable borrow rates, convert that into DAI which has the most favorable deposit rates, redeposit that, and repeat once more to further increase yields while keeping a safe leverage ratio.

I would say the easiest if you want stablecoins yield is Anchor Protocol, just deposit it, easy 19.5% APY, no management, no farm tokens, no strategies whatsoever needed. However, Anchor is on the Terra blockchain so you would either have to use UST, or you would have to use a third party Ethereum aggregate like Orion Money if you still wish to stick with USDC. However, you will have to give them a cut and have it reduced to 16% APY. I have written a guide on how to use Anchor, but if thats not your thing you can use Alpha Homora as well, thats pretty nice and easy.

If you are just dealing with stablecoins, your risk is considerably less however you still have to watch out for depegging, and smart contract risk. For instance, 4 days ago, the auto compounder Grim Finance had a bug in it's code and someone exploited it to drain the protocol of all of its funds. $30 Million worth of Fantom tokens were stolen, all who used Grim Finance lost it all. Grim finance was apparently also an audited protocol so this was a shock to many.

Smart contract risk is unavoidable but it can be mitigated by using battle tested protocols.

Reputable protocols who have multi chain adoption like AAVE &amp; Curve is way safer than newer protocols such as Alpha Homora (although this one is pretty safe too). You want to use protocols which have higher TVLs as it would have more financial backing and be able to have a more robust development team and audit companies.

kola401,"I missed this message. Let's dissect your argument

&gt;Pair this power to control, in effect, where people will put liquidity in curve (the largest protocol in defi) 

Isn't curve for stablecoins? Wonderland TIME isn't a stablecoin.

&gt;and you have a way to enhance whatever project you’ve invested in/seeded.

I don't get this argument. Why would curve be used to fund liquidity for Wonderland? It's a stablecoin DEX. 

&gt;So now you’ve got the treasury full of cash to seed ideas and protocols or investments that you like and you control a mechanism to help protocols lock value and drive adoption to improve the odds of success and therefore a high ROI.

That's just a bloated argument. Is the ROI better than the value taken away from liquidity? $1B stolen from the marketcap and they are using a % of that to invest against fiat inflation rate.

And your argument doesn't mention the risk of DEFI so the risk of a complete loss is although unlikely, still possible. Not only they have to beat the inflation rate of their stablecoin treasury, they can't invest the entirety of their treasury, only in small amounts.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;returns 54 million/year on a 100 million stable coin investment

Except the treasury isn't $100M isn't it. It's close to $1B. What's the inflation rate per year of $1B? Im guessing minimum around $10M per year

These returns are insignificant to investors.

&gt;If you do the math that’s a return of $7 on every $100 worth of TIME per year that someone holds and that’s only utilizing \~15% of the treasury for reference,

Except you forgot to mention they can't invest 100% of their treasury. It's too high risk. If they invest in smaller amounts, the returns will always be less than the value taken away from the liquidity of the coin.

In traditional finance, you can easily invest billions because there's enough protection in place with unlimited printing.

In DEFI, a protocol mistake, high fees or congestion means you can easily lose much if not all your investments. Your argument is flawed because Wonderland can't utilize the majority of their treasury enough to cover for the massive bubble they created by taking the liquidity away from the open market.",2021-12-25 07:04:59

I also worked in investment banking and my entire circle of friends either work in management consulting or banking. I know the type of guys that land internships at BB banks at Wall Street, I'm definitely not one of them. You need to study at a renowned university, have excellent grades and pass various intelligence tests to be even invited to 5-6 rounds of highly rigorous interviews. My IQ is around ~140 and I struggle to keep up with my peers. The guys working in high-level finance are freaks, it's crazy.",2021-12-27 12:16:59
SecretaryOtherwise87,"The question is in which direction (subset of finance) you want to take your career in the long run.
Do you aim for corporate finance/ IBD/ Consulting? Do you want to go into S&amp;T? Quant research?
As of now, being proficient in either Python or R and having a good understanding of statistics/ probability is likely going to put you ahead of the General curve (obviously not if you want to be a quant). Most of it will potentially be wasted in a traditional Corp fin/ IBD role, though on the consulting side these technical skills are mich more in demand than they have been two years ago.
As such, learning ML is likely not a bad choice if you want to go into a quantitative role. It certainly adds more value than a CFA, at least when pure learning is concerned. ;)",2021-12-27 16:51:48

tradegreek,"I think the key is really more about how well you can signal your understanding of the role in regards to your actual duties and day-to-day work. The only two hesitancies a firm would have as far as I can see are inter-firm dynamics in that it could be weird to hire a 42-year-old in the same role as a 21-year-old. In theory, it doesn't matter, however, in reality, you can only expect that the 42-year-old would have different wants and needs to the 21-year-old. I don't think it's unreasonable to assume the 42-year-old would desire a faster career trajectory as well as salary. Therefore I think it's important you are aware that this isn't feasible and so you probably need to work on getting it across that you are looking for the same sort of career trajectory as the 21-year-old. This isn't to say that you emphasize that you are just looking to learn and grow your skillset etc. I feel like this would be a mistake as let's face it anyone who has done grad schemes knows that at first the learning curve can feel exponentially but it does slow down dramatically after a while depending on how technical the role is etc. Therefore I think it's important that you can also get across that you are also just willing to grind hard and really understand what the sort of day-to-day work is whether that's writing endless pitchbooks or finishing models etc. 

I personally think that if you are older and looking to break in you really need to focus on smaller shops (depending on what area of finance you want to break into, you haven't really implied where so I am being generic). I think the smaller offices will allow you (if you have the ability / competence) to thrive and have faster career progression than if you apply to a larger / more hierarchical instituion. Ultimately I think that for the most part grad schemes/entry jobs aren't that enjoyable after that initial learning curve starts to flatten as they are more boring/repetitive (my experience was 5 years in Investment Banking in London at an elite bank). Therefore my worry in hiring someone older is that they would be less willing to just do the grind and get it over with. At a smaller shop, you will get a lot more responsibility and earlier on as well as probably have to work more dynamically across multiple workstreams, etc. where the grind will take longer to sink in.",2021-12-29 02:20:48

ciarandeceol1,"Just my opinion but avoid ETFs. You get rode by the 8 year deemed disposal tax here in Ireland. Take a look at ""investment trusts"" instead. You can think of them as a curated group of stocks chosen and managed by hedge fund managers. A popular and high performing one is Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust. Don't let the name fool you, they don't have much to do with mortgages, and are global facing. Baillie Gifford is the group who manages this fund and SMIT is their flagship trust. They have the benefit of being able to invest in non-publically listed companies also. Note: there are other trusts than Baillie Gifford's Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust.

Have you thought about decentralised finance? A regulated and insured platform like Nexo will allow you to grow your idle euros by giving a daily percentage interest. Up to 12% with Nexo. 

For some reason this subreddit hates crypto. I think it's just that Ireland is generally a bit behind the curve on upcoming tech. Whether people like it or not though, web3 is happening and it will become more mainstream over time. You could look at some web3 crypto projects with potential.

RonMexico2005,"Responding to: ""Could someone make a bearish case for digital assets \[for 2022\]?""

Personally I am bullish, but here are my bear notes:

A - there are two recurring (for several years) crypto mainstream media stories: (1) Bitcoin is volatile, and (2) Shitcoin of the week was a fraud, and sympathetic victims lost a lot of money. This news cycle has forestalled and likely will continue to forestall faster digital asset adoption.

B - new for 2021 is recurring mainstream news story (3) artist lights a painting on fire (or similar), records it as an NFT, someone pays a fortune for it.  This story is working to instill in the mind of the general public that ""NFT = joke"" much like the general public ""doesn't get"" art in general, or associates fancy restaurants with tiny portions; and more broadly makes the NFT an acronym for ""Not For Them."" So this skewed perception by the general public is likely to forestall digital asset adoption.

C - whenever asked about it in the news, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon says he thinks Bitcoin is worthless. The general public knows that in America, you don't get to be CEO of a company as large as JP Morgan by being stupid or by being related to someone in the ruling political party, you get there by being among the best at what you do and outcompeting tons of smart, motivated people. And while people expect CEO's to talk their own book of business (i.e. traditional finance in this case) and take what they hear with a grain of salt, they're still taking it in. What the CEO of one of the largest American banks thinks about the future of finance is relevant to the future of finance whether you think he is wrong (and whether he is in actual fact wrong) or not.

So the mainstream media has for years had a multi-headed anti-digital assets campaign, with new additions as technology advances (e.g. NFT's in 2021). And while digital assets have been marching up in spite of this, at some point, it will really need buy-in from the general public.  On the well-known technology adoption curve, we are probably in the early stages of ""early adopters,"" and the real take-off comes when the ""early majority"" shows up.  Which may or may not happen, and can be heavily influenced by propaganda, including what is being fed to the general public.

Why is the media against digital assets?  They are not so much against them as they are strongly for protecting the incumbent rich people and social order. Once the incumbents like Visa (who pay for media advertising heavily) figure out how to squash the upstarts like Flexa, the media will embrace digital assets with open arms.  Until then it is a threat.  The way for Flexa to overcome the threat, survive, and prosper, is to partner with other incumbents like the big banks, to supplant the payment processing incumbents like Visa.  You have a fair chance to win an incumbent vs. incumbent fight in a regulated industry.  You don't really have a fair chance in a startup vs. incumbent fight. Not to say you can't win, but the deck is stacked against you.",2021-12-30 01:15:37

complexsystems,"With your profile, I'd advise against pursuing graduate school in economics, given what you've posted here &amp; elsewhere. First, you're likely not competitive at a \~US top 30 programs, nor at top 4 Canadian. For perspective, going to \*econ\* graduate school for \~6 years will likely lead to an expected salary less than $150k if you stay in or adjacent to academia (think tanks, central banks, professor at a school), and strictly cost you salary subject to the $30-40k/yr stipend students typically get.

That stated, with a background in EE, you likely have the requisite math at some point, and you'll just want to credibly signal you've kept up competencies in those areas (multivariate calculus, linear algebra). Your MBA experience will be highly discounted, but as long as you can show you have an interest in economics (and phds in marketing/finance pay off even better than econ, and perhaps reconnecting with the prof suggesting the phd in analytics is a way to go) you still might get in. If your school is known to curve harshly, you can assume admissions committees are vaguely aware of it, and upwards trajectory in grades is good, particularly if you did well in capstone math courses. While I haven't done admissions, the further away from school the less people care about it, and showing you're interested and knowledgeable about what it takes to succeed as a research economist is the biggest hurdle you'll face.

nv42o,"poker vs roulette. nice idea, that‘s an analogy i can get behind. 
Unfortunately from an academic perspective there is no way to consistently beat the market. Markets have been proven information efficent for over a hundred years. Not only is every information priced in, you have to think bigger, every expectation, every small event, every possible scenario is accumulated into the price you see.

However, to come back to your roulette wheel. the stock market can be viewed as a roulette wheel where there are 19 red and 18 black fields (no zero). Would this be gambling from your POV? Because this is actually how markets function. you have daily returns on a bell curve but if you transform it into a dummy variable you‘d get something like the skewed roulette board. 
if you bet on red maybe you will lose sometime but due to the rule of large numbers, in the end you will have made a profit. The red fields in Finance would be going long as we can observe a positive mean return. if it were different, going short would be also viable.",2021-12-30 22:12:36

lostandfound1,"Hey mate, old timer here (I've got 8 years on you!).

I've been getting in to personal finance lately, so can share some broad guidelines that I've read or listened to on podcasts. Can't say I've been this disciplined myself, but I personally want to get better at this stuff so I can maximise my future opportunities. Don't take this as expert advice, I'm just some schmuck on a learning curve like you. 

Emergency fund: you have $12k saved. That's a great achievement. Make that your emergency fund. Needs to be enough to last you 4-6 months if you lose your job and can't find another quickly. Sounds like a very good amount.

Savings; most guides say aim for 20% of income (post tax). Your after tax pay is about $42500, meaning you might be able to target $8500/yr so $700/ month. You can do more if you go full-monk-style, but that's down to your priorities and needs. Could impact the low stress lifestyle, so keep it all in perspective. 

Investments. Well, that's the tricky part. It's not actually tricky, but it depends on you, your goals, what you're after. #thisisnotfinancialadvice If you want property, look into the 'first home super saver scheme'. It's a way of making extra contributions to super for a deposit, then taking them out when you are about to buy. It's apparently good for minimising tax on capital gains and making sure your savings are earning interest. Downside is the rules are complicated (because it involves government policy) but apparently it's a good way of getting that deposit. Haven't done it myself, but apparently it stacks up if you are keen on property and willing to deal with a bit of paperwork.

If you want to go for an investment portfolio, you could contribute more to super. It's good for tax, but you pointed out there is a massive downside in not being able to touch it until 67yo. For me personally, that rules it out until I hit late 50s-early60s. You could do the same outside super and it would be liquid (ie you can access the funds if you want to buy a house, start a family etc)

Better option is to get a low fee brokerage account and invest in indexed ETFs. To keep it simple, look at Vanguard and their passive ETF tracking the asx300. #notfinancialadvice

Look in to other options as well, but decision paralysis is your worse enemy here. If you find a low fee, passive, index tracking ETF and want to go down the 'invest money in shares' route, just start throwing that 20% of income in there. Look in to other ETFs, then maybe stocks as you learn, but if your index and fees are good and low, it's a great option. 

Google money smart compound interest calculator, put your deposit and regular contributions in and throw a 10% interest rate compounding monthly and see what your net wealth might do. That's a good approximation of the share market growth, #notingthatpastperformanceisnotanindicatoroffutureperformance

That sets up some good starts. Get that bubbling away in the background, then go figure out what you want out of all this. Career, retirement, financial independence, travel, whatever. The good financial setup should be there to support your goals.",2021-02-01 19:01:53

Sneaky_Jim,"Are you settled on going 20% down? You can also get a high ratio mortgage (a default insured mortgage) for 5 or 10% down. I think there's strong arguments for either way. High ratio is much more risky, but will get you a higher ROI on your downpayment over a few years. 

Regardless, I'm not sure that putting your entire savings into one piece of real estate co-owned by your dad is the best strategy. From a returns perspective you probably won't even beat equities, especially when considering compound growth, unless housing market goes up, which you can't really count on. Plus, all this equity is illiquid, locked into the property, and you could end up having to write a cheque to get out, should the real estate market tank. You definitely don't want that. 

I think it's best to stay liquid and in ETFs. Stock picking is a loser's game unless you have information or strategies unmatched by the rest of the market, which I bet you don't.

dazplot,"The short answer, as someone who was in your position but ended up working for Japanese companies, is that there probably isn't any way to reach true business level without throwing yourself into a sink-or-swim immersive environment.

That said, ""business level"" can mean different things. My jobs have required meeting with clients and joining conference calls, taking minutes, writing reports, stuff like that. It was a brutally steep learning curve. If you're in engineering or IT, it may be enough just to communicate with your team and focus on a specific range of vocabulary. Both of these things are business level, but they are fairly different. Also, there are jobs out there that mix English and Japanese, which would be a more comfortable learning environment.

Again, though, if you're like me you won't learn how to talk about finance and contract law and shipping terms and budget meetings etc. if you're not repeatedly forced to, so just ask yourself if you really want to take that path.

investorinvestor,"In the world of Existing Monetary Theory (EMT), your thesis would probably hold some water. Unfortunately, since the 2008 crash we've been living in some sort of bizarro monetary environment, which I'll refer to as the world of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). Allow me to begin my rebuttal using your post as a jumping-off point: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And here lies the problem, interest rate cannot go into the negative because people and companies would rather withdraw money from the bank and hold them in the form of banknotes which would NOT carry the negative component. 

If you look at vast swaths of the Eurozone, many Euro member countries are not just at negative rates on the central bank rate, but some are even negative across the entire yield curve. The reason why 100-year govt bonds gained prominence (infamy?) was because everything else was already negative; so if you wanted that geographic exposure, 100-year govies were the best you were going to get. 

But I digress; back to the point. If you study the savings rates of the Euro member countries currently with negative nominal interest rates, their savings rate have actually gone UP since negative rates started. This flies completely in the face of EMT and in fact common sense itself, but that's in fact what has happened in our MMT world. The hindsight justification is that people are expecting things to get worse, therefore they are even more motivated to build their rainy day fund - in the expectation that they'll soon have to hunker down and hibernate. Of course, this may not be directly attributable to negative rates alone - LTRO and its descendants can potentially share a lot of that blame as well. But it doesn't change the fact that negative interest rates doesn't automatically = people won't save. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How will they avoid financial armageddon? The answer is by artificially manufacturing enough inflation to move away from the Zero area and thus have the Interest rate follow suit and move away from the Zero Lower Bound.

This is what the ECB has been trying to do for the past 8 years. Remember Draghi's ""Whatever It Takes""? That was 2012. It still hasn't caused the inflation we were hoping for yet, and 8 years is an eternity - both in markets and at the individual lifespan level. For reference, the Great Depression (by its longest definition) lasted 12 years, and was long enough to write a scar into history itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's not important because the goal is always the same: inundating consumers with cash in the hope that they feel rich enough to start consuming again (acting on the impulse of purchasing again) and stop saving/investing (being fearful of the future and behaving in a risk averse manner) 

Well, the counterpoint to that is: that's exactly what we've done for the past decade. It may not have been helicopter money (which actually happened in 2020, btw); but our central banks have gone to some gymnastic-level lengths with nothing much to show for so far - except the longest bull market in stocks in history. 

Why might this be the case? Because when entrepreneurs, the building block of the economy, are not confident enough that they will turn a profit on their investments, they won't borrow to invest. So all that extra money flows into either 1) non-productive ""expenses"" (vs ""assets"") (e.g. a second home, speculative stocks, pipe dreams) or 2) higher-yielding investments from a risk:reward perspective (i.e. justifying higher prices for lower-yielding investments). If the expected value from starting a business is negative, why would you bother? You'd just invest in something else that would yield a less-than-satisfactory return. 

As a result, GDP growth slows. With lower productivity output, companies have to reduce expenses. Salaries/jobs get cut, people spend less, and the cycle perpetuates. This is evident in the ever-declining velocity of money. The lynchpin of Keynesian countercyclical policy is animal spirits, and if you can't poke the bull hard enough to chase the bear away, the whole theory falls apart. 

Hence, the easy money policy of the last 10 years (around the world) have shown that simply inundating consumers with cash only raises prices in isolated pockets of the economy, while leaving the rest untouched. Hence the term ""K-shaped recovery"". We've actually seen this before btw, Japan has pretty much been like this since the early 2000s. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As said earlier G-20 governments/Central Banks will be forced to manufacture some inflation and that would carry the Treasury bonds rate upwards as well (because savers would not bid over each other anymore for the privilege of lending to the Government at 0.25% because that would not protect them against inflation anymore) 

First of all, governments/central banks do not feel at all obligated/compelled to manufacture inflation for the purpose of carrying the Treasury rate above the ZLB. It is simply not their top-of-mind concern. The fact that so many govts have already allowed negative rates shows that there are other concerns which take precedence over simply having a positive central bank rate. (still remember Trump insisting on negative rates?) 

Second, savers have in fact bid over each other for exactly the privilege of earning a pittance - because they think that rates might go further negative. Just take a look at the recent Aussie issue at negative rates - demand far outstripped supply. TSLA is another current example - at its current valuation, you'd be earning a pittance ROI even if you were right on the money; yet very intelligent people still champion it. The problem isn't inadequate absolute returns; the problem is even worse relative returns. 

&amp;#x200B;

I could actually write an entire essay on why in our world today the influence of MMT has probably superseded EMT, and how the dismal science has booked a holiday to Oz and doesn't intend to come back. 

It's a mistake to think that post-Covid was the start of the Great Monetary Experiment (coincidentally ""GME""); we've actually already been living in it since at least 2012. How else can you explain the joyless bull run (where every year is a calamity); ultra-low volatility (supported by telegraphed central bank expectations); the Central Bank put (markets being rescued by 2012's ""Whatever It Takes"", 2016's PBOC capital controls, 2018's Powell Calm, and 2020's ""Spend up to your limit, and then spend a bit more""). Markets in the last decade have been as far away from *laissez-faire* as you can define it, and if Hayek could see this he would be rolling in his grave so fast that you could hook him up to a generator. Keynes on the other hand would probably be rolling in reverse from victory. 

You should be commended on a great effort, there is no doubt about that. But unfortunately everyone at the highest level of finance has already thought about this at least once, and reality has proven that EMT no longer holds true. Welcome to the new world of MMT.",2021-02-03 23:21:53

&amp;#x200B;

You posted on a career advice sub and spent the entire post discussing your depression.  It's time to look after your mental health.  You have some of the same problems many of your peers have (Graduating 2 years later than you predicted isn't a bad thing. Progress isn't a straight line and you will take plenty of 2 year detours in various ways in your life).  You've got a mental health condition and we're in the middle of a pandemic that makes a lot of those issues worse. It would be a good idea to prioritize mental health (seeing a doctor and therapist immediately).  Your situation does not make me feel hopeless, so if it makes you feel hopeless, that's an indication your perception is worse than your reality. 

&amp;#x200B;

On to the career side of things:  You have a bachelor's degree in finance and some work experience. That's plenty enough to get hired for a decent-paying job.  You aren't trapped, you aren't behind the curve, and you aren't unqualified. You're good to go!  You can work in any of thousands of jobs that simply require a college degree, or you can get a job in your actual field. Sure, you'll need to play the numbers game by applying to lots of jobs and interviewing until you get hired, but that's what we all did.  

This isn't really a tough love post, despite how it sounds. If I had to sum up the advice, it would be this:  Your depression is making the situation seem worse than it is. If you address the depression, you'll find you're actually in pretty good shape to take a step back, breathe a little, apply for some jobs and see what you like doing. We have way more time than we think. Many of us think our careers are a big race where every month counts, but it's just not true. The company I built helps thousands of people find a job every year. I see this at every career level.  People rush out the gates after college, they compare themselves to everyone, then they eventually realize everyone around you is just focused on their own careers, their own doubts, their own stuff.  Your career is going to be fine.  Depression doesn't go away when you get a job.  Take care of yourself, and your career will be waiting for you!",2021-02-09 00:18:12

ImADaveYouKnow,"Partially yes. There's a lot more to it than just smooth transfers of crypto. Crypto currencies are only one small part of blockchain technology these days. Take DeFi coins for example.

The coins you see that are DeFi coins actually support an application. DeFi means ""Decentralized Finance"" so these kinds of blockchains do what a bank would do, but without a company behind it. So, lets say you want to take out a loan. You could fill out a ""smart contract"" on one of the DeFi platforms to take out a loan. Then, according to the parameters set on the contract, you pay it back or lose the asset you staked (usually in the form of a down payment). All of this happens without any human intervention.

The ""coins"" associated with these DeFi dapps are what power the transactions. The machines that process these transactions are ""paid"" in the currency of the platform. As the platform grows, the coins appreciate in value.

Polkadot provides an easy framework to build and host these kinds of applications. So instead of a developer having to design a blockchain from scratch, then program what the contracts should look like, then provide security protocols, etc. Polkadot handles all of that.

decideonanamelater,"Addressing the tibalt thing, they would never release tibalt as a split card.

Also, lurrus was not a free addition to an aggro deck in standard at least. If there was a free companion, it was/is yorion. Most standard aggro decks have the curve go at least to 4. Lurrus was honestly at least close to fine in standard.

I didn’t say he should be a split card, I said MDFCs should follow the same kind of **rules** as split cards: CMC = sum of both sides CMC except on stack or battlefield (where it is the chosen side’s CMC).

I am not a 100% familiar with the exact decks that existed in that meta. However, in the current meta, Rogues can use Lurrus for free, and it’s still a very good inclusion despite the nerf. Pre-nerf it’d have been absolutely broken, so I disagree that most aggro decks wouldn’t find use for it. If anything, the current states of Gruul “Aggro” going up till 4+ CMC is the exception, not the rule.

I think the people who demand that new sets should have no impact are being very unreasonable. However, the current state is a *far* cry from what they are asking for. Every set seems to have multiple cards that completely rotate the format and add 1-2 brand new decks to deal with. It’s not fun for most players at this point.",2021-02-09 11:33:05
BeepBoop6765,"Hey there,

Thank you for sharing this with us.

I’m assuming you are UK based.

There are so many things I want to tell you, but it will take me an eternity to write, but here he go:

1) I’m actually having some therapy as well. NHS waiting times are indeed crazy so I’m paying for it myself, but it’s costing me £100 per session... how fucked up is that?

2) The times after study and before finding a career can be very daunting. I perfectly understand. I know you tired to get into uni twice already, but going from high school to industry is a huge step. I would strongly advise you try uni again, but this time you will hopefully have someone by your side (see following point).

3) Being bad at maths is relative. You might not be good enough for a high level technologic job, but in finance, there are some good entry jobs, and you don’t need to be super good at maths, particularly accounting.

4) I am a perfectionist at heart, and it affects my life significantly. I cannot get rid of it, but I can steer it to the positive spectrum, which actually makes me very proud of being one.

5) Automation will take over low wage jobs, and I am sorry to tell you that I currently work on automating something that people hire warehouses upon warehouses of poor Indian people to sit there 12 hours a day to do every day. I actually have quite the strong opinion on this, so I would prefer not to publicly state it :P but I invite anyone who is interested to have an interesting debate on this to let me know :)
But in summary OP, I want to tell you that by the time a machine takes over your job, you would have already progressed to the next stage of your career. Humans progress faster than machines, so you will always be ahead of the curve, specially you being very young.

6) don’t predict homelessness in 20 years, come on... the world is changing so fast everyday that any prediction over 1 month is almost pointless. You could be homeless tomorrow or never.

7) You are not a mistake, you are not a worthless  piece of shit! I know you feel like that, so I will just have to show you otherwise :)

If you need anyone to talk with, to listen to you and make you feel less lonely in these times, I am here any time any day! Don’t throw your life away for this! ❤️",2021-02-09 21:29:17

resilienceisfutile,"My reason for calling it overrated was because the company holds many more cards than you do in terms of protection cards.  You do not necessarily keep YOUR job, but you keep A job at the company -- HR will help you once you return from parental leave (in Canada it is either parent or as a combination of the two for leave).  In my wife's job (her job is specialized), it is up to your reporting manager to keep the spot open and covered (her spot wouldn't fit a contractor well because learning curve and security) until you return if you can keep that spot.  My wife knows coworkers who have been replaced by new workers and are never seen in the same role after their mat leave is done, so they outright quit (lose any chance of a package) or work on another account which hearing the conversations is like starting all over with new managers, new environment, and no feeling of seniority.  The worst my wife has seen was a DBA being laid off the day after she returned; she called my wife to see if she had any leads or a spot on her account team and my wife was gutted at hearing this.  HR gives you resources to find another job within the company, a desk at a hotelling location, a desktop computer, turn in your laptop and cell phone, and start the countdown because you got 2 months starting now.  It happens when the company has 35,000+ people worldwide. 

So this is where some of the bending of the rules happen and her industry is not a lonely island as we have heard it from her university IT friends, my friends that I left in banking and finance (it is bad there as your job is instantly replaceable in the back office), and research.  You will get calls to put out fires, they will pick your brain, they will ask you to help and what do you say?  ""No, I am on leave.""  Unless you manager (or in the case of my wife, the client team requested her return to the account) is going to be out there to protect you, your position could be jeopardized and you are at the mercy of the corporation.

Factory jobs like at Ford Canada, you can move up the chain a bit to a better spot on the line when you get back because unions will go to hell and back for you.  Pretty much any unionized job will keep you in your spot.  And teachers leave for a year the union is so strong and there are enough teachers in supply and as LTOs.  Smaller companies appreciate their workers more and you don't hear as many stories there.

If corporations like the types my wife and friends work for would guarantee a spot in the same role, then I would say, not overrated.  But laid off the day after you get back?  That is no protection at all and someone in each country maliciously complying with the rules.",2021-02-09 23:08:40
AnimalTom23,"I’m on that road now. Late 20s with 300k+.

My investments are irrelevant... sort of. Used to be mutual funds, now it’s indexed ETFs. But the vast majority of the early wealth was working and being frugal.

I’ve worked as a janitor, cashier, fixed cars, for the government, in bars, you name it. I’ve always worked 50 hours a week with little reprieve - even if I really didn’t make that much money. At the start of Covid I even found a job collecting trash/labourer at a construction site when I was laid off. I have no shame in the work I do and I always take pride in any job, I truly strive to be the model employee. Worth noting that I do have two degrees and was unable to find meaningful work in either field. Although one of those degrees was general arts, I think it taught me more than my specialized finance one. It taught me to be rational and how to critically think. I feel that is why I am usually able to see the larger picture in most situations.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’ve been to a few continents, many bars, many festivals and shows, and many other adventures (I also definitely missed out on a ton too). But I always approached it with the financial cost in the back of my mind.

Nowadays I have begun to relax a little more when it comes to money. My investment accounts should pull in around 20k per year and I do continue to plan to grow that. But, the knowledge that I could theoretically work on minimum wage and live of my nest egg (comfortably) is awesome. I do not plan to live that way, but it gives me the option to.

The most important thing I can share is to develop a good work ethic. For every shit job I have had I am always genuinely shocked that some people routinely mail it in, show up late, give attitude to their superiors, etc. There is no secret - Show up, take pride in your work even if it sucks, say yes to everything, then go home and work on personal goals (or have fun). That one sentence has taken care of the rest of my life. No matter what the work is, if you feel it is beneath you - it isn’t. There is no shame in bagging groceries or mopping floors.


Judging by your post, you are missing the core concept of generating wealth. The vast majority will come from when you deposit in the account, not what the account generates (at least at the start). Get rich quick schemes exist, but only on the right tail of the bell curve. Meaning that are few and far between, and even moreso - just luck. Don’t rely on luck. Create as many opportunities as you can and luck will find it’s way to you in the little ways.",2021-02-09 23:15:39
scruffmgckdrgn,"My father was a bank manager who somehow managed to avoid ever teaching me anything about how to deal with money, and my mother is absolutely terrible with her money. I make about the same as you do, and started out in basically the same financial situation. My primary ""advantage"" over your situation is that I don't have kids, so I *can* spend a bunch of time figuring out how to use the program. 

The learning curve for YNAB is steep, and I can no longer say why, because I've figured it out. It's weird, and it may just be because like you I had basically no financial education, but I felt really stupid for maybe two months before I settled in and was comfortable using the program. That's not to say I can use it to its fullest extent, but I'm better off than I *was* earlier. I also still don't understand much of what ""most people"" understand about personal finance, and I learn this stuff pretty slowly. 

In numbers, I am up in net worth by a little over eleven thousand dollars since Jan 2020. Some amount of that will probably not be replicable post-COVID stimulus checks, but I only had two months on boosted unemployment, so a fair amount of it is me and the program. In terms of ""non-scale victories"", I have *very* little stress over my financial situation now, and that loss of anxiety is even better reward to me than the money. 

I found that the hardest speedbumps to get past were emotional; the anxiety I'd feel over fully *seeing* how bad my situation was was something I would avoid by *refusing to use the program* so that I no longer felt that anxiety. That fear was keeping me from improving my situation. 

I don't know how long you've been working on understanding YNAB, but I hope you can stick to it. I honestly believe you have more than enough intelligence to understand it, and that it will help you once you do. The barrier is probably fear, and if you can conquer that, you can vastly improve your life.",2021-02-09 23:25:48
agjios,"My credit union did the same thing. First off, they can't tell you your rate until they see the vehicle. A 2012 F-150 with 164,000 miles will have a different rate (or might not even get approved) compared to a 2019 Camry with 31,000 miles.

So, when I went to the dealership, I let them run my credit, in case anything fell through with the credit union, and to prove that I could be approved for the car that they were showing me. Once we agreed on a price, I went to the finance manager. The dealership couldn't beat my credit union rate, so the finance manager faxed some things back and forth with my credit union.

Manitcor,"That question is often a loaded one that starts with that and then goes but XX coin has this and XX coin has that so your coin should not exist. I am not really interested in that game if that is the goal here. Rather than bullet list, I will just provide what brought me to using Algo. 

I personally become aware of Algo about 5 months ago and had been following it a bit as one tends to when looking for another promising coin to invest in. I was first interested as I am a Boston area local and like to support things that are local. As I followed it more I learned that the project was founded by an Economist with a PHD in the field and works as a professor at MIT. This got me even more interested as ""tokenomics"" is often what makes or breaks a coin longer term and someone with a strong economics background (as opposed to software dev or marketing or other fields as so many coins are started/headed by) could really put in place some policies that make a coin more usable long term. 

It was at this point I bought my first bit of algo and just kind of let it sit, organically learning more about the protocol as news released. The network is interesting in that its looking at all the use cases developing for crypto and rather than trying to accommodate those use cases after the coin is popular the coin is designed from the ground up as an attempt to actually be a global financial network capable of actually serving the globe. This is becoming more common in newer coins as people have watched how having a protocol that leaves out important details like scaling for later can lock the coins progress as it becomes popular. I was somewhat skeptical about the claims being made however from using the technology in just moving coins around I think there is promise here on speed along. The protocol is capable of completing a transaction in mere seconds. As an example 2 days ago I moved a bunch of coins to a wallet, by the time I was done telling my wife about the move the funds were already in the walled, fully confirmed and ready to use. There may be other fast coins (I have heard of a few) but this is the first I have used myself and it is quite impressive. 

As I bought more ALGO I became more aware of the staking and how it worked, I stake multiple coins using the myriad of ways that are available from protocol level staking to soft staking provided by 3rd parties. Algo's interest system caught my eye due to its somewhat high return rate 7-7.5% but also the fact that it was unique in its protocol staking system, requiring no locking of coins and no long wait times to begin receiving awards. You are allowed to move your coins around at will and the staking system will automatically adjust your rewards on the spot, no 20-30 day rolling periods, no lock ups, no waits to unlock. 

Then while trying to buy some crypto on Kucoin I realized getting Fiat over there is a pain, and moving ETH based coins or BTC would cost a fortune relatively. This is where I discovered that a quickly growing number of exchanges work with Algo. Since then I have also started using my Algo as a float for moving money between exchanges. The fees are extremely low and the speed is so fast making it one of my favorite mediums of transfer at the moment (we will see how things go as the network grows). As of now, Algo is the only coin I regularly actually use for something that is not investing or trading (its just moving money but still doing that fast and cheap is a lot of utility on its own) and I have pushed more across the algo network in utility functions than I have all the other coins I have used combined. 

Finally as I got around to really reading the whitepaper and details I really appreciated how the coin's value is considered. Algo as a technology and as an economic tool is not designed to ""go to the moon"" like other coins. It is meant to have a level of stability and somewhat predictable price growth as to better facilitiate international finance transactioins, from something as small as a coffee (yes algo can do true mini and micro payment) all the way up to major international banks exchanges billions all at high speeds. As a matter of fact there are built in mechanisms to control price when it attempts to go parabolic like other coins. This is done to offset the volatility often seen in other coins as well as to try and prevent crashing back down lower than the previous mean (which can happen with those big spikes due to panic selling). Some people liken it to price manipulation, but its really all there in the white paper and I credit the strategy as to why algo's price action seems to be somewhat unique in the crypto world. 

There are other features I have yet to really dig into yet myself but they are all fairly interesting though I would also say fairly standard fare when it comes to this generation of coins:

* smart contracts (dex, liquidity pools, etc)
* tokenization of arbitrary items (other coins, stocks, physical assets, etc) 
* voting based governance

There are likely more features I have missed or poorly explained, but that is how I came around to really liking algo and hoping it has a future as a real utility in the world.

There are certainly a host of other coins that boast similar features, some on the market some in various stages of development. And algo is just one of multiple newer coins in my portfolio, though I will admit the recent bull run took algo from an average stake among the portfolio to one of my largest stakes out of all my coins. I just really hope the price stays more stable this time due to the lest volatile growth curve.",2021-02-10 23:21:02

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies.",2021-02-12 06:15:23

LifelnDefault,"Having a professional background in finance helps from a learning curve perspective. Those with finance backgrounds have to put a little less effort into learning technicals relative to a pure career switchers that have never looked at a P&amp;L before.

I recruited amongst CFAs and CPAs and while they were able to get their foot in the door with banks quite easily, I don't believe they were materially better off than career switchers because cultural fit and personality are far more important than technical proficiency. A few classmates had significant M&amp;A and capital raising experience and they were by far the most sought after.

As every banker will say, technical proficiency is a ""check the box"". Johnson gives every IB candidate enough resources to ""check the box"" with every firm.

It's been a couple weeks nice then, so I'm just trying to figure out next steps for my career.   
I unfortunately have not attempted any since passing exam P, not to make any excuses but the start of the pandemic put my family's small business to work and I ended up helping for several months full time.   


I used TheInfiniteActuary (TIA) for my study material for exam P and plan to use them again for FM. I noticed they have a ""technical course"" package that seems like it could be useful as well?

Luminis_The_Cat,"Hi, I'm one of the co-op students that was involved with the Workday launch. I understand your struggle and there are inevitably things that will have changed for the worse, but overall, Workday is replacing a 25-year old, paper-based system. It had to be done eventually. There is a learning curve to it. I'm sorry that you had a negative experience, but there is also a lot of people, especially on the HR and Finance side, who really appreciated how easier things are for them now.

As with every large scale implementation, there are upsides and downsides. While your job may have gotten harder, other people's jobs may have gotten easier. Overall, I believe that switching to Workday is a good decision overall. Yes, learning a whole new system is tough. Yes, there will be a lot of confusion. But we cannot rely on old systems if we want to move forward.

P.S. I have a decent knowledge of Workday, feel free to PM me your questions and let's see if my drunk ass has any idea of what to do with them",2021-02-13 15:30:09

I actually spoke to a recruiter about an operations role at Barclays but passed on it as they are still using older and on-prem stuff for the next couple of years until they move into cloud (their cloud team is based down in Chester), also had initial chats/interviews at Morgan Stanley, Moodys and another bank but went with a much smaller firm in the end as the banks are quite slow to move and a lot were using Windows &amp; Azure but I much prefer working with linux &amp; AWS. I was doing between 3-5 interviews a week when I was job hunting and they were pretty all much well known firms and I was turning down lots of other opportunities. The company I work with now is related to finance and growing rapidly and they also offered me the exact salary I asked for without trying to haggle down which was nice.

I often seen mid-tier to senior dev roles advertised round here in the 5-65k region and some up to 75k. With the right CV and firm you can often push that higher too. I also get a lot of roles offered to me that are fully remote for London firms due to covid but as many companies have been 100% remote for almost a year now I would be surprised if it stays like this in the future.",2021-02-13 19:06:04
blockov12,"Im sorry you had to work on this and my frustration is not directed to you personally. I think this could have been done so much better. Feeling like there is a serious lack of testing before roll out and/or poor leadership/direction

Improving hr and finance at the sacrifice of all end users in all other departments does not seem like a good balance. Implementing a system wide change to a general audience should be 1. Simple and 2. Fool proof (as much as possible) 3. Properly guided. Workday has not been this in the slightest. 

Dumping a steep learning curve to end users is never a good model. Yes were in academia we're all capable but the time we spend could be used on advancing research and projects rather than a practice in redundancy.",2021-02-13 21:18:57

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies.",2021-02-13 22:47:22

Mewseido,"Congratulations on thinking of your future! 


If you don't have a 3 to 6 months emergency fund, use your refund to finance that. 

You could put some of it in a 3 or six-month saving CD if you want to try and get a little bit more interest. 

If you have an adequate emergency fund, strongly consider opening a Roth IRA with Vanguard or Fidelity or Schwab. 

Find out what their minimums are, and stick the money in a boring low cost total stock market index fund. 

You are young enough that even modest amounts thrown into a Roth IRA and let alone to grow and prosper over long periods of time, will let you take advantage of the compound interest curve. 

Your future self will thank you!

Good luck!",2021-02-14 00:15:24

MothMonsterMan300,"If this is about online idk, dont play it much. But I'll still throw in my two cents about the story's guns, having played it a bunch, and bc im bored and cant sleep and I'm a huge gun nerd. 

Revolvers: Schofield wins out but the LeMat gets a nod. The Schofield is the best balance between accuracy and power; the LeMat is way more powerful and has 9 shots but it takes way longer to re-aquire targets and has a learning curve to land hits. It would also only be about 10 years Hosea's junior at the time lol, crazy obsolete by 1899. But its *badass.* 

Pistols: the 1899 is weak but crazy accurate(like CRAZY once you dial it in, headshots at repeater range) the Mauser is powerful and available earlier, and the auto pistol is a balance between the two and shoots incredibly fast. Having used all 3 plus the Volcanic, the Mauser is the only one that holds up long-term bc the other 3 either rip through ammo or need constant maintenance. Mausers also win the cool factor for me. 

Repeaters: obviously the Lancaster is a cowboy classic and the Litchfield is the most powerful, but both reload slow as hell. The Evans is kind of weak but very accurate and holds 26 shots so you never need to reload. The carbine repeater stays surprisingly relevant late in the game bc it reloads *so fast* and handles faster than the other repeaters. Guess I would have to go Litchfield over all but it's only available really late in the game sadly. 

Shotguns: occasionally I'll still use the pump-action when I'm feelin froggy, but tbh I think shotguns are easily the most irrelevant and outclassed guns in the game. Nothing they can do cant be done better at every range by a repeater. They're brutal at point blank obviously but 99% of up-close fights are settled with your handguns or knife before it even occurs to you to pull up the weapon wheel. I even tried to lean on them in one playthrough just for the character and always wound up fighting with the handguns out of range frustration anyway. Special nod to the sawn-off for being able to cut hillbillies in half, though, thing's a riot.

Rifles: if you spend your first $150 on the Springfield and a scope, you will never want for money bc its perfect for hunting all large game. Great way to finance yourself early game. You get the rolling-block for free, but you cant opt to shoot with iron sights the way you can with the Springfield. Both are made TOTALLY obsolete by the bolt-action rifle which is, in my opinion, the best overall gun in the game. Both scoped and with iron sights it's useful as hell against people and animals. 

Special mentions: the bow is really effective and can shoot some crazy arrows but feels sadly underwhelming. With improved arrows its awesome for hunting large amounts of big game without scaring everything away, and you also need small game arrows to complete trapper items/satchel improvements.Throwing knives suck, tomahawks aren't much better but both have novelty. Molotovs are fuckin useless and dynamite is dangerous, but you can get a better feel for both by finding an empty field and feeling out the throwing distances. The lasso is for comedic relief, dragging klansmen through a swamp to be death-rolled by gators never gets old. And by god, you'd better learn how to throw your hands bc a fistfight can go very wrong very fast- which is why I usually just stab the guy. 

Just for fun: I call it ""Arthur Finally Lost It Mode;"" grow a huge beard and wear the tri-corner hat exclusively, assailing whoever deigns to cross Arthur's pirate path with the broken cutlass and twin sawn-offs. Bonus points for chugging Guarma Rum and trying to rob NPC's in canoes on Iron Lake like a Scooby-Doo villain. Alternatively the Viking helmet/axe, bow, and bearskin cloak make depopulating Butcher Creek feel a little more appropriate, but it's not like anyone is taking a census there anyhow.",2021-02-14 15:25:26
skeletal_vagina,"On the flipside, I'm 35 and wasn't ""allowed"" to color my hair until fairly recently. Between having an overbearing mother, working many *many* retail jobs, and then a career in finance, it just wasn't viable.

The learning curve when you're older is much steeper because of societal expectations that we should know how to do it by now.

BowzaMan,"I just switched to ToS (early Jan, 2021), with past experience with E\*Trade, Ally Invest, M1 Finance, Wealthfront, Vanguard and Bank of America.

PROS:

* Highly advanced capabilities, if you want to learn them
* Platform will almost always be able to what you want to do, and more
* One-Cancels-Other functionality (If Order A takes place, then auto-cancel Order B, C, D)
* Scan functions are very powerful
* ToS was not one of the brokerages that took away consumers' right to buy equities of their choice during the GME rally

CONS:

* The platform is often overly complex for no reason; there is a very steep learning curve. I am still learning the ropes after \~6 weeks of frequent use
* The ToS community in this subreddit is often condescending, insulting, and generally unsupportive
* The platform sometimes has blatant blindspots in places where you wouldn't expect (e.g. there is no functionality to add up the total value of all pending orders. If you have a margin-enabled account, this means you can easily slip into margin / high-interest loans without your knowledge or intention).
* ToS likes to brag about the Education site, and how robust the training is. Personally, I've found this section to be lacking.

Overall, I would recommend ToS to anyone who is interested in upping their trading sophistication and placing advanced orders or scans. Inversely, if you're someone who likes ease of use, an intuitive UI, or a platform that makes your life easy, I'd advise you to look elsewhere.",2021-02-15 00:45:52

INTERGALACTIC_CAGR,"I feel like there are quite a few things at play here.   


1. The recession from COVID caused a massive cash out in the market
2. Cathie had amazing ARK returns on all ETFs 
3. Seeing the trend to online and work from home - old money finally caught on to innovation they have been stifling (ignoring and not investing)
4. With markets recovering money that was taken out of old sectors from the panic of the recession, is now going to emerging disruptive technologies and sectors like FinTech - SQ, PYPL, BTC, TSLA being the biggest news that marks a subtle transition to FinTech and BTC being taken seriously. Additionally SQ (\~1B) and Mass Mutual (\~100M) have bought BTC
5. People who are not as in tune with the shift are crying bubble and confused as hell because they are following momentum that they don't understand.
6. The people that are following innovation and actually believe in the companies they invest in like MicroPenis Inc, ain't scared of no bubble - momma didn't raise no paper handed bitch 

It feels like a paradigm shift in the market that many think is a bubble but I believe priorities have changed or at least the money has changed directions towards future innovation, Cathie's future is coming faster thanks to COVID and her outstanding ETFs.

Additionally Cathie had a Yahoo Finance interview where she believes the Bond market is in a bubble because of they way AMC and GME bonds reacted during the Sque-andal. Additionally, in the big ideas 2021 video the break down the S-Curve of the market with transition to new technology.

buddyholly27,"Remember that the word ""finance"" ecompasses a bunch of different careers across different ""settings"" and is not really a meaningful label in and of itself. 

Traditional high finance career paths will have different earning curves to internal corporate function tracks to wealth management tracks to banking / lending tracks to insurance tracks to professional services financial advisory tracks to financial product sales tracks.

And even within each of these, there is variety: The comp structure / curve for IB is different from HF is different from PE within high finance. Working at a startup vs a financial institution vs a large corp vs a mid-market company will all carry different comp structures for corporate roles - then there is the case of whether you scale the exec ladder vs stay stuck at individual contributor / manager. Working in private banking vs a wirehouse vs discount broker will carry different comp curves / structured. Working in corporate banking (CIB) will carry a different comp curve to commercial / mid-market banking. So on and so forth.

It's extremely hard to generalise across ""finance"" without being specific. Kind of wish we introduced flares for these kinds of posts tbh so we know what ""type"" of roles people mean when referring to ""finance"". At the moment it's all a bit of a mess.",2021-02-16 01:00:30
Possible_Debate727,"From a finance major, it was a lot more math intensive with some more theory (and also quite a lot of writing) in fourth year. However, many of the courses were primarily through excel, the learning curve was not per say the actual math, but the depth and understanding of that math, and a larger scope and quantity of topics that were covered. Overall, still a quantitative heavy major.

Can't speak for accounting, but at an intermediate level, strong accounting skills are not really based on math skills, but of strong reading comprehension and being able to communicate that conceptual understanding well. There is also a certain applied logical thinking to Tax and Managerial Accounting that differs slightly to financial accounting, which many people do struggle with. 

It may seem very overwhelming, but you'll start to develop better study skills over time and you would be surprised at how much more you can handle and learn in 3rd and 4th year. 

I am not entirely sure how the process of transferring programs works, but from the experience of some friends, a lot of credits will transfer over. One friend was able to actually graduate in the same year as me even after they transferred over (I do believe they did take quite a bit of school in the summer). It is very doable, and compared to SAF, first year BM courses aren't as difficult/the program isn't as rigidly structured , so you should be able to take on more courses should you want to catch up and graduate in 4 years. If you move from BM to SAF, you will most definitely be at least a year behind because of how the program is structured, and the limited availability of courses each semester.

Again, I wouldn't recommend SAF straight out to say it's a better program. It really depends on where your interests are, and SAF is very focused on exactly it's name, Accounting and Finance. I do think that given your circumstances that you've already been accepted to SAF, I do think it is worth considering just because it'll be a lot harder to change from BM to SAF rather than the other way around.",2021-02-16 01:04:10
RepulsiveNumber,"The left there has been neoliberalized since the early 80s. From Mudge's *Leftism Reinvented*, on the Swedish case:

&gt; In the wake of another oil price shock the SAP won the 1982 election and returned to government in 1983. At this point there could be little doubt as to who won the war of the roses. The crisis program of the MoF rightists became part of the SAP’s 1982 election campaign, “presented as the Social Democrats’ alternative to social dismantling.”

&gt; The new SAP government’s “third way,” or “third path” policy (tredje vägens politik) launched with an unprecedented 16 percent devaluation, a tighter budget “to break inflation and to signal the end of devaluation,” and a host of “supply-side” reforms that included liberalizing finance and tax reform. On the heels of the devaluation Feldt made it clear that “compensatory nominal wage increases would not be corrected by expansionary fiscal measures or by new devaluations.” The introduction of market devices into public services was also important: the Ministry of Finance aggressively advocated “the introduction of various types of … ‘quasi-markets’ in the social services sector,” in which “the provision of services is separated from direct political control, and the role of government is reduced to that of ‘purchasing” services’ from competitive bidders.” Competition was also encouraged via Swedes’ exercise of choice in service provision.

&gt; Notably, the third way SAP government embraced a diluted version of the wage-earner funds and continued to situate full employment as its main objective. Party leadership was also aggressively anti-neoliberal in tone. Erlander’s successor, Olof Palme, declared unemployment a threat to human well-being and democratic stability, aggressively defending the trade union movement and the welfare state. Around 1985 Palme pursued “an enthusiastic campaign against ‘neoliberalism’ ”—a term that referenced the neoconservative, pro–free market right, particularly in Britain and the United States. As the SAP government rolled out third road policies, it still maintained full employment as a central objective. Yet the new government clearly rejected Keynesian means to Swedish social democracy’s ends. Rather, it appeared to move in lockstep with the formation of Swedish-style new classicism in economics.

&gt; By the mid-1980s Söderström sat at the head of both the SNS (CEO, 1985–2002) and the SNS Economic Policy Group (chair, 1984–1994). Thus situated, he made the case for rule-based economic policies—a Swedish version of the kind of anti-discretionary thinking expressed by Milton Friedman—mainstream. In the SNS’s official history, the rationale for the move was the experience of “stagflation”: since “the theory of rational expectations and supply side economics put the focus on the need to create long-term favorable conditions for economic growth through deregulation, comprehensive tax reform, and a monetary policy focused on price stability,” in the 1980s “the [SNS] Economic Council put forward the idea of a norm-based stabilization policy and price stability as the overriding norm for economic policy,” with a target inflation rate of between 2 and 4 percent. Sure enough, in 1985 the SAP government announced that it was ending political discretion in monetary policy and that it would not borrow to finance its debt but would rely instead on foreign holders of Swedish currency. In the account of the Swedish scholar Magnus Ryner, the financial and monetary arm of the SAP-in-government saw the end of monetary political discretion in favor of the discipline of international financial markets as the best means of managing inflation: “The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank reasoned that when unions, social service agencies and individuals took increased interest rate sensitivity into account, their propensity to consume would decline.”

&gt; On March 1, 1986, Palme was assassinated while walking home from the cinema, and was succeeded by Ingvar Carlsson (1934–). Neither SAP rhetoric nor economic policy changed considerably after Palme’s death, but Swedish economic management changed in a decidedly anti-Keynesian way. Inflation returned in the late 1980s, and in 1989 the SAP government abandoned exchange controls. Shortly thereafter Feldt announced, at a conference in Stockholm, that Sweden was opening its doors to foreign banks.

&gt; The effects of Sweden’s financial liberalization are shown in Figures 8.5 and 8.6. As the figures show, the effects of the SAP government’s new financial and monetary policies quickly set in: flows of foreign investment grew markedly in the 1990s and, under Göran Persson (1949–, Swedish PM 1996–2006) in particular, Sweden’s financial balance of payments went sharply positive.

&gt; Later, in 1999, Eklund—by this time a Chief Economist at the SEB—wrote in an “intellectual biography and manifesto” that Swedish “[p]arty politicians and interest organizations” had yet to fully grasp “just how radically Sweden is going to change due to globalization and the open economy.” In a mode that is reminiscent of the anti-discretionary, market-centered arguments of Milton Friedman in his 1960s exchanges with Walter Heller, Eklund called on Swedish political elites to attune themselves to the necessities of markets: the “forces of globalization,” Eklund argued, would have to be embraced if SAP politicians wanted to “advance prosperity.” By this time, Eklund’s words were undoubtedly true—but third road economic policy had played no small part in creating that new reality.

&gt; The question of whether or not the SAP of the mid-to late 1980s was, despite its rhetoric, “neoliberal” is not a very helpful one. Feldt was later adamant that the party’s aim was to avoid neoliberalism, not to embrace it. These self-accounts should be taken at face value. The question, then, is how it was possible for SAP leadership to understand third road policies, no matter how market-friendly, as anti-neoliberal. The analysis thus far suggests that this disconnect was a cross-field effect in which intraparty struggles drove changes in economics, and changes in economics shaped interpretive and programmatic struggles within the SAP.

&gt; Among the consequences, one stands out: the SAP could no longer hold the party-labor relationship together. Initially the SAP’s third road policies had the desired effect in terms of Sweden’s balance of payments, industrial competitiveness and profits, and a balanced budget. Unemployment declined to very low levels by 1989. But in the 1990s, even after the SAP returned to government in 1994, unemployment never returned to the sustained lows of the Keynesian era. Meanwhile, the Swedish economy remained Keynesian, in the Phillips curve sense: from 1970 to 2005 the correlation between inflation and unemployment rates in Sweden remained almost perfectly negative (−0.80). But, as shown in Figure 8.7, the historical prioritization of full employment was abandoned between 1991 and 1992 for the sake of keeping inflation low—ushering in a new era of inverted Keynesianism in Sweden.

&gt; With the return of unemployment came the end of wage solidarity and a considerable weakening of the party-union relationship. Containing wage demands was key to the party’s ability to manage the Swedish economy; to this end, the SAP government depended on the strength of corporatist institutions and the willingness of union leadership to agree to wage constraint. In the 1980s, union leadership was thus in the contradictory position of both representing workers and being a lever for the containment of wage demands, even as third road policies suggested that SAP leadership was no longer committed to facilitating compensatory trade-offs. By increasing private sector profitability at the expense of the public sector and making the labor market a zero-sum game from the perspective of workers, third way policies undermined the basic foundations of Swedish wage coordination. By extension, they destabilized the SAP-union relationship writ large. “The (correct) perception that profits were not channeled into productive investments, but into speculation and expansion abroad,” Ryner comments, “further undermined the legitimacy of government policy in trade unions circles.”

&gt; The effects of the breakdown in the SAP-union relationship, also a basis of the party’s ability to build cross-party coalitions, were manifest by the end of the 1980s. Carlsson offered his resignation after the Riksdag rejected an austerity package: the Swedish Communist Party would not agree to wage and price freezes. An attempted government-imposed freeze on wages, prices, and dividends plus prohibition on strikes produced across-the-board discontent, and the government was forced to step down. As the SAP led an initiative for EU membership, its public opinion ratings dropped below 30 percent—the SAP’s lowest level since the 1920s. The SAP lost the September 1991 elections and, despite a comeback in 1994, would never fully regain its electoral strength. In the end, Ryner argues, third road policies amounted to the self-sabotage of the SAP.

It goes on further, but I'm likely approaching the character limit for comments here. I also can't post the figures being referenced, although I suppose I can at least attest to their existence in the book.",2021-02-16 03:07:58

laura041211,"I worked at agencies with both b2c and B2B clients and now in house doing financial PR work. I have always preferred B2B work because I just find it more complex and interesting since you are communicating to a business audience with a complex understanding of the subject. 

One of the harder things about financial PR is that you might feel like a fraud sometimes since, unless you went to business school (I didn’t) you probably won’t have the sophisticated understanding of your company and the learning curve can be steep. But if you can get a basic understanding, you’ll be able to do your job just fine and will learn over time (and spend a lot of time on Investopedia!).

One thing to watch out for in finance, like the other person said, is an extremely risk averse culture. Finance, law, etc may not be as open to new ideas as some other companies, but there are always exceptions. Ask a lot of questions about how they interact with the media, approve ideas, market themselves, etc.

I would also ask if the role is more product promotion or more thought leadership. The latter will be way more interesting. If it’s the former, only a few select trades will cover your products and probably no one else will care.",2021-02-16 11:12:52

Clear-Fudge,"First let's make a correction not a Mr, but your example proved the point I'm trying to make It is priced too high if only 10% of your fan base is purchasing. As far as your comment about setup to make a 5-minute video, You should be filming multiple videos per setup, You're filming it yourself there's no one else to pay but you're still charging at a professional rate. Scale the length versus cost of your video to that of professional porn videos, your videos are still grossly over the cost of professional production. And I am talking about business, in the laws of business are transferable across numerous platforms, and there are fundamental laws that are being broken. Take McDonald's, No one would call this gourmet food, yet it out sales more upscale restaurants exponentially, why, The dollar menu. They understand that you price something low people buy more. do you know on average people spend more on the dollar menu than they would have spent just buying a regular combo thus the company makes more profit. This is transferable to the only fans platform.

A creator with 100 subs that creates a video like you said for $20 and only 10 people purchase makes $200, that same video price at $5 if all 100 subs by it that same creator would have made $500, But that's in a perfect world, Even if only half the subs, 50, purchase this video you still make more money at $5 then you did at $20. Sales is a game of quantity. most of the females on the only finance platform do not have a brand You cannot charge Gucci prices for a product nobody knows. Further at $20 a sub buys a video, they're not going to turn around and purchase another $20 video the next day but they will at $5 to $10, so you're making more money. We can debate this all day but nothing will ever change these figures.

20 x 10 = 200

10 x 100 = 1000

  5 x 1000 = 5000

Scale that however you want you will always have this truth, the lower the price the more people will purchase.

I'll even go further and tell you eliminate PPV from your page completely none of my pages have it All my content is posted to the wall or sent free through DMs, with the exception of merch bundles, are my pages doing good, you be the judge my house will be paid off this year. One of my pages doesn't even have pictures or videos and I would gamble it still pulling down better numbers. 

And of course you would be against this because if everyone else loves their prices you would be forced to lower yours and you don't want to do that because you think you're going to be losing out. You spoke about the top 10% of creators and I promise you most of those do not have a high subscription cost and they are not charging $20 per video, I've shared the trials with hundreds of creators and seeing their pages in the way they move their content and though I don't agree with all of their practices they're still coming in below this $20 curve, because they understand that sales is a quantity game. 

The one thing we can agree on is how much time is spent on promotion and marketing, I don't know about 17 hours of screen time, but you will spend a lot of time doing promotional posting. This is not a constant because once you reach a certain level you spend less time having to continue promoting so much. It never ends I'm not saying that you always have to do promotion, but once you have a following big enough your brand takes on the life of its own subs will find you. I never one time imply that this is fast or easy money this is work like any other business. 

At the end of the day creators it's your page run it the way you want to and don't take my word for it do your own research, but I stand strong on my words that you will not make more because your prices are higher.",2021-02-18 02:51:27
kurupt311,"Yeah I think it’s TBD on whether it goes full on crypto apocalypse again; but, my concern is still large scale, established, reputable corporations adopting the technology since that is a huge driver of investment capital and use case proof.  Most large companies (except a few more “tech liberal” ones like Tesla as an example) are pushing back on crypto / block chain still and I see that having a few core reasons:
1. They are working through the standard change curve and are resisting something new 
2. The block chain tech (even when untethered to crypto as a fiat alternative) still gets lumped in together with prior BTC bull runs in people’s minds
3. Some people and groups in the past have heavily abused ICOs as a profit generation tool with no real business plans or ability to deliver resulting in less faith in alt / startup projects 

I don’t think these will individually cause another crash but collectively / all 3 and coupled with investors pulling massive gains from BTC and yeah I’ll be scared lol.  If this happens and we see anything like a few years ago, I would honestly be long-term INSANELY pumped for what I am seeing as “crypto’s mainstream adoption” which I still think is 3-5 years out.  By this I mean DeFi being common place; Fortune 500 adoption of block chain tech (and having block chain dev lines stood up) being a regular occurrence; etc.  Until more people in IT leadership roles at large companies get educated about these things and until there is enough of a sentiment shift towards acceptance and education, I still think we have a ways to go.  As it stands, I don’t see a lot of indication of what I would want to see to drive long-term and sustained success this iteration.  Again, hopefully I’m wrong lol.  If I am then this could be that final crypto bull run; but my gut tells me it needs one last push (some massive snowball of news in the space to generate so much forward momentum that it’s unstoppable - I.e. a major, heavily regulated financial institution adopting and implementing use of crypto and crypto use cases in multiple ways and choosing to somehow work both within centralized finance and DeFi simultaneously).  A company I am watching right now is MassMutual.  If they do more beyond their initial $100mm investment, that would be a tremendously strong sign to me ($100mm is nothing for them and it’s legit like them tossing a penny into a wishing well so even though it seems huge it’s a joke investment / a publicity stunt at best).  If MM or a company or a number of companies like that go balls deep then I think BTC will be sitting at insanely high levels (literally the store of electronic value for everyone, not just for us that use or invest currently) and projects like The Graph will become the next true gold rush and we will be on the ground floor of that.  A lot to unpack here but just a mind dump from me lol.",2021-02-18 19:44:47
NPRjunkieDC,"https://ragingbull.com/kb/how-to-make-money-with-penny-stocks/

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies. 

If you are using RH or WB that don't allow pennystocks there is a subreddit r/RobinHoodPennyStocks .
On NASDAQ many options like CTRM + SNDL + DGLY + HIMX + CIDM + NOK + ATOM+ ENG

upper_west_sider,"What do you mean where? It's just what's happening. Look at 10y and 30y yields (and 5 and 7 year). The 10y is up above 1.3% today, 40bps higher YTD. The 30y is 45bps higher. Obviously when the additional fiscal spending passes the treasury has to issue new debt to finance the spending, so that floods the market with treasuries and yields rise because nobody really wants them in the private sector with negative real yields across the curve. That's being priced in right now. The Fed can print money to purchase a ton of these and keep yields suppressed, which is what they've been doing and did in overdrive in March and April, however that just directly injects new printed money into the consumer economy which is hugely inflationary. They'll ultimately choose that route, though, because the alternative is letting stocks crash which would put GDP back on a negative trajectory and spiral the economy again. Many corporates go bankrupt, US starts having a hard time servicing interest at the high yields, etc. This reflation trade is close to consensus net long at this point among professional investors because everyone knows the Fed will not step in to tighten in the face of rising inflation due to these dynamics. Today is a prime example with stocks dumping due to yields rising, it's just starting to happen at an even lower yield level than I thought.",2021-02-18 23:46:25

DevsMustDie,"Sorry, I'm seeing your reply only today!  


As to why the game didn't do well, I think there are several things that come into play.

  
First I don't think our publisher did enough to promote the game especially outside of Europe. When we signed with them and talked about events, I knew we would go to Gamescom, but we only went in the business area and their PR partner didn't manage to book that many meetings with journalists. I was expecting them to get a booth at a PAX or another event in the US, but they never did which I found disappointing.  They also started to talk about the game way too close to the release date I think and couldn't get any help from Nintendo even if we had a simultaneous release on Steam and Switch and had developed specific features for the console version.


All in all, I don't think the PR agency they hired for the job was very good. When we got copies of the press release they send, they were like all text, at first there wasn't even a link to the presskit!! We got them quite late every time, so it was difficult to ask for changes when we saw them first.

The release date was horrible, right between RDR2 and Death Stranding (which probably explain part of the lack of press attention) but they wouldn't change it because they needed the game to release in 2019 (I guess because of their financing calendar, higher ups wouldn't accept that money spent in 2019 would start paying back in 2020 or smth like that).

We didn't get any success with the bottlespark campaign they ran and so several thousands euros where spend to reach influencers and streamers and we saw very few returns. Like less than 10 live streams and the most successful one only had about 100 average viewers for 2 hours. Definitely a bad investment, I think that also linked to the lack of previous hype.

But we also made mistakes on our side for sure! The game is too difficult, especially since it plays differently than your classic 2D platformer, so the learning curve is too steep for most people. I think this didn't help with streamers and general word of mouth if people dropped the game early because they felt they were bad at it while they didn't want to invest the time to actually get better - which I can understand. 

This makes me think that we might have missed the spot when communicating about the game, but I still think that using the ""do you have what it takes to beat that game?"" marketing strategy is way harder for indies than for an AAA prod like Dark Souls.

We also playtested the full game too late in development and with players that were ""too close to our target audience"", meaning that they enjoyed the difficulty and having to learn how to play. If we had anticipated that earlier, we might have had some time to adjust that or implement a few level design tricks to make players feel better about their performance in the game.


What I'm most disappointed about is that we launched a demo about a month before launch and had a ""crowd scoring contest"" with it. We added the scores of every entry on the 1st level leaderboard, and when that total exceeded a certain amount, we gave a better launch discount to everyone. We had goals to increase the discount from 10 to 20% I think, then added the soundtrack for free as a bonus and had one last bonus that wasn't reached. To our knowledge, this was the first time anything like that had been tried (though other games did ARG or contests, I don't think they linked any of that to an actual launch discount) but we didn't get any press cover and we got about 1000 participants, for an actual 100 sales on the release day...

So in the end, we're still proud of our game, especially considering that we brought what was a graduation project to an actual game on PC and console, founding a studio in the process, we learned a lot and I have to say that even after playing the game many hours during development, I still enjoyed playing it and getting all achievements on Steam when I had the courage to play it again 2 months after the release haha! But on the business side of things, it's a bust. We're never going to recoup and the cash we had left after the release is not enough to finance a new prototype, so every one got a new job of their own. Now we have a company that has a few thousand euros sitting by (thanks to the grant we got that gave part of the money after the release...) but even if we gave it back to the friends and family that invested money in our company, they would get about a 10th of what they gave us.

skecr8r,"Thing is, what you need to show currently is exceptional skill in

- ML
- Maths
- Stats/Probability
- Coding
- Possibly finance, depends on the place.

At least to land a job in a top HF/Prop shop. Crack and Joshi won't give you a lot of that. You should know the basic quant finance questions, but what I think you also need is

- Understanding every algorithm and method in Elements of Statistical Learning II
- Having a solid knowledge of cutting-edge NLP techniques, transformers, BERT, etc. 
- Properly understand your language, whatever it is. Nothing worse than some player talking big about C++ and who then fails to write a basic class by hand, or a Python programmer who doesn't know what a decorator does
- Being able to solve moderate questions about any algorithm or method of analysis covered in the first 400-500 or so pages of Cormen
- Use the newer books to stay on curve; Crack is fucking 19th edition man. Look on crossvalidated and math for interview questions, and the newer books and some of the harder classics - 150 Most Frequently Asked Questions, Mosteller's 50 problems in probability

snapple1122,"Bought a navara np300 last year taking advantage of instant asset tax write off, after I sold my bomb, the difference after tax was only $5k for a car with less than 40,000 kms and 15 years newer.

Remember as a Tradie your car pulling into the driveway can be your first impression, you don’t want to come across as untrustworthy, and while most people on this sub get around in cheap cars, if it helps you get work it’s worth the investment. Also if you can avoid trailers as a Tradie it saves a massive headache. 

You can get a decent VE Ute for $10-15k, or the trusty econovan, otherwise if you need 4x4 the tritons are great value for money as well. There’s a lot of cheap finance at the moment with interest rates &lt;5% for vehicles. Always found the sweet spot for buying second hand is cars with just over 100,000kms and 3-5 years old, then drive them for 3-5 years and sell just before 200,000km, in that range the depreciation curve is pretty flat and the maintenance in minimal.

Music-Entire,"Im not here to mislead people. Im here to inform on a highly probable scenario. Its pretty clear finance is going to the blockchain; reading about the great reset and cbdc’s is enough to end such speculation and take it as fact. Another fact is that ISO20022 is being launched in Nov 2021 on a global network and will be the new SWIFT standard. ISO20022 needs oracles in order to function across thousands of different centralized ledgers; banks, financial markets, telecom etc. We also know that software company Oracle is involved, a long term partner of LINK - however they do not offer oracles, how funny that may sound according to their business name. So, who in this whole world would be better or more likely to provide the oracle / smart contract infrastructure for ISO20022 over Chainlink? Please tell me...
Furthermore, we are investors, we need to be ahead of the curve, therefore we need to speculate and extrapolate future scenarios in order to make the right investment decisions. For example: you would have wanted to buy Apple shares before they launched the iPhone. There was speculation about them launching a smartphone and investors who took the risk got rewarded. In the end is about the likelyhood of certain speculation to be true; in this case I have not seen a single crypto project getting close to be able to handle oracles for ISO20022 other than Link. So speculation? Maybe. Likehood of this being tue? A lot, imo. Just look at the LINK blog and what they write specifically about ISO20022 and the financial markets as a whole. I dont see it being too speculative, rather a very very big investment opportunity — and yes, those always come with a risk factor. Trade at your own risk and dyor.

randomlygeneratedID,"As a father of two sons 19 and 16 (one doing a music composition for games and movies, the other wanting to go into acting) I think it is important to let your children pursue THEIR dreams. Although we have convinced our younger son to also do Comp Sci at A-level so that he has something to support a backup plan.  I was going to study law until I found a passion for creative pursuits, I went to a “public school”(private school for non brits) here in the UK so had many educational opportunities at my fingertips. Instead I have a BA in animation and interactive art. I have been in games/entertainment media in one way or another since 1997, programming in everything from Metropolis to Lingo to C# along the way. I do firmly have a foot in both sides (the “creative design” side as well as the “development” side) so I am by no means an expert coder.

Happy to chat via pm if I can help in any way. Would like to know where you are in the UK to see if there is opportunity to potentially hook you up with someone who runs a game studio. (others reading this please don’t bombard my inbox)
Although obviously things aren’t normal at the moment so they aren’t in the their offices as usual. Both of my sons did their GCSE work placements there.

I also passed this thread on to someone at intogames. It is a charitable organisation focused on mentorship and similar activities to help foster young people getting into the games industry (especially from under-represented backgrounds).

There is of course plenty of competition and comp sci in the finance industry probably has a much higher pay ceiling, but at the end of the day money is used for enjoyment as well as survival, so there is a balance to find between how much enjoyment you get out of earning that money in the first place. We have compSci/higher math grads that could be in the finance industry, but are much happier in this industry, even with lower pay.

You can also look into non gaming industries that seek out game industry folk. I have been approached by startups &amp; established businesses on other markets(medical,education,travel) that want to introduce game psychology/gaming elements into their user experiences.

You should also consider getting ahead of the curve (mastering Unity ECS &amp; DOT) this will really put you in a strong position down the line and make it much easier to secure employment. HTML5 /Javascript is now dominant is delivery of our games. A few years ago it was AS &amp; Flash. Educate yourself for the future, when you will to make a living from what you have learned.

urethrapaprecut,"I know I say this every time but it's never not true. Feel the grief, experience the pain, start working towards a solution. The only thing we do by relenting to utter despair is ensure it will not change. Things will happen slowly and you will almost certainly never see the fruits of your labor but it's like global warming, it's about something bigger than us.

This current configuration of society has done us some good, Corporations and ingenuity have created this lavish and comfortable life that many of us get to experience (compared to fending for ones self in the forest). However, it is very important to note that lavish and comfortable experiences are not necessarily meaningful ones. This is a selfish society but only because the people at the top are selfish. I think, I know we can do better. But every good piece of progress that society has reaped has been fought for, tooth and nail. Just because our grocery stores are usually full and our heat works most of the time doesn't make people happy, and it doesn't mean the work is done. We can see there are many facets of society where great effort is being expended to improve, sexual liberty, racial liberty, but work and income is losing ground. We have to fight for it, or it will only get worse.

What we can do: Vote for people who are willing to change the system. I know it feels like voting doesn't do anything, and it's true that it doesn't do _much_ but that's only because complacency has filled our political systems with grifters and the money-hungry and those people have set up a system to help themselves maintain power. The people we elect today have the power to change the rules forever. I believe that though we don't see much currently, if we really continue to expend true effort and heart, we're at the start of an exponential curve. Once the rules start to change it becomes much harder for the assholes to maintain their power and easier for good to win, it compounds.

What rules? 
1. In america the two party system is a natural consequence of our first-past-the-post voting system. We can transition to ranked choice to allow more diverse opinions and break 2 party stalemates. 
2. Proportional representation to truly represent the views of the constituents and not just which party has slightly more people than the others. Campaign finance reform, self explanatory. 
3. Better economic prospects and national safety nets that will afford people to stop worrying about food and health and start to participate in and change a political system that has fucked them for generations.
4. Getting the word out. There are things we can do and I believe spreading despair only makes it harder for people to do the necessary work to fix this.
5. Many, many more things I cannot remember right now. The ideas exist, we just need to get them to the right people and get those people to the right place.

ryebit,"Ethereum (and most blockchains) all use very standard cryptographic primitives. SHA2 / SHA3 for hashing, ECC (elliptic curve cryptography) for asymetric encryption.

Know what else uses those primitives? *EVERYTHING*. SSH tunnels, VPN traffic, HTTP over TLS/SSL, version control software, x509 certificates, pretty much all government communications, you name it.

If a quantum computer rolls out that can crack those primitives, Ethereum failing will be one tiny ember on the burning log that is the finance industry, all within a huge raging forest fire that is pretty much all of the public internet.

And anyone who can crack those protocols isn't going to start somewhere that will leave a visible public trail, like a blockchain -- they'll start stealing passwords from the CIO of Mastercard, untraceably rewrite ownership records for some Amazon shares. Or, since it'll probably be a nation-state, they'll go after military secrets first.

Even if SHA3 or ECC is cracked, and crypto is 10x it's current size, I think there will still be much more viable targets. Because the last thing you'll want to do is something that makes people aware you can break those algorithms.",2021-02-21 23:09:07

PlayingTheWrongGame,"&gt; With a 50/50 senate and a narrow lead in the house, how CAN he pursue “substantial change?”

* Allow the Federal Employee Pay Comparability Act to fully go into effect. It's been blocked by every President since Bush I, but all he has to do is *not* block it from going into effect to solve a lot of the issues the federal government has hiring and retaining good people.

* Shift work out of the hands of contractors back into the federal government. This would reduce costs (freeing up funds for other efforts: see point 3), improve job performance and outcomes, and also strip funding away from the money laundering scheme that helps finance our dysfunctional politics.

* Wield the tools that Republicans setup for Trump to take more executive power. Ex. declaring climate change a national emergency and using it to reprogram DOD and DOT money to address climate change mitigation, and to order the EPA and such to enforce existing laws more heavily.

* Order the new AG to split his time between cracking down on violent extremism *and following the money* that flows between violent extremist groups, the non-profit political groups that launder the money, and the politicians who are also on the payroll. This would probably catch quite a few conservative Senators in the net, creating opportunities to replace them.

* Order the DOJ to *also* step up enforcement of voting rights protections that are already on the books. Pick some agency within the federal government to quantify the impact of gerrymandering and to objectively determine whether it has discriminatory impact against racial minorities in violation of the voting rights act.

* Aggressively going after the foreign inflows of money and misinformation coming from bad actors of the world stage. There are many, not just Russia.

* Whenever conservatives start making a big public stink about media bias, start publicly endorsing a return of the fairness doctrine to deal with media bias. Get Democrats in Congress to put forward some legislation to reestablish it.

* Use the bully pulpit to push for the changes the progressive wing wants. Be ahead of the curve on messaging, not just waiting until the mass of Democrats have been pulled along already.

* Use the FTC to go after businesses that are plainly abusing their customers with ruinous fees. Ex. the payday loan industry.

* Start blocking mega-mergers and other accumulations of capital in the hands of a few. Force the breakup of big tech companies via anti-trust laws.

othello16,"BOA is an option, it really depends on your goals. Ask your delf these 4 questions and you'll be able to settle on a few options that are best for you.

1. How much money do you have
2. How much money are your trying to make
3. How much are you willing to lose
4. How long are you willing to wait?

Each question feeds into the other. I.e. 

1. I have $1000.00
2. I want to make $100 (some I'm looking for something that moves about 10% - 15%
3. I'm willing to lose half (nut moves less than 50% - 60%
4. Within a week (so the day to day variation on a daily chart is greater then ~ 2.5% but less than 10%  ) 

Now you start:
1.  Look at some charts &amp; perform a little technical analysis
2. Check the Git repository, or news, social media sites etc. to determine if there is a bullish or bearish sentiment.
3. Now that you performed some due diligence, place your order and set a  stop lose. 

As for passive,

All of the above steps, except there is no stop loss. Check out Sushi swap, curve, BAO finance, Uniswap and find consider providing to a liquidity pool that comes closest to addressing those first 4 questions you asked yourself. It help give a reality check so your not aiming to high or low. You'll also know when to pull out ( which is always the hardest part)

npno,"&gt;So i did the math and i asked them so you guys are just going to give me what i owe you guys basically what about the 12k i paid into the car? He responded, but he didnt really answer my question but i get it. Cars are a depreciating asset. 

This is true, cars are a depreciating asset. In practice, lending institutions willstructure a car loan so that follows the projected depreciation curve as close as possible, so it not out of the ordinary to owe pretty close to the market value of your car if you were to sell it today.

&gt;I told him i looked on his website and the cars are going for 16k. I understand you guys gotta make profit but id like a bit more for the car.

You're going to be hard pressed to get more than what he offered you if he's selling similar cars for only ~$2k more. The spread on used cars is typically a bit more than that, but used car value has shot up a bit because of COVID so I guess that's a normal spread now.

&gt;The most he did for me was he offered me 2020 demo car with 9000km on it with a free 5 year warranty. Id lease it for $110 bi weekly for 5 years or finance it for 128$ bi weekly. I told him i really wasn’t interested in a demo because i know how people drive demo cars. He told me he doesnt give these deals out to people often and i would be paying .49 interest.

All this info is basically irrelevant without stating the actual cost of the car, not the monthly payment.

&gt;Then i called my insurance and they told me instead of paying 165 a month id be paying 324 a month. Which is crazy to me because the new car has more safety features.

They also cost a lot more to repair, hence the higher cost to insure.",2021-02-23 02:57:31

dudelydudeson,"Ok, I think I see what you're getting at. Forgive me, newish. Basically, you're planning to get paid to own a free put at a fairly OTM strike for just earnings week. Let's do some napkin math and calculate that IV in the earnings week (5th week) would have to be 4\*(long-short)+short = 240%. You're saying that up to 240% IV is already priced in for that week. If GME shits and IV spikes above that, you're in gravy town and you got paid to make all those gains. Just as long as it doesn't fall off a cliff before earnings week.

However, I personally don't feel confident enough in this kind of vol arbitrage. Isn't the point that everyone knows BS is a bad model and the market makers apply all kinds of correction algos to the market prices, which is why IV% doesn't follow BS anymore? Not sure, I'm a novice in mathematical finance. 

I think you're flipping a coin with ""I think it's going to tank after earnings but not before"" more than you think you are, but, what the hell do I know. My best guess is you collect the premium and the long put goes out worthless. Still theta, still money. Just low return on risk.

Also, trade seems positioned right. It's basically everything neutral except theta - perfect. Shit is gonna go bananas if it tanks anyways, we can throw the models out the window.

The setup worked with GME but maybe there's other tickers out there?

Sounds like you're conservative on your risk management - me too. It's hard to let a trade go late day like that since it's likely not going to be there the next morning, smart to downsize. Often times I open half the position then see how the market gets on, try to see if I can reopen the other half at the same or better pricing. If I see the trade price hitting resistance I'll open the other half. Kind of trading the intra-day momentum to get the best price. I would guess this is an activity that is well on the wrong side of the effort/return curve but whatever, still learning and not a lot of positions to manage.

Babajide94,"Disclaimer: I’m your total average joe who don’t know more about economics and the securities market than what I read online.

I’d say it depends on how heavily invested you are and what your investment horizon is. If your long on a company you truly believe that poses great results (Ex: Tesla) I’d sit back and relax for now and not worry myself. 

I have a few long positions, but I’m mostly in short positions and attempt to follow the market as there’s so much money to be made. This isn’t a good time to fall in love with a single stock. Especially not fairly new start ups in the Cannabis, biopharma, blockchain tech and etc. Take good gains and move on.

With the recent trading days (last week and today), my new game plan this week is to 
review my portfolio positions, double down on high conviction positions and sell low conviction ones. Establish a new position in short 3x leveraged inverse etf (nasdaq &amp; s&amp;p 500) in case these red days keep going. Function as a “cushion” to hedge any upcoming &amp; ongoing bear runs. These inverse etfs are at all time lows, personally feel like you can’t lose getting into it. If you 3x, your portfolio have a good chance of surviving a market “correction”. Also, it seems like a good time to invest in commodities, silver and gold. At some point the curve will shift from the “yet to happen” market to the commodity market. Especially when thing start going south. SIL, SILJ, GDX and GDXJ strong for the future. 

If you read further it’s just me rambling my thoughts. 

There seems to be a new “life changing stock” on reddit everyday, and also a industry changing “SPAC merger” on the news every single week. I don’t live under a rock, and I’m aware the industry is changing in several areas, which Cathy Woods explains excellently. Just an example of what I’m wary of; with all the new EV companies competing against each other right now, only a few will be successful household names in the end. 

Some of us have been very fortunate and made 30..50...80.. even +100% gains on our portfolios. I’ll be honest. I just started trading back in March and I was up 157% come Wednesday last week, before these red days. I’m still over 100%, but I’m no fool. I’m no expert on economics, finance nor the securities market, I know my gains have been boosted by low interest rates, massive injections in form of government aid relief packages, and weekly positive news that sends us retail investors flocking to a new stock. 

With money flowing that freely, if I was a company I’d want a piece of that as well, market the crap out of ourselves and flood the internet with news of new events. In the end it’s our product that decides how successful we are, not our marketing efforts alone. 

I hope everyone has made money during this insane bull run. Might not see another one in our lifetime, so take your gains when it makes sense and be careful!",2021-02-23 13:56:39

Felix_Dzerjinsky,"&gt;  For me it looks very promising that big players in the mining indutry (which I would assume have in depth knowledge about the field) actually invest into Goldspot. It's one thing to convince clients to use your technology, but a whole other to get insiders to invest into your company. 

You're right, its different. Thats why I say to take the rest into attention. Quality service, solid finance etc are as good or better than high tech. You don't need to be the company with the absolutely disruptive tech to make good money.  


&gt; I would imagine using Machine Learning and AI in mining is very promising as the cost savings would be huge. However I have no idea if there other products or services that offer such value in the mining industry. 

This is extremely promising, and an area that will see big movement this decade, but also conventional techniques are still underused. Also mine connection, internet of things sensors, automatization, etc. Search for smart mining if you want to find out more.

rwx-rwx-rwx,How steep of a curve is it to learn what it takes to file your own as a small business (as a finance trader or ebay/amazon seller or a web devloper contractor)?,2021-02-24 03:55:40
magneticmicrowave,"Yes and no, there's so many types of corporate credit it's tough to say how any of it is handled. For SMEs (Small Medium Enterprise) most transactions will be handled out of a revolver which is a fancy bank account  for businesses that lets you run a negative balance up to some predetermined limit, but it can easily be millions or even billions for very large enterprise customers. You pay a small percentage of the available funds so you might pay 25-50k a year to have a 10 million revolver. When you go negative the interest rate on the negative dollars increases to your market rate. 

For long term debt the loans are secured against the value of the company, they act a bit more like a mortgage because you'll get a loan on 5-year terms but the payment plan rarely will have you paying back the full amount during the first term. The bank can usually choose to call the full amount at any time and there are all sorts of agreements and metrics between the bank and the business that are tracked monthly or quarterly. Depending on the size of the company you might have a finance department that spends 4-8 weeks a year preparing stuff so the bank knows you'll still be able to pay a year from now. 

If I have an EBITDA (a relatively useless metric for comparing the size of business' across industries invented by investment bankers in the 80's to essentially justify ever higher valuations) of 4 million and want a 12 million dollar loan you have a ratio of 3.0:1. 

1. You need to convince the bank you're a good investment, with a plan for how that 12 million is going to help turn you into a 6million EBITSA company at the end of 6 years. 
2. Bank says sure, but you owe us 6% interest 3.0+, 4.5% 2.0-2.99, 3.5% for 1.0-1.99, and 2.5% for below 1.0.
3. Bank says because you are using this money to grow the business we're going to adjust the amortization schedule and you need to pay back 6 million in 6 years and  you'll still owe us 6 million at the end of the term. 
4. To help you out more, because you're using this to invest in the business we will adjust it further so you'll owe interest +250k in principal repayment the first year, interest +750k in principal the second, 1 million in principle in year 3&amp;4 and 1.5 million in 5&amp;6. (Actually just a good way of making sure companies aren't in a huge rush to pay the debt down fully and maximizes the interest, the bank only makes money when it has loans out)  

In the end the plan is to have an EBITDA of 6million and debt of 6 million after 6 years. 

666 baby! Ratio of 1.0, very healthy. If it works out the bank says ""Hey!, any plans for how you'll make it to 9 million in the next 6 years? We can give you another 12 million for those plans and role the whole thing into a new loan package based on the new value of the company."" 

That's generally when smaller companies get into trouble because the growth curve always slows down. If you've enjoyed 50% growth over 6 years it will likely be harder to maintain that rate. Throw a recession in there during the second term and our once healthy company is in serious financial trouble. The bank always just assumes you'll grow, if you don't they make it your problem. Until you get big enough then it does become the banks problem. 

These finance guys all operate in such a vacuum it would be hilarious if it wasn't so damaging to the economy. Some of the valuations I've had come across my desk over the years are ludicrous from VCs and PE companies. EBITDA is so easy to manipulate that if you're planning to sell a company you can depress it for a year or two and then 'grow it' for 2-3 years and then sell to someone else for a massive profit because it's growing so quickly. 

Private Equity is basically what you're planning on doing with Credit Cards but with companies. 

1. I get a few rich people to give me money
2. I find a few companies for sale I think I can work with, usually in the same industry
3. I use my investor's money to buy 10-40% of the business with our 'investment' and then I get a bank to cover the rest. 
4. I then transfer that debt onto the company balance sheet, start merging my unrelated companies. 
5. Conduct reorganization, generally change accounting methods to start making things look a little better. 
6. 3-4 through accounting and hopefully actual efficiency gains I am now growing quickly
7. Year 5-6 sell. I've rarely paid off more than a fraction of the bank debt at this point, best part is whoever buys it from me is just going to do the same thing. 

Every time the company 'moves up' and changes hands the debt load just increases. Eventually reality catches up and there is no 'big jump' with someone who buys it, efficiencies have been found, accounting tricks have been played and growth of debt has outpaced the company. The debt the company holds is more than it can afford to pay, because they paid what the company WOULD be worth in investment banker fantasy land. 

But big PE companies are doing this with 10-100 companies at a time. If one of them fails who cares? Some of your other bets will more than cover your losses. Don't forget I'm actually only putting 10-40% of the 'price' of the company down from my investors. That's all I need to 'cover' out of the profits from my other investments. They put in so little of their own capital that massive returns are possible so a few failing doesn't bother anyone at home office.

So you try to grow your way out of it, because that's what PE does, maybe it works, likely you overstretch yourself and the company gets liquidated. PE group doesn't care there's no real cost to them other than a little less profit from somewhere else. The PE company itself has likely been charging outrageous management fees for a while anyways.

In case you're wondering I sometimes work with PE and it is a toxic cancerous industry that doesn't care who is left holding the bag as long as it isn't them. If you don't have skin in the game you shouldn't be allowed to play. I've seen good healthy companies that started with private owners go through the PE thing and it gets nasty. A lot of the time the previous owners were sold a bill of goods, often taking minority ownership stakes that leave them completely powerless, or agreements that dilute their stake down to nothing because the financial targets the PE company told them were going to happen didn't materialize.

dmoccia,"Thank you for posting this comment, it really resonates with me.  I have been using the last couple of months to educate myself more on the crypto ecosystem and determine how different coins fit together/complement each other and what projects can actually deliver value.  I come at this from a data science/developer perspective (drug discovery not finance) so it has been a steep learning curve understanding the lingo and concepts.  

u/Weaver96 gives great examples of why there is room for competition and innovation.  I do not see any reason why there would not be multiple ecosystems consisting of a central blockchain with smart contracts (like ETH), ways to extend those contracts (LINK) and query them (GRT).  There are many uses for this sort of infrastructure (and others) and I do not think specific industries will simply adopt the gold standard.  Instead they will look to experts in their field which have integrated the technology and speak their language whether it is finance, insurance, medicine, transportation, shipping, etc.  Undoubtably there will be projects that fail as there are companies that fail.  In fact I am confident saying that some well thought out projects will fail simply because the team does not know how to get to the right market or does not know the right people.  

If you like ""your coin"" more than others I would encourage you to listen to what others are saying about ""their coin"" as you may learn something.  There are simply too many projects to research and understand so I think it is important to have an open mind.",2021-02-25 22:50:36

But there is no way they could have predicted the future of how proof of work would turn out. Now they are a bit behind the curve of research and progression and it isn't even their fault. It's just a reality.

Loopring and raiden are compelling. I've been following both. I just don't think they solve the real issue of scalability to the point of a global system. I think to do that we need to start with a FAR more powerful base layer and infrastructure. I don't think that layer is eth. At least at the moment, and that's a personal opinion. 

Also, i'm not attacking anyone here. I will admit my discovery of the recovery key situation made me mad and I acted on anger towards the brave team, but at this point, you're just attacking me for having an opinion. To me, layer 2 on eth is a band-aid (albeit a pretty powerful patch job) for a broader problem. It will do wonders for the short term and maybe carry eth just far enough so people don't jump ship before eth 2.0. 

As I already stated, I think the broader goal should be decentralized systems for as many verticals as we (humanity) can apply them to within reason (i.e. finance, law, voting, identity, and so on). I think we should strive to get there as quickly as possible with the best tech possible.

MentalValueFund,"&gt; Can you explain a bit more about why this is the case? I'm having trouble connecting the dots and walking through the logic. 

So lets look at this conversation as a overly simplistic formula for . PV is present value (today's dollars). FV is future value (whatever the future cash flow is). d is your discount rate. And n is the amount of years in the future that cash flow happens at.

    PV = FV / (1 + d)^n 

So the reason treasury rates are important is because how you derive ""d"". I don't want to get into too big of a tangent because there's a lot more to it than this but, in a nutshell ""d"" is the weighted average between a company's ""cost of debt"" and ""cost of equity"". Ignoring debt (though it's affected too), the cost of equity formula is basically =

    Risk free rate + (risk premium)*levered beta

Risk premium is just a spread that investors expect the general equities market to perform over the risk free rate and levered beta can be thought of as correlation between the stock you're valuing and the broad market.

This formula is called the CAPM formula (capital asset pricing model) and basically the gold standard in finance for cost of equity. [Here's a good link that talks about rfr's relationship with cost of equity.](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/risk-free-rate/)

So now to recap, as treasuries rise (the risk free interest rate) so does the discount rate which investors are valuing future cash flows (""d"" in the first formula). As you increase the denominator in the very first formula, the PV number is going to shrink.

&gt; Also, what is the relationship between the treasury rate and the fed prime interest rate? I know the fed can change the prime rate whenever they want (and right now it's close to 0%). Are the fed also change the 10-year treasury rates whenever they want, or is the 10-year treasury rate dictated by market mechanics? 

Great question. So the Fed doesn't actually set the ""prime rate"", you might be confusing that with something else.  The only interest rate they actually have authority to set is called the Overnight Bank Funding Rate or more simply, ""overnight rate"". In a nutshell, primary banks in the country are required to keep a certain amount of reserves in their account with the Fed. If you have excess reserves, they can be lent out on an unsecured basis to other primary financial institutions for an overnight period. Banks use this for too many things to start getting into but the important thing here is to think of this as the most risk free possible rate any entity could have for borrowing a dollar over night.

The reason this is the only direct interest rate the fed sets is because it is the end of the rope that has a domino effect on everything after it. The term ""yield curve"" refers to a basic graph where you form a curve between all the individual ""risk free"" interest rates starting with the overnight rate and going all the way out to the 30 year treasury rate.

There's a whole conversation here on what curve bootstrapping is but that's not worth getting into. The basic answer to your question about 10 year yields is that is the treasury yield determined by the secondary market traders who buy and sell treasury notes/bills/bonds. More people buying means the yield decreases. More people selling means the yield increases.

The reason behind why they buy and sell is a multitude but at the very least is influenced by their expectations on inflation and as a result of increased expected inflation, they expect the Fed to raise the overnight rate. Or if they expect deflation/lower inflation than previously expected, they may buy treasuries and expect the overnight rate to not rise as much (or possibly decrease).",2021-02-26 08:35:39

Faithless_Edward,"&gt;I'm pretty sure you're well-read enough to know the research that shows that immigrants disproportionately contribute to economic growth.

It is true, however one must realize that immigrants are humans and humans are limited beings, both in their productivity of the capital produced, and their variables. If we spend the same amount of money (around $50 Billion every year) on automating the industries that we do on Illegal Immigration, we would become the largest manufacturer of the world, creating huge budget surplus, because unlike humans, machines are not constrained to society or limited in their productivity to produce capital. They don't need wages, they work as long as you power them.
https://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/the-fiscal-cost-unlawful-immigrants-and-amnesty-the-us-taxpayer (The sources lean conservative ideologically)

&gt;Immigrants don't just generate labor, they also generate demand, and they are better entrepreneurs than seventh- generation Americans. 

Sure, but the United States already has enough demand to fuel its economy for the next century to come. Immigrants in average have a less purchasing power than their native counterparts. Entrepreneurship doesn't mean anything, capital generation does. Startups have a failure rate of nearly 90% https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp

&gt;If you change the wage curve for a lot of immigrant- dominated jobs, you're also going to change expenses, which will hit prices, which will hit demand. This stuff doesn't happen in a vacuum. Think about the debate over raising the minimum wage-- the focus is always on how raising wages kills jobs.

No its not the same. Raising minimum wage raises the purchasing power (if the currency is stable and not in hyperinflation or deflation) while raising the number of immigrants raises the labor supply. Higher labor supply than what the market requires causes unemployment, which is a section of population with very low purchasing power. This doesn't translate into an increase in demand, since a section with low purchasing power will always have a lower consumption rate. If your theory held true, then an Increase in the United States population should have saw an increase in wages and capital generation, but the only thing growing is our economy. Last year we jit the highest deficit to GDP ratio in our country's history.

&gt;The experience in chicken processing, for example, is that Americans just don't want those jobs at anything approaching a manageable salary. 

Yes, because they pay you $5/hr because they have people who are willing to do it for $5/hr.

&gt;United States been a time when picking most produce was a job done mostly by American citizens.

Yes, mostly. Because Immigrants always made some part of the country for its entire history. Obviously when you have a section of a population that is immigrant, you will have them in every statistic.",2021-02-27 03:46:57

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

chanma50,"**Disney CEO Bob Chapek’s First Year Report Card: High Marks for Not ‘Steering it Off a Cliff’**

by DIANE HAITHMAN | March 3, 2021 @ 6:30 AM

*“Nobody knew that the whole universe of entertainment, and business, in general, would literally be turned upside down,” one industry analyst says*

Bob Chapek’s first year as CEO of entertainment giant Walt Disney Co. is largely considered a success for leading L.A.’s biggest public company through a global pandemic without, as one analyst put it, “steering it off a cliff.”

“It was the calm before the storm, literally, when Mr. Chapek took over this role,” said Comscore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian of Chapek, who replaced Bob Iger as CEO on Feb. 25, 2020,  just weeks before COVID-19 came to dominate the global conversation. “The stage was set for success, but nobody knew that the whole universe of entertainment, and business in general, would literally be turned upside down.”

At the time Chapek took over, Disney had just launched its streaming service Disney+, which had racked up more than 28 million subscribers by early February. Theme parks remained a profit center, and seven Disney films had earned more than $1 billion each at the box office in 2019, including “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” and “Avengers:Endgame,” which raked in $2 billion and is the highest grossing movie of all time (adjusting for inflation).

“And then the pandemic hit, and presented every executive, every leader in every company, with a new set of challenges, the likes of which we’ve never see before,” Dergarabedian told TheWrap. “I just have to say I think he has done an amazing job.”

Chapek addressed the issue of his first challenging year at a Morgan Stanley virtual conference on Monday, including the company’s pivot to an emphasis on direct-to-consumer content via streaming, as well as a decision to continue investing in new content despite a pandemic downturn that led to a 45% drop in Disney’s profits from Nov. 2019 to Nov. 2020, largely due to COVID-related closures of Disney theme parks, resorts and cruises.

“We essentially had to make a decision: Are we going to stay the course, (or) are we going to slow down?… but as you know, we stepped on the throttle pretty heavily and accelerated, figuring this was the time to really make a giant leap forward, if you will,” Chapek said.

When Chapek replaced Bob Iger as CEO, he was already a veteran Disney executive. He had joined Disney in 1993 and most recently had served as chairman of Disney’s Parks Experiences and Products division. At the time of his appointment, Chapek was looked on by some as an an odd choice, since his main experience was overseeing theme parks, not movie and TV content.  On the other hand, some observers pointed to the fact that parks and products represented a main driver of Disney’s success in 2019 .

Others just trusted that Iger’s track record ensured that he had made a good choice, even if it seemed counterintuitive to many: “I think it’s a smart bet; I just don’t think it’s an obvious one,” Tom Nunan, founder and partner of independent film and TV production company Bull’s Eye Entertainment, told the Los Angeles Business Journal when Chapek was appointed.

At that time, it was also announced that Iger, who had been chief executive since 2005, would remain with Disney in the role of executive chairman through the end of his contract on Dec. 31, 2021.  Along with that title, Disney said Iger would oversee “creative endeavors” in order to “ensure a smooth transition,” leading to speculation that in spite of the transition, the old Bob would be looking over the shoulder of the new Bob when it came to green lighting new movie and TV projects.

In fact, Iger never hid his intention to play a role in creative decisions. Iger, who had pushed off his retirement several times, said one reason for leaving the CEO post was to be more involved in creative affairs with Chapek on hand to oversee day-to-day affairs.  Chapek signed off on Iger’s plan, telling CNBC it was a privilege to have Iger remain on hand for guidance.

Iger’s lasting influence was apparent earlier this year. Sources confirmed to TheWrap that Iger flew to New York in January to help mitigate conflict between ABC News morning anchor George Stephanopoulos and evening anchor David Muir.

The day after the surprise announcement that Chapek would take over as CEO effective immediately, Iger and Chapek held a town hall meeting at the Disney’s Burbank headquarters. They assured the Disney team there would be no big changes in the magic game plan that had led Disney to a market cap that at that point stood at more than $221 billion, cementing its stature as one of the largest media companies in the world and the largest public company by far in greater Los Angeles.

Once the pandemic hit, however, Chapek found himself at the helm of big changes. One was restructuring the company around streaming, led by the October promotion of Kareem Daniel, former president of consumer products, games and publishing, to oversee Disney’s new media and entertainment group.

The other was massive waves of layoffs, mostly affecting the so-called “cast members,” as Disney whimsically calls the theme park staff.

In mid-November, Chapek said he was “extremely disappointed” in Gov. Gavin Newsom’s decision to keep Disneyland closed during a surge of coronavirus cases in California. In December, Disney announced it would add another 4,000 to its 28,000 layoffs by mid-2021 for a total of 32,000.

Chad Fitzgerald, a partner and entertainment litigator with Kinsella, Weitzman, Iser Kump,  said that given the “unfair curve” of the pandemic, Chapek should be given props for not steering Disney “off a cliff.” He added that the continuing success of Disney+ offsets what one might call the Disney minus of theme park losses.

As of mid-February Disney+ has nearly 95 million subscribers, compared with HBO Max’s 37.7 million subscribers (though still a long way from Netflix reported 200 million subscribers).

“Disney+ has been a beacon for them,” Fitzgerald said. “It’s been great for Disney economically.”

David Offenberg, associate professor of finance at Loyola Marymount University with an expertise in entertainment, also offered kudos to Chapek.

“What Bob Chapek walked into is, ‘Everything in the company except streaming is shutting down,'” Offenberg told TheWrap.  “What a tough start — but he was able to find the silver lining. He took the opportunity to restructure when nobody could fault him for restructuring.”",2021-03-03 22:45:23
Canadiens1993,"BlockFi is better than, say, Wells Fargo given the returns, but remains centralized.  I've become somewhat of a decentralized maximalist.  The problem with using stablecoins on BlockFi for me remains the regulatory risk associated with entrusting a centralized entity to hold my crypto such as USDC/Dai/USDT/USDG.  What's to say the US Gvt decides to crack down on stablecoins tomorrow and suspends BlockFi's ability to use them and then your funds are stuck?  Or worse, the US wakes up to the fact that it must have a controlling stake in BTC/ETH (and other crypto) in order to maintain some ""superpower"" relevance and seizes all crypto held by custodians and exchanges like BlockFi and Coinbase (not far fetched...remember what was done with gold).

I prefer DeFi options like Compound/Curve or even Harvest Finance to put my stablecoins to work.  Of course, the risk there is code (algorithms and smart contracts).  No risk, no reward - but it's a risk that advances the crypto space if it materializes and rewards you handsomely if it doesn't.

jcceagle,"The way to think about it is that a bond is a form of debt instrument. You the bondholder gets paid a coupon (interest payment) and the principal at the end of the bond (what you lend the first place when you buy the bond). 

The difference between a bond and a standard loan, is that bonds can be bought and sold, just like shares. In this example were looking at government bonds. Governments issue bonds to finance themselves. I've shown the bonds issued by three different governments i.e. Greece, Germany and the US. The yield you receive captures a mixture of both the coupon payments that you receive plus the price of the bond (if there is a capital gain or loss from the price when first bought i.e. par value). 

This yield will also differ depending on how long the bond has to maturity. Plotted together and you get a yield curve like the ones illustrated in this infographic. Economist look at these yield curves to get an understanding of the economic health of the country, inflationary pressures and interest rate risk. That's why the movement and the yield curve is interesting.",2021-03-04 15:47:45

Blockchain is more akin to a vox populi democracy - one voice, one vote. And it's taking off in Asia with Binance and BTC mining pools. GT is behind the curve on this one I think, possibly due to it's distance, cultural and geographical from the centre of finance in NY. JP Morgan, Citi, Goldman, Bridgewater, RenTec etc are all into BTC/blockchain now. Coinbase is probably going to be, along with AirBnB and Tesla, one of the lasting great companies from dot com era 2.

westcoasthotdad,"What’s crazy is that my family was composed of a father who was an Air Force overbearing asshole who adopted my when he married my mom at 5 my bio dad I never met but know who he is; my mom did her best but has intimacy issues and constantly brought me around different guys or moved them into our house, us into theirs etc.. and she was a banker so naturally pushed me towards that and that’s my field (finance). I’ve been a pretty good cook from cooking for myself when I was alone around 10+ after their divorce when they worked late and my first love is video games as an only child I spent most of my time playing. Now to the crazy part. That’s my dream! I’ve always wanted to make video games, I’m trying to push my little ones to see how to build in Roblox etc and to entertain the idea about learning to code. I always wanted to learn to code but I felt having kids it was too late to pivot having no idea how to code and the learning curve and so many languages etc

So .. do it for us both but mostly for yourself! Never give up on your dreams! Anything is possible even if it takes moving across the country or world to get a shitty job at a company you love, or living in a smaller place or with roommates or budgeting whatever .. it can be done! 

I’m not sure everything will work out as you said above with my wife etc.. we’ve grown apart because I decided to stop eating animals over a year ago and it’s been too much to process for most people around me. I’m just trying to evolve and be the best version of me to be someone others can look up to or pull inspiration from. 

Back to fmla.. your fmla has a specific length and even the idea of returning to doctors as necessary to stay on fmla was giving me anxiety, try to give yourself a really quality break and then try to find some new structure that you can implement to stay consistent with your target and goals. Be ok with leaving your job behind, in fact had I known better I would’ve taken fmla and started looking elsewhere or training while on it.

tylersburden,"Article Text: 

For the past 50 years, the Tory party had believed that high tax rates, especially on income and profits, were bad for the economy and had strived to cut them.

Today, this is no longer true: Rishi Sunak’s increase in corporation tax is the first time the rate has been raised since Denis Healey’s demented Budget of 1974, shortly after the infamous Labour chancellor had promised to squeeze the rich “until the pips squeak.” It is also a straight lift from Jeremy Corbyn’s manifesto: he wanted to raise the rate to 26 per cent; Sunak opted for a near-identikit 25 per cent.

The Tory taboo on increasing direct rates of taxation, a key ideological differentiator with Labour since Sir Edward Heath’s days, is over, and the psychological and practical consequences should fill free-marketeers with despair. Britain will continue its shift to the Left on economics, sinking ever-deeper into a social-democratic, low growth, European-style model: our choice will be between a high tax and a very high tax party. Labour will be emboldened. We will benefit from Brexit, but not by as much as we could have.

Sunak would love to be seen as the next Nigel Lawson, but the latter chainsawed the headline rate of corporation tax from 52 per cent to 35 per cent in 1984 and the top rate of income tax from 60 per cent to 40 per cent in 1988; he also simplified taxes while Sunak is making corporate levies more complex. Geoffrey Howe slashed the top rate of tax from a combined maximum of 98 per cent to 60 per cent in 1979. George Osborne sliced corporation tax rates, and took the top rate of income tax back down to 45 per cent.

Yes, the Tories also put up a lot of levies in their time – especially VAT – but there was usually a logic to their actions. They felt that taxing consumption – or petrol, or tobacco – was less damaging than taxing income from labour or capital, and they were right. They understood that there is a hierarchy of taxes: some damage the economy more than others. It is this economic and philosophical understanding that has disappeared from Tory thinking, which is fixated only on short-term politics.


Instead, much of the party has fallen foul of the Manna from Heaven theory of economics: that growth is a given, that prosperity and jobs just happen, and therefore that people and businesses can be taxed to ensure “fairness” or “equality” with no economic consequences. In this nonsensical worldview, taxation is a purely political choice, a tool to buy voters or signal virtue, not a driver of economic success or failure.

In the past, the Conservatives tried to keep taxes down overall because they believed in a causal relationship between a larger private sector and faster GDP growth. Johnson, sadly, is planning to increase spending permanently by two percentage points of GDP and taxes by one. He is a big-government Conservative, who believes that much of his extra spending will directly make the UK wealthier, and that is the real reason – not Covid – that explains why Sunak felt obliged to go against his own instincts and put up the taxes he did.

Unless he has a change of heart prior to the next election, Johnson will be remembered as one of the few Tory prime ministers – together with John Major, David Cameron and Alec Douglas-Home – who increased taxes as a share of the economy. They fell heavily during Winston Churchill’s second term and under Harold Macmillan, Anthony Eden, Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher. By contrast, Blair and Wilson dramatically jacked up the share of national income confiscated by the state, according to the TaxPayers’ Alliance.

Sunak at least defeated proponents of the magic money tree, believers in the idea that budgets never need to be balanced or that money can be borrowed indefinitely to finance unlimited spending. But this doesn’t mean that corporation tax hikes and stealth income tax rises were the answer: it would have been better to find savings in non-Covid current expenditure over time; or even to break the Tory manifesto, citing the emergency that is Covid to raise VAT. It bears repeating that the main problem facing the public finances longer-term isn’t the economic scarring from the pandemic, but the fact that the Tories are determined to keep increasing spending as if Covid never happened.

Sunak’s raid on big companies will take corporation tax receipts to their highest levels since the height of the Lawson boom, when profits were artificially inflated. This is the wrong signal to be sending to multinationals and entrepreneurs, most of whom are still spooked by Brexit. The super-deduction for capital expenditure will turbocharge investment but only for two years. The UK’s effective marginal corporation tax rate is already higher than the Brics nations and all other G7 members except France; after Sunak’s raid, our own rate will almost certainly be higher, giving Francois Mitterrandand Jacques Delors the last laugh.

The UK already raises far more from corporate taxes than other countries, as Douglas McWilliams of the CEBR points out. In 2018, Britain received 8 per cent of its receipts from corporate levies despite a headline rate of 19 per cent. France collected just 4.6 per cent of its total with a rate of 33 per cent and Germany 5.6 per cent with a rate of 30 per cent. Headline rates are psychologically important, but capital allowances and other exemptions matter hugely when it comes to the actual bill, and thus firms’ decisions to locate their operations in a particular country. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s verdict is damning: the cost of capital will rise, which will substantially reduce business investment when the super-deduction expires. That can only mean lower productivity and lower wages.

Reaganomics is over in Britain, dead and buried, as is much of the economic side of Thatcherism. Paradoxically, Johnson, who likes to quote Ibn Khaldun, the 14th century Tunisian scholar who was one of the real inventors of the Laffer curve, has felt it necessary to turn his back on the supply-side legacy of the 1980s. Until recently, the Prime Minister believed in increasing the threshold at which the 40p tax rate begins; now he is doing the opposite in real terms.

This was an avoidably bad Budget that will haunt the Tories for years to come.",2021-03-04 23:30:57

interflux,"Caltech CS here. Took an indefinite sabbatical in 2019 after finishing about 3/4 of the program. Here are my thoughts:

**Academics**

*How are the intro CS classes and teaching for a visual learner?*

Pretty good. Coming in, I had very little CS knowledge relative to my classmates, and the introductory classes made complete sense to me. They were well-paced, the concepts were well-explained, and the assignments seemed reasonable. The CS classes were some of the best classes I took at Caltech.

*What was the initial learning curve compared to high school?*

Huge - borderline incomparable. In high school I could get away with studying for 15 minutes a day and still get straight A's...at Caltech, I had to concentrate for hours just to understand a new idea introduced in class. But the knowledge gains were well worth the effort.

To be fair, the high school I went to was pretty ""soft."" If you attended a STEM-focused high school that taught curriculum beyond the AP level, you might feel more at home.

**Stress**

*How big of a stress culture is Caltech?*

Depends. There's a LOT of work, and it's generally not easy. I think most students spend about 40 to 60 hours a week on classes, homework, and studying. But the grading is fair (at least for the CS and finance courses I've taken) and there's virtually no competition between students. The atmosphere is almost exclusively collaborative. 

Actually, if you try to one-up your classmates re: grades, you will be regarded as a tool and a douchebag. Don't be that guy.

*For any bay area students that went to a high school like Gunn, Monta Vista etc. What are the culture differences at Caltech?*

I grew up in the East Bay but I attended a summer program with a couple students from Gunn and they seemed like typical nice, hard-working, STEM nerds. I dunno, I think they would have fit in well at Caltech.

**Diversity**

*I have been at pretty undiverse schools most of my life. Think 95% white. I saw caltech is 60% male and 80% asian+white. Is this noticible on campus? Does it feel very homogeneous?*

Yes and yes. Racial diversity is one of Caltech's biggest weak points IMO. They're working on it, but they have a long way to go.

No strong opinion about the gender ratio. It didn't stand out to me when I was there, but this is coming from a somewhat-clueless cishet male.

**Career Outlook**

*I want to spend most of young years working on start ups, in a quant role, or at a Stripe, Uber type company. How is recruiting for places like Jane Street and other top firms? How is the start up culture and how much access do you have to blossoming companies at early stages?*

I think recruiting by the kinds of companies you mentioned is great at Caltech, both for tech and for finance. My impression is going to a top company is pretty much the norm - I knew multiple self-described ""bottom of the pack"" students who received Google offers their senior year. Here is an abridged list of companies that recruit from Caltech, either at the career fair or via tech talks (or both):

* Google
* Facebook
* Apple
* Microsoft
* Nvidia
* Palantir
* D.E. Shaw Research
* Morgan Stanley
* Goldman Sachs
* Citadel
* Jane Street
* Two Sigma
* TGS Management Company

You get the idea. That said, while I think going to Caltech will get you noticed by top companies, you still have to pass the technical interviews. I've seen great students have trouble getting offers because they didn't prepare sufficiently.

**Graduate-School Outlook**

*Can an average caltech student feed into top 5 CS PhD programs?*

Most CS students I knew didn't apply to graduate school, but FWIW here are the graduate schools of the eight students I know of who majored in CS as undergraduates and entered Ph.D. programs for CS as well:

* 4x Carnegie Mellon
* 1x MIT
* 1x Stanford
* 1x U. Mich.
* 1x Cornell

So...yes? But there could be an effect of students applying to top-5 programs, not getting in, and going into industry instead of attending a ""lower ranked"" graduate school.

*What is the law school potential for caltech?*

No idea...

**Final**

*If given the option, knowing my parents saved up 120k for college, would you go to Vanderbilt of Caltech (with my above goals and concerns)? Price difference I think Vanderbilt would be 11k (0 with parents money) for housing and food, Caltech would be 77k (47k with parents money)*

Probably Vanderbilt. I don't think tech companies care that much about what school you went to. If you have a B.S. or a couple years' experience in the field, you can get an interview at a top tech company. Once you have the interview, nobody gives a crap about your on-paper credentials. And I'm sure you'd receive a great CS education at Vanderbilt.

Are you really not receiving any money from Caltech, though? Caltech is quite generous with financial aid, even if your parents have a decent income. The financial-aid office is pretty friendly - I think it's worth reaching out to them and seeing if they can work with you on this one.

Good luck!",2021-03-10 00:58:46

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies. 

If you are using RH or WB that don't allow pennystocks there is a subreddit r/RobinHoodPennyStocks .
On NASDAQ many options like CTRM + SNDL + DGLY + HIMX + CIDM + NOK + ATOM+ ENG

MrSnagsy,"I'm sorry to hear that this happened to you and your post is very helpful but this is not a Swyftx issue, it's the nature of crypto currencies.

&gt;  I was warned not to leave crypto on an exchange so I bought a Ledger wallet as suggested

You knew this and still you left a large amount of funds/coins on the exchange rather than transferring to your hardware wallet.

&gt; I can't wait for some smarty to tell me the error of my ways as the lack of empathy on some sites is overwhelming. I should have known this or that - but surely that is not the point. 

Unfortunately this **is** the point. If you are investing then the onus is on you to perform your due diligence and understand the risks, both in terms of market volatility but also the risk of loss/theft/destruction etc.

&gt; Where are the protections - such as insurance? 

This is a great question. Welcome to the brave new world of anonymous, decentralised finance. We are way too early on the adoption curve for insurance companies to know how this all works. It's the wild west to them so they don't want to get involved.

Even saying that, I'm sure it would be possible for an exchange such as Swyftx to take out a policy with an insurer. However, they would then be completely noncompetitive due not only to insurance costs but the additional development and operational costs due to the constraints and requirements put on them by the insurer.

People invest in crypto because they want very high returns. The trade off is complexity of the market and the underlying technology as well as the risks involved.

&gt; DO NOT leave cash or currency on the Platform!

Great advice but true of every platform.

&gt; I had 2FA so I believe the Swyft systems are defective and do not protect their customers as they should

This is an interesting claim and one that I'd like to hear someone from Swyftx respond to. 2FA hacks are difficult and it would be unusual for some rando Aussie crypto investor to be targeted. I'm also curious as to how someone was able to validate a new withdrawal address. Was your account email changed? Or your email account hacked?",2021-03-10 06:31:01

sdpthrowaway3,"Sure. I got in by shooting out 50 applications. Got some bites. Ended up speaking to these 2 guys for over 2 hours during what was a 30 minute interview. They liked me, I liked them, rest is history. It also helped I audited some carve-outs and had M&amp;A experience as well as analytics reviewing.

TBH its hard to get more finance oriented analyst roles out of B4 if you're not TAS or FDD. I got lucky because my entire vertical is either B4 Advisory or CFAs. They took me because they had a NEED for an analyst and felt they could teach me anything I needed to know being ex-B4 myself. Learning curve is pretty fucking steep being an old auditor, but totally manageable. My individual work hours are way harder, but I work a fraction as much, and it's a much less stressful environment. They actually care when I say something needs to push or I can't do a task.

Best part: My work is always used by someone. If a BU President wants to see how the US branches are operating and which workers are doing good/poor and why, he comes to me. The other day I got to value a potential acquisition for a company and the SVP for the BU sat with me to ask how I came to my conclusions and thoughts on how their book can help Financials vs how much they'll cost, likelihood of 3.5x RoI, etc.

Worst part: There is no passing work to the next guy. I am the guy. I have to find a way somehow and I hold WAY more responsibility than I did as an Auditor. Its kind of a failure is not an option thing. Sure, my peers and managers are more than willing to help, but I have to nut up and do. There is no ""just existing"" or putting in years to stay employed and promoted. If I don't hit metrics, I dont get promoted. If I underperformed, I am replaced. I dont see thes etchings being an issue though.",2021-03-10 08:56:13
burdalane,"I graduated almost 20 years ago, so some things might have changed.

1. I'm not sure how Caltech classes would be for a visual learner. I might have done better if I were more of a visual learner -- I have trouble thinking in three dimensions. For me, the learning curve at Caltech was very steep. I did not feel prepared for Caltech, and I had taken and gotten 5s in AP-level calculus and physics, among other AP subjects.
2. Caltech was very stressful, but collaboration is encouraged. For the most part, Caltech students more likely to work together than one-up each other about grades. However, I knew some people who bragged about their grades and how much they were overloading and Caltech being too easy. 
3. When I was a student, only one third of the student population was female. The ratio is now closer to 50-50 among undergrads. Caltech is not majority white -- almost 50% of the undergrad population is Asian-American -- and there are international students, too, but many people don't consider this diverse in the typical sense.
4. Top companies in both tech and finance recruit at Caltech. The startup scene at Caltech is not huge, but there is an entrepreneurship club. Some of my classmates, after graduating, went to work for Silicon Valley startups that became todays' big tech. Since they were early employees, they cashed out and are now VCs or founders themselves. My own career hasn't been that great.

5) Some Caltech students go on to top PhD programs. However, one of the issues with Caltech is the relatively strict grading. Someone graduating from Caltech might have a lower GPA than someone comparable graduating from an easier but also prestigious school. I don't know how much graduate programs take difficulty into account.

It isn't uncommon for Caltech alumni to become patent attorneys. I know of someone who became a trial lawyer after working in engineering and argued in front of the Supreme Court.",2021-03-10 09:42:12

hollow_hippie,"&gt; It’s that time of year, Austin voters. The redbud trees have come out, signaling spring. Also coming out in time to remind us that we have choices to make in the May election are people paid to knock on our doors. So don’t be surprised when a block walker from Restore Leadership ATX knocks on your door to tell you that Proposition F “threatens the progress Austin made when we changed to the 10-1 district system which gave representation to all parts of Austin.”
&gt; 
&gt; The group sponsoring Restore Leadership ATX opposes Prop F, the citizen-sponsored initiative to change Austin’s current city manager-Council form of government to a strong-mayor system. The group that collected enough signatures to put Prop F and four others on the May 1 ballot will no doubt be campaigning any day now.
&gt; 
&gt; Ellen Wood is listed as campaign treasurer for Restore Leadership ATX and she also donated $10,000 to the PAC, according to the flyer the Austin Monitor received opposing Prop F. Wood, president and CEO of Virtual CFO, told the Monitor via email, “We think the consolidation of power in one person is regressive. It appears we are aligned with Austinites all across the city, including AFSCME, business leaders and members of the City Council, in opposition to Proposition F.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mike Levy, a civic activist and former publisher of Texas Monthly, contributed $25,000 to the PAC. He said he had heard that people “across the political spectrum say they’re against it because they’re afraid (Council Member) Greg Casar would be the first strong mayor.”
&gt; 
&gt; Asked to comment on that, Wood said, “Our PAC is very concerned about the idea of anyone becoming a strong mayor. It is hard to understand how diluting the voices of the 10-1 City Council and giving veto power to one person is ‘progressive.’ Words like that are being used deliberately in an effort to obscure the reality and avoid a discussion on the merits (or lack) of what this change would mean.”
&gt; 
&gt; Other major contributors to the PAC include Cumby Development, which donated $50,000; David Roche of Endeavor, who gave $20,000; and former publisher Chris Harte, who donated $10,000.
&gt; 
&gt; Bryan Cumby, the founder of Cumby Development, said late Tuesday, “I think it is one of the most important issues that has come before voters in a very long time. I’ve been in and out of the local political scene over the past 30 years or so and I don’t think this is a move that Austin should be making.”
&gt; 
&gt; Cumby added that adopting the strong-mayor form of government would negate the city’s recent move to the 10-1 system of representation. The city can have a strong mayor without overturning the current system, he said, pointing to former mayor (and former state senator) Kirk Watson as a good example.
&gt; 
&gt; East Austin activist Frances Acuña is the campaign treasurer for another political action committee, Austinites for Democracy Dollars. Acuña filed paperwork for the specific purpose committee on Feb. 28, appointing herself to the job. The PAC intends to support Proposition H, colloquially known as Democracy Dollars.
&gt; 
&gt; The ballot language for Prop H asks: “Shall the City Charter be amended to adopt a public campaign finance program, which requires the city clerk to provide up to two $25 vouchers to every registered voter who may contribute them to candidates for city office who meet the program requirements?”
&gt; 
&gt; Those who favor this proposition say it would give citizens of less affluent districts a chance to participate financially in their district elections. The idea behind this proposition is that people who live in more affluent Council districts are able to give money both to candidates within their home districts and in other districts. An argument against this proposition is that candidates should raise their own money and not depend on city dollars.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, there is a new filing from a group called the Protect and Serve PAC. Charles Gantt of Beverly, Massachusetts, is listed as the treasurer at an address for Bulldog Compliance. Bulldog Compliance is a division of Redcap Curve Solutions, which states that it provides “comprehensive treasury, budgeting, and FEC (Federal Election Commission) compliance services for political action committees and other fundraising-driven organizations.”",2021-03-10 22:50:23

Fake_William_Shatner,"&gt; ""I was born with very wealthy, educated, and well connected parents, so why didn't I get the opportunities I was worthy of?""

That would not sound odd. Everyone with that background is typically EXPECTED to succeed. It's the pressure that upper middle class people feel.

&gt;Maybe it sounds weird because of how you define being worthy? 

I didn't really define it. In an objective sense -- and through the eyes of my mother, I could say I ""might be worthy"" -- if anyone deserves things. But spiritually, I think everyone is worthy. Life however, doesn't care. And then my sense of self bounces around from feeling unworthy to owed. I pretty much think that's how it is fore normal empathetic people -- but not for about half the people who think they are owed and deserve and usually say; ""life doesn't owe you anything"" or ""bootstraps"" because obviously -- they got the stuff. Having the reward to most people is proof they deserved it and were smarter and harder working. Confirmation bias.

&gt;Well, what exactly was it that you did to be born with the IQ you have? 

I managed to have skills in certain areas that look good on tests and communicated at a college level at 9 years old. Possibly the age skews the results. However, I was also dealing with ADD, ADHD and and some dyslexia. I think I'm not as good as most people in common every day skills they take for granted -- like navigating roads or remembering names. But, I have a couple two areas where I might be world class that they don't have on a test. It's an ability to think in more than 4 dimensions and creative problem solving. 

But, talking about myself this way is never fun, and usually gets a lot of shit -- because people think you are bragging but really -- it's about understanding. It usually sucks being at the end of any curve.

&gt;Did you do something that required more effort and determination than the person born in the bourgeoisie family?

Hard to say. I might have struggled more adapting to normal life and feelings of alienation. Maybe the family dynamic was better or worse than others. But I also had advantages. At times I had it easy because of the brain, but procrastinated like crap and had little concentration due to allergies that affected these things. Then there was bipolar depression ups and downs that were not correctly diagnosed for decades. At one time I worked a few jobs and 70-80 hours a week because I wanted to get ahead - and I just didn't know how to get the functional basics of business to be an entrepreneur. Want to solve a problem? I can come up with a dozen ways -- and maybe one idea would work. But, in hindsight -- I was right about a lot of technology and how it would be designed. 

&gt;so they rely on your resume, which favors experience anyway.

Well -- employers also want someone who JUST DID what they want. Meaning; if you were doing technical manuals for medical education software, working in finance, or suddenly shifting to IT or the like -- they think you are unfocused. But I've never left a job -- they always left me. Of course, doing the normal things that everyone evaluates you on is extra work for me -- and I was never used for what I'm actually good at.

&gt;Sure, likely a lot of truth to that, so what exactly was your method to get a large audience, or at least the right audience to notice you?

Blogging. Tried creating a few websites early on but that got nowhere because I have a tough time staying with anything beyond figuring it out. Doing a photo realistic self portrait getting hung on the walls at the college -- and I'm done doing pencil sketches. I don't really enjoy much of anything and don't want to do it unless it's the best. Which made it a struggle to keep pushing with 3D apps that were mediocre. If I'd had some mentoring in anything where I was working alongside the best -- I might be at the top of many fields.

Everything I do, I had to come up with on my own. Other than school -- nobody showed me anything. And everything I've made a living at was not taught in school.

So now of course, I'm at a law office.

&gt;&gt; Big boobs ... Nepotism.

Never had nepotism pave the way --- which is probably the biggest boost you can get in life. Does Harvard make the best comic writers and lawyers and 
CEO's? I think it's more of a positive feedback loop where you are born on 3rd base, and the scouts are there in the stadium, and someone who knows someone will praise you for tying your shoe correctly. I think almost everyone with the same conditions will excel. We just don't admit it to ourselves because we are taught exceptionalism.

I'm actually different and exceptional and I'm actually amazed I'm not insane and homeless. I figure most people who are without the right outlet end up that way -- NOT the cream rising to the top. They are more hot-house flowers, more sensitive, more intense and more obnoxious than average. 

&gt;&gt;If your sons were instead ugly, would that imply they wouldn't be worthy of affection?

You probably know the answer; attractive people get more likes on Instagram. Just the reality. My son now has a few and he is absolutely corny. But he just doesn't have the confidence and ""game"" to land the ladies.

The second son is deep and brooding and actually could get more relationships even though he's not seen as traditionally handsome. But, you know, it's complicated in relationships now. They are super empathetic and we all know that bad boys get the girls. Everyone says ""respect"" and yet every kid getting to 2nd base is playing the numbers as a creep. 

&gt;I will say though, I hope ""the system"" changes in a way that can better utilize the talents of those that posses them,

Better yet to give everyone all they need. I recognize that there are different forms of intelligence and they are useful in different situations. My brain would be awesome for a CEO at an innovative company -- but, there's really not an internship for that. CEO's son at Harvard will get a phone call from someone on the board of another company. It's more of a feedback loop than Hollywood stars getting on a Disney sitcom.",2021-03-11 04:09:20

aimixin,"Very good post. A lot of the people who claim China is not socialist in my experience just don't get historical materialism. They view Marx's descriptions of a socialist society as a prescription of what kind of laws you should implement. They think the abolition of private property is purely a legal concept and claim countries like China or Cuba which have legalized private property therefore aren't socialist.

They don't understand that Marx's descriptions of a socialist society were not simply prescriptions for how a society *ought* to be, but scientific predictions of how the society *will* change as the material foundations of society evolve through the development of the productive forces. Hence, immediately banning all private property would not make much sense from a Marxian perspective, as this is not simply a *legal* thing.

&gt;“What merits our attention here is that our socialist state was established by a proletarian party that has a grasp of historical materialism and is dedicated to communism. With such a party controlling the state power, it is possible for our country to promote changes in the relations of production according to its own will. If, instead of proceeding from realities, we try to change the relations of production according to our wishful thinking, the result may be that the relations of production will go beyond the requirements of the growth of the productive forces, which may thus be disrupted. In 1958, for instance, people’s communes, “large in size and having a high degree of public ownership” as Mao Zedong put it, were set up throughout the country, and there rose the premature “communist wind” characterized by the attempt to effect a transition to communism. All this made agricultural production drop greatly.”  
&gt;  
&gt;— Xue Muqiao, “China’s Socialist Economy”

That quote from Engels on how private property cannot be abolished immediately is very good. It also says the same thing in the \_Manifesto\_ itself. Somehow people read the part about the abolition of private property but then miss the part where Marx and Engels describes how they would actually carry that out in practice.

&gt;""The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, ***by degree***, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling class; and ***to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.***""

I also tend to think one of the biggest misunderstandings is a categorical problem in how people define ""socialism"". They read Engels's definition of socialism and then believe that socialism can only exist in the purist of the pure form. To them, when Engels says socialism abolishes private property, they think that means socialism must completely 100% abolish all private property immediately, and that any private property, since it contradicts socialism, must prove the society is not socialist.

But as Engels said, contradiction does not mean absurdity. 

&gt;“…contradiction=absurdity, and therefore cannot occur in the real world. People who in other respects show a fair degree of common sense may regard this statement as having the same self-evident validity as the statement that a straight line cannot be a curve and a curve cannot be straight. But, regardless of all protests made by common sense, the differential calculus under certain circumstances nevertheless equates straight lines and curves, and thus obtains results which common sense, insisting on the absurdity of straight lines being identical with curves, can never attain…True, so long as we consider things as at rest and lifeless, each one by itself, alongside and after each other, we do not run up against any contradictions in them…But the position is quite different as soon as we consider things in their motion, their change, their life, their reciprocal influence on one another. Then we immediately become involved in contradictions.”  
&gt;  
&gt;— Friedrich Engels, “Anti-Durhing”

While it is true private property contradicts with socialism, it is also at the same not true that a contradiction between socialism proves the society is not socialist. This is not how Marx and Engels used categories. Categories are not absolute and unchanging things. There is no such thing as ""pure"" capitalism where there is absolutely nothing within that society that contradicts capitalism. There is no such as ""pure"" socialism either. There couldn't be. Marx's ideas of dialectical materialism would make no sense if categories were all completely pure, because how does a contradiction arise and develop quantitatively over time enough to eventually lead to a qualitative change, if contradictions are not allowed in the real world? What is important for the definition of a category is not that it exists in absolute purity, but what is the dominant aspect. Many things will exist in contradiction in every system, but the dominant aspect of the contradiction is what defines it, which is what puts it in the category of ""socialism"" or ""capitalism"".

&gt;“What is the method of synthesis? Is it possible that primitive society can exist side-by-side with slave-holding society? They do exist side-by-side, but this is only a small part of the whole. The overall picture is that primitive society is going to be eliminated…In a word, one devours another, one overthrows another, one class is eliminated, another class rises, one society is eliminated, another society rises. Naturally, in the process of development, everything is not all that pure. When it gets to feudal society, there still remains something of the slaveholding system, though the greater part of the social edifice is characterized by the feudal system. There are still some serfs, and also some bond-workers, such as handicraftsmen. Capitalist society isn’t all that pure either, and even in more advanced capitalist societies there is also a backward part. For example, there was the slave system in the Southern United States. Lincoln abolished the slave system, but there are still black slaves today, their struggle is very fierce. More than 20 million people are participating in it, and that’s quite a few. One thing destroys another, things emerge, develop, and are destroyed, everywhere is like this. If things are not destroyed by others, then they destroy themselves.”  
&gt;  
&gt;— Mao Zedong, “Talk On Question of Philosophy”

Besides not understanding historical materialism or dialectical categories, a lot just don't know facts. I've met several who think China is like the US, some even telling me it is ""the most free market capitalist country possible"" despite private ownership literally only making up 31% of employment with 50% public and 19% collective, despite the fact that most of this private employment is in urban areas where all land is owned publicly, alongside most finance capital, which both are essential towards building any enterprise. Or they just buy into all the anti-PRC propaganda they see on television and believe it is some giant prison complex or something.

Of course, all these kinds of people I mention are leftists who dislike China. Rightists also make the same claims about China being a capitalist country, but it usually isn't due to a misunderstanding of China but intentionally misrepresenting facts to try and make it look like capitalism is what turned China is a world power. I even saw a PBS documentary (US state media) where they tried to claim that Deng Xiaoping abandoned Marxism to embrace full capitalism, that collective ownership doesn't exist anywhere in China but in one small town, and that there was no growth and development under Mao and it was all famine the whole time, and today China is a capitalist society in a ""post-communist era"". Rightists also make these absurd claims on China and you see it in a lot of western propaganda because it helps construct a historically false narrative that Marxism destroyed China until they abandoned it to embrace capitalism. You won't change the minds of those kinds of people because they are intentionally trying to construct a historically false narrative to fit their agenda.",2021-03-11 21:49:37
PrincePryda,"Hey, I kind of share a similar experience so I figured I'd share it.

I graduated with a 3.98 GPA with a concentration in Finance. It was my second to last semester when I passed CFA L1 that my Portfolio Management professor went out of her way to mention my name to the partner of a firm where she does consulting work. She wrote me an email over winter break telling me she mentioned my name, and that if I was interested, to send in my resume for an internship. All this transpired without me knowing about it until her email, so I was extremely ecstatic and grateful. 

Fast forward to post-interview, I get the job and because this was May 2020, COVID forced us to begin my internship at home. At first it was nice and easy - I was in charge of creating a weekly newsletter highlighting major fixed income events and curve shifts (IG/HY spreads). As time went on, things got a bit more and more complex, and while I was able to figure out most of it (with A LOT of help from reddit's CFA subreddit), I felt like I was lagging really hard. I couldn't understand the big picture when we spoke about a lot of things, and I barely spoke during any of our meetings (it was a combination of nervousness and not understanding enough to make insightful comments). 

At the end of the internship, I got a part-time offer and management told me that they'd be more than happy to reach out to their network and help me land a full-time offer. In other words, I felt like this was an extremely polite way of telling me to screw. It hurt, but I feel that we're learning how to be more resilient. Working from home is ABSOLUTELY a way harder challenge then being in the office - especially when you're fresh out of college. Don't be so hard on yourself. I worked so many late hours (often into the early morning) and tried my best to impress, but in the end I learnt that quantity of work doesn't always improve the quality of work. 

I'm registered for L2 and am constantly reminding myself to focus on the bigger picture. What are we trying to do with this information? How do portfolio managers interpret and act on information? Where can I find articles that outline their line of thinking? These are all questions I ask myself because I want to be a PM, and I'm sure with enough time and hard work I'll get there. 

I guess my point is - don't stop trying. Focus on the CFA exam - there are so many intelligent people on the CFA subreddit that are more than willing to help you, and tons of people of this subreddit that are willing to guide you (I met an awesome guy on here who helped me through my Fidelity interview process and managed to get all the way to the final round)!

If your claims department has an analytics, operations, or finance department that supports claim i would start building relationships there to figure out how you can get data. If you have any connections to any actuaries that serve claim or reserving they can also be helpful. From there its about finding claim data for your line. Getting data exports to excel are a great way to start for early beginners to familiarize yourself with the data and try some rudimentary analysis. If youre able to find data from the line of business you support you can use your knowledge as an adjuster/claim handler etc to build analysis you think would be helpful. Learn skills and technologies like SQL and a viz software in your free time with publicly available data and see how you can get involved in building metrics or tracking patterns. The insurance industry has a bit of a learning curve to fully understand so you being well versed will be a good advantage for your career prospects in claim analytics or claim operations over others not familiar.

andrew991116,"Good questions! I'm a finance/IS major, so the answers will mainly be from this perspective:    
  
1. You still have to go through the same weed-out classes, since they are the basic lower division classes, but they aren't really weed-out for you, since you are already in the major. You can still get kicked out if your GPA is too low, but the GPA for a normal Foster application is way higher (like 3.6 I think?) than the GPA threshold for Foster kicking people out (which is like 2.7 or something I think). There is a chance of being kicked out, but you don't really have to worry about it unless you slack off everyday.   
(Just as a tip though, just because you graduated with a 4.0 GPA in high school doesn't mean that you'll get straight 4.0s at UW...speaking from experience! It's pretty much impossible. Don't look at college GPAs like high school GPAs. You'll probably get a freshman bomb, like I did with a 3.0 in Econ 200. Learn from that experience &amp; you'll recover)  
  
2. Alright, here's the tough truth. It's super hard (but not impossible) to get into a Wall Street firm if you go to UW. They simply haven't heard of you. Most Foster students will probably end up in corporate finance or some other firms. Now, this isn't bad, and the pay is still good, but I just want to temper your expectations.  
If you want to get into the Wall Street stuff, you REALLY GOTTA HUSTLE and network early. Apply for sophomore internship programs, cold message on LinkedIn, etc.   

3.   It's overall pretty solid, but the department standard is like a 3.0 curve or something, meaning that median grades will get a 3.0 GPA. I don't think this applies to the lower division classes, but it's pretty annoying for easy classes, since you can get a 96% and still get a 3.7 or 3.8.  
Once you get past the lower division classes, you'll notice that the classes goes from 4 to 5 credits, and are generally offered in two 2-hour blocks rather than daily, like some departments. You'll also notice that most Foster students don't have classes on Fridays.  
Why is the course load so low? It's because the department really implicitly encourages you to build real-life experience via stuff like group projects, which takes up some time, but the free time really also opens you up for other opportunities, such as clubs, minors, double options, internships, jobs, etc. Really use your time well and you'll notice that a lot more doors will be opened for you.  
Business isn't a super technical degree. A lot of soft skills are required but aren't taught in classes. You'll build those skills as you pursue those extracurricular opportunities.",2021-03-12 14:46:22

https://ragingbull.com/kb/how-to-make-money-with-penny-stocks/

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies. 

If you are using RH or WB that don't allow pennystocks there is a subreddit r/RobinHoodPennyStocks .
On NASDAQ many options like CTRM + SNDL + DGLY + HIMX + CIDM + NOK + ATOM+ ENG

Kid_Cornelius,"Wasn't the Laffer curve one of the inspirations behind Reaganomics? That alone is a pretty scathing condemnation.

&gt;Laffer assumes that the government's revenue is a continuous function of the tax rate. However, in some theoretical models, the Laffer curve can be discontinuous, leading to an inability to devise a revenue-maximizing tax rate solution. Additionally, the Laffer curve depends on the assumption that tax revenue is used to provide a public good that is separable in utility and separate from labor supply, which may not be true in practice.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Laffer curve as presented is simplistic in that it assumes a single tax rate and a single labor supply. Actual systems of public finance are more complex, and there is serious doubt about the relevance  of considering a single marginal tax rate. In addition, revenue may well be a [multivalued function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivalued_function) of tax rate; for instance, an increase in tax rate to a certain percentage may not result in the same revenue as a decrease in tax rate to the same percentage (a kind of [hysteresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis)). Furthermore, the Laffer curve does not take explicitly into account the nature of the tax avoidance taking place. It is possible that if all  producers are endowed with two survival factors in the market (ability to produce efficiently and ability to avoid tax), then the revenues raised under tax avoidance can be greater than without avoidance, and thus the Laffer curve maximum is found to be farther right than thought. The reason for this result is that if producers with low productive abilities (high production costs) tend to have strong avoidance abilities as well, a uniform tax on producers actually becomes a tax that discriminates on the ability to pay. However, if avoidance abilities and productive abilities are unrelated, then this result  disappears.

daymonhandz,"# What is Schnorr/Taproot?

The update known as “Schnorr/Taproot” consists of three Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), new code proposals to improve Bitcoin Core, the reference client used to run the Bitcoin protocol. The BIP #340 adds so called “Schnorr signatures”, the BIP #341 adds “Taproot” and the BIP #342 adds “Tapscript”. As Schnorr signatures and Taproot are the most consequential parts of this update, we will focus on them here.

Schnorr/Taproot is the culmination of years of work. The idea of Taproot was proposed by Bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell Taproot in January 2018. Another Bitcoin developer, Pieter Wuille, created the proposal to implement the idea in September 2019. It then went through an extensive review and test phase, with 150 developers participating in a 7 weeks long review process in November 2019. The code is going to be implemented in the next release of Bitcoin Core, in December 2020 – but it doesn’t even mean it will actually be adopted by participants in the Bitcoin network.

The Taproot proposal builds on top of Schnorr signatures. The main function of Schnorr signatures is to make “multi-signature” (multisig) transactions, which require multiple signatures to be processed, and traditional, single signature transactions (called P2PKH, for ‘pay-to-public-key-hash’ transactions), look the same on the blockchain. The function of Taproot is to extend this approach to other, more complex sorts of transactions (called P2SH, for ‘pay-to-script-hash’ transactions) and also make them look like traditional P2PKH transactions.

How does that work? The fundamental benefit of Schnorr signatures is that they allow for key and signature aggregation. This means that it becomes possible to combine different public keys into a new, single one. Say Alice and Bob’s signatures are required for a multisig payment to John: thanks to Schnorr, it is possible to combine Signature A and Signature B into Signature C. When Alice and Bob provide their (so-called ‘treshold’) signatures and public keys, only “Signature C to John” will appear on the blockchain. The transaction will therefore look like a traditional single signature transaction from C to John.

#What everyday users gain from the update: privacy and fungibility

What does the Schnorr/Taproot upgrade change for the everyday user? In a nutshell, it increases the fungibility and privacy of Bitcoin. For a currency to be ‘fungible’, all of its individual units need to be indistinguishable from any other unit. The US Dollar is fungible because any individual 1$ bill is worth the exact same. One dollar bill could have been used to pay for illegal drugs, another to fund a wedding, their past use will not change their value: they’re worth the exact same. Currently, because transactions are publicly broadcasted on the blockchain, and because different types of transactions have different digital fingerprints, it is fairly easy to obtain identifying information about specific transactions. Being able to identify the past use of certain coins can ‘taint’ them and make them less valuable than ‘clean’ coins. This is a significant threat to Bitcoin’s fungibility and to its prospects as a currency. With Schnorr signatures, and even more with Taproot, all transactions appear to be of the same kind on the blockchain. It renders much harder to know if a certain transaction was a one-to-one payment (from Alice to Bob) or a complex transaction, involving multiple signatures, time based conditions, or the Lightning network. It is therefore a net fungibility gain.

Schnorr/Taproot increases the privacy of Bitcoin in a similar way. By analyzing a multisig transaction, one can also identify the specific multisig set-up that was used, the ways the success conditions of a certain smart contract have been met, the type of wallet that was used, etc. Obfuscating this information is a great privacy gain for Bitcoin users. But the upgrade doesn’t benefit only the average user.

#What developers and exchanges gain from the update: efficiency and flexibility

The upgrade also benefits two other groups: Bitcoin developers and crypto exchanges. Bitcoin currently uses Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signatures, which usually weigh around 72 bytes, while Schnorr signatures weigh 64 bytes. So the switch from one standard to the other already comes with a 11-12% gain in efficiency. But there is more because, as mentioned above, Schnorr signatures allow for signature aggregation. Imagine that Alice, Bob and John need to sign a transaction, as it is common in multisig schemes which require 3 out of 5 signatures. This means that 3 signatures would have to be broadcasted to the blockchain: that of Alice, Bob and John. The more signatures are needed, the more the size of the transaction increases, the higher the transaction fees get. So, with ECDSA signatures, the more complex the smart contract, the more expensive it gets to run it. By allowing for complex smart contracts to be executed by a single signature, the Schnorr/Taproot upgrade greatly reduces the cost of running smart contracts. 

This helps developers because it means they can write more complex smart contracts on top of Bitcoin without putting a heavy burden on the blockchain. It also helps exchanges and other key actors of the Bitcoin ecosystem because it means they can run complex smart contracts, such as multisig wallets and timelock transactions, for much cheaper. **It is expected that the compounded efficiency gains of the upgrade could make the fees exchanges are paying drop by up to 30%.** The gain in flexibility and efficiency will help scale the different endeavours to bring DeFi (decentralized finance) features to Bitcoin.

#Cooperation towards adoption

The new version of Bitcoin Core implements the code for BIPs 340, 341 and 342, respectively Schnorr signatures, Taproot and Tapscript. It does not mean that this new code will be activated immediately however. First, the code will have to be activated on ‘signet’ and/or ‘testnet’, the Bitcoin blockchains exclusively used for testing. Such a big change, indeed, has required extensive review and will require further testing. Testing is absolutely key to maintain the security of the Bitcoin network, and is a central part of the work of Bitcoin Core developers. 

When the activation code will be included in Bitcoin Core, the miners will have to signal (or not) their willingness to adopt it. At the moment, the sum of the miners who control 91% of the hashrate on the Bitcoin network and have expressed a firm opinion are in favor of activating Taproot. There are different ways to go about the activation process, the two main ones are discussed on a dedicated website. 

Even if the upgrade is activated by the miners, it will remain necessary for wallet developers, exchange engineers and other key infrastructure workers to update their services too for the upgrade to be fully functional. Contrary to what happened in 2017 with the block-size limit controversy, this time it seems like miners, developers, exchanges and users all see the benefits of working together to make the most of this upgrade. What the Schnorr/Taproot upgrade shows, therefore, is also that the Bitcoin community at large has truly understood the virtuous circle of innovation and cooperation Bitcoin itself is based on.

jpdoctor,"&gt; I think we’re seeing institutional rebalancing triggering market conditions that allow more institutions to get in

I'd expand this point: Board members are herd creatures.  Now that the first corporate entrants (Saylor, Musk etc) have made loud purchases of bitcoin, and since their returns are very visible, I'd expect a new round of cash-rich companies to follow.  This is still the bottom of the S-curve though, and eventually the finance subcommittees of public boards will be asking CFOs ""Why don't we have a few percent of bitcoin to hedge inflation?""

I'll confess to smoking major amounts of hopium, but I genuinely believe it's a very exciting time, maybe the most exciting since the whitepaper was published.",2021-03-15 07:23:57

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies.

bridgeton_man,"I'm a classical capitalist (ie, I'm into classical and neoclassical econ, and I work in finance). As far as this sub is concerned, that somehow makes me a centrist. 

What I'm sick of hearing is:

- Ancaps saying that markets do not have and do not depend on any sort of formalism (ie...statism). Centuries of capitalist thinkers dating to Adam Smith himself are pretty clear on the need for formal property rights, contract law, competition policy, and other things that today's main capitalist markets have either enshrined in law, or otherwise formalized. 

- Sick of Austrians saying that monetary policy is either somehow evil and mysterious, but then running for cover the moment that you start debating the QTOM, phillips curve and the law of supply and demand. Also sick of them saying that its monetary policy that drives the business cycle, when anybody over 29 has lived through at least THREE major international economic downturns that had to do with external shocks (such as the Real Business Cycle Theory predicts).

- Sick of dudes on both sides of the aisle saying that empiricism and  and statistical analysis to predict market behaviour is not a thing. I can see how people 100 years ago theorized that. What makes zero sense is how people that live during the era of big-data, where Bezos is the world's richest man, and when capitalist markets are dominated by Amazon, Google, FB, and others try in earnest to pretend that this isn't so. It IS so. 

- Sick of socialists getting all worked up saying that our current economic order is based on historical exploitation, as if there were ever a period in history when that were NOT true. 

-  Also sick of socialists pretending that there is no value in the banking system or the financial markets. As if Y = C+I+X+G  were not a thing. As if investment did not drive economic growth, and as if regional / sectoral specialization &amp; expertise in investments were not a thing. 

- Georgists believe (as far as I can tell), that they can replace all taxes with ONE tax and that the economy will prosper. As if de-diversifying anything ever worked for any macroeconomy ever. That being said, I've only been argued-at by that faction once.",2021-03-15 19:10:07

CreepyAssociation8,"When I was five years old, my sister and I were in a car accident. She was 16 and pretty responsible for somebody her age.  It was summer break in the 90’s and my mom needed my sister to take our van to get new tires put on.  My mom managed a finance office and did not like taking time off work because everyone always depended heavily on her.  Instead, My sister took me along with her and her boyfriend, now husband, to get the tires put on.  When we were done we took my brother-in-law home and headed back to our place.  My sister hates country music, but I talked her into playing Boot Scootin Boogie on cassette tape.  The highway we took to get home from her bfs was known to be pretty dangerous, a lot of bends and curves.  When rounding a particularly bad curve, a truck swerved into our lane and flipped the van over and into a ditch.  After the impact, the first thing I remember was looking over and seeing my sister bloodied from the face to her stomach. She was trying to unbuckle my seatbelt to help me out,but she couldn’t even hold her head up.  First responders found me in the back of the van trying to get out and screaming for help. They use the jaws of life to get my sister out and broke the radio because that song was stuck on repeat and it was starting to freak the first responders out.  I was taken to a local hospital for observation and my sister was taken my helicopter.  The family in the truck was moving and a little boy holding a lamp was killed when it broke and punctured his neck.  That morning, my mom had to get a ride to work for my aunt because we were taking the van. She hadn’t slept well the night before because she woke up to the sound of chanting in the side of her room. She said it sounded like three voices all talking in unison saying take a floater and do it yourself. At first, she didn’t understand what the voices meant.  Her job had the option to work a weekend shift and a floater was if someone took a day off during the week and took on a weekend shift.  Hearing the voices scared her and she couldn’t really understand the meaning of what she was being told. When she wakes up the next day she feels sick to her stomach all day and has a massive migraine.  Around 4 o’clock she calls my aunt to come and pick her up from work because she can’t function any longer and her illness is worsening.  She calls my dad before she leaves her office and asks if we are home yet. When he tells her that we had not arrived she tells him he needs to leave now and go look for us.  As he pulls up to the highway, he notices that everything is blocked off and there were first responders everywhere.  He rushes up to the sheriff and tells him that it was his girls in the wreck.  They hadn’t identified us yet and we’re still working on the scene, so they turned him away.  A few minutes later the sheriff comes over and apologizes, telling my dad that it was us and giving him an update on our condition. It took my mom a long time to forgive herself for not understanding that message. If she would’ve taken a floater that day, she would not have been on the same highway that we had taken home from the bfs house.  The boy in the truck may have lived and my sister would not have spent three weeks in the ICU.  

My family always has weird stuff like this happen.  My mom was always very sensitive to things like this and so was her mom. I had a lot of creepy stuff happen when I was a kid and when my daughter was younger also. My daughter would become even more sensitive when she would spend time with my mom.

KeythKatz,"It's really difficult, because the sector is always evolving. One really requires a understanding of computer science (or at least software engineering), how the traditional financial structure operates, a working knowledge on the history of crypto as a whole, economics and game theory to operate at maximum effectiveness. There is no single knowledge base for this, you just kind of gain the intuition for it with experience and try to follow current trends the best you can, by participating in various discords.

I only got into DeFi in in Q4 2020 and learnt everything through being hands on and doing a lot of thinking about how the pieces fit together and how individual projects provide value.

To condense the basics of what I've learnt (but not everything), using only Ethereum examples: (Google any unknown terms)

(a) The ""base"" of DeFi starts from lending protocols. People have crypto, they want USD, but they also don't want to sell crypto as they believe the price will go up. This is where lending protocols like Compound and Aave come in, they give USD stablecoin holders a relatively risk-free return (because all lending is overcollateralised), while people with stacks of crypto get to borrow USD and take on liquidation risk.

(b) Having lots of different tokens is useless if you can't trade them for another token without going to a centralised exchange, because people want freedom. Decentralised Exchanges (dexs), Uniswap being the top dog, allow anyone to be market makers by being liquidity providers. They provide two tokens in stacks of equal value, to a liquidity pool (LP), and people trade into it by providing one token and taking out another. This is regulated by a constant product curve xy=k that allow swaps to be computationally cheap, and thus cheap to transact. Looking at the math, the more liquidity there is in a pool, the more volume can be traded for the same amount of price movement.

(c) Tokenising of projects. Projects like Sushiswap (Uniswap clone) realised they can attract value from competitors by simply giving out arbitrary tokens that are minted for free by the project, because anyone can create a ERC-20 token. Utility of the tokens range from useless (e.g. Stabilize, STBZ), to governance, meaning each token represents a vote, which may or may not be implemented as contracts (e.g. Uniswap, UNI), to actually earning a share of protocol fees as dividends (e.g. Harvest Finance, FARM). In the end though, the tokens basically derive value from how popular the projects they represent are and how many centralised exchanges they are listed on. Whether the tokens should actually be worth that much is up to you to decide.

(d) People realised that a lot of the tokens are inflated and useless, but because investing your money with a specific project can have huge payouts (thanks to (c)), you do it anyway and just dump the reward tokens. In comes the farming protocols. Projects like Harvest Finance basically help you farm and dump tokens to automatically compound your capital, the advantage being that you aren't spending $50 every day to do that. This lets people with little capital effectively put it to work, in exchange for a performance fee.

This is a simple model of the base layer-1 and layer-2 building blocks of DeFi. New developments happen all the time and fads come and go, e.g. algorithmic stablecoins, which was trendy from December to January, and currently NFTs. There is also a current trend of looking to non-Ethereum chains, but it's a chicken and egg problem. Nobody wants to leave Ethereum because all the apps and liquidity (b, very important) are there, and nobody wants to build on other chains because no users are there. So far, everything on the Binance Smart Chain, the current runner up L1 in DeFi, are just clones of existing Ethereum projects, and it's too early to tell whether it will be successful in the long run in attracting users, since there's almost no innovation occurring.",2021-03-29 00:05:39

TreeHugChamp,"NOTY, I will not blatantly take money from family while I am constantly tuning in my investment strategy. Based on my current models, I have been gaining 1200% per 6 months with 1% of my portfolio invested per ticker and using self hedged positions. Getting higher risk does not mean higher reward if you don’t know how to handle the higher risk. Building your portfolio isn’t always about having the biggest numbers, but the most consistent returns. If I continue doing what I’m doing, I’ll have more than that in relatively little time. I’m not trying to have an investment strategy blow up and owe family 7 figures.           

When it comes to high finance, I understand that not all funds are going to make quantitative leaps, but it doesn’t mean I can’t learn from professionals. I have learned from other people’s’ mistakes, other people’s successes, and now I would like to look for the same keys professionals look for. I personally would like to intern for a market maker so I could learn from them. People have different expectations of finance, but I feel that the more you learn and know the greater you can expect your returns.        

Did they tell you how to compare bid/ask to the technicals and watch for which broker is buying or selling stock while in school to better understand if support or resistance is likely to be broken at that time? Imo that is one of the more basic parts of investing that will greatly steepen a learning curve when watching t2 charts.       

Personally, I feel that my expectations of returns are grounded, but my dreams are grand. I feel that I have a better understanding of the fundamentals and what it takes to make money on a consistent basis.            

Mr PhD, before you try to berate someone else’s expectations for themselves, why not go through my post history?

I disagree with IQ not translating to the right end of the curve. You may be right, but I’ve yet to see it lose it’s correlation in multivariate regression models. In fact, I’d add initial income to the model to control for average or low IQ individuals who happen to already be wealthy, decreasing the relationship with IQ. This of course if we’re measuring earning potential.

My issue with IQ is it isn’t a great measure of intelligence. It focuses heavily on pattern recognition and a certainty type of problem solving. That isn’t to say that it isn’t a useable measure, just one that can’t strictly describe “intelligence”.

GoinGoinGon3,"Short answer: I think you got it covered. No one. Everyone will buy if the relative cost of owning vs renting goes down. Landlords need a new job. Nothing new. Abacus operators lost their jobs. Just gotta stop whining and innovate. 

Long answer:

Imagine a situation where house is 100k. Taxes are 12k if you are an investor and 0k if you are homeowner. Costs of renting are automatically 1k more per month. This 1k is either hitting the landlord which lowers supply of rentals or tenants which is lowering demand. Either way, you move towards owner occupancy and fewer rentals. Sucks for us but I really don't know if it would be that unpopular. As I pointed out Singapore does this and they have really high home ownership rates. 

Not everyone can afford 100k even if they want to stay put and don't mind sewer diving because it involves the downpayment or have credit access because of redlining and all this profit driven bullshit assholes in our industry do. 

So if renting costs that extra 1k monthly (if costs pass completely to tenant) but they can't afford the 20k downpayment, then they are stuck with the higher rentals as many correctly pointed out. 

As I was saying, it is a mix of outcomes. 

A homebuyer will outbid a landlord because his ownership costs are 12k lower. Make it PV with your favourite excel sheet... and put a nice sounding finance term on it. It will happen even if we don't like it. Or, a landlord in distress who can't collect rent can't deal with the higher taxes and wants to sell. No other landlord wants it, but OO with the 12k advantage can do cash for keys. It's that simple.

Which of these 2 effects are stronger... Not so clear. I answer questions like this for a living and it's really not that simple. I'd have to think hard. To answer it I won't have time to build and rent. All I know is regulations that hit us increase costs just like this 12k tax. It will simply drive landlords out of business. 

Rents go up, but only for a few. That fucking triangle in the supply demand curve gets small at the top after you take out deadweight loss. 

So my message to us is to stop being so simplistic about things. Rents go up, for few. Don't act as if we are the only folks capable of providing housing. If we do it jobs better than others, we keep our jobs if not we don't deserve it. 

If enough of us keep behaving like entitled whiny bitches instead of doing our jobs properly, we will get legislated out of existence because in case ya'll haven't noticed, we aren't that popular.",2021-04-03 03:10:33

NPRjunkieDC,"This applies to small and mid-cap too 

https://ragingbull.com/kb/how-to-make-money-with-penny-stocks/

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies. 

If you are using RH or WB that don't allow pennystocks there is a subreddit r/RobinHoodPennyStocks .
On NASDAQ many options like CTRM + SNDL + DGLY + HIMX + CIDM + NOK + ATOM+ ENG

If you want to be proactive there are a bunch of paid classes you can take like Training the Street or Wall Street Prep or equivalents to get ahead of the curve. You might be able to get student discounts through your university for those. 

I’m sure there are also tons of free resources on YouTube or Google if you take a look. 

Keep in mind that modeling isn’t the be all end all and in the end you’ll only be using a fraction of what these courses teach you (there are simplified versions of models that work better on the job).

Megahuts,"Here are my thoughts on Silver (and I have some way OTM calls on AG just in case my timing is wrong).

The past 2-3 years have been eerily similar to 2007-2008. Not enough for a perfect match, but enough to rhyme (yield curve inversion timing, liquidity issues, etc.)

Last time, the Fed took way too long to act. They didn't this time, and the additional fiscal stimulus is awesome as well.

However, based on the past 21 years, silver and gold have been cranking higher every time the Fed lowers rates (especially 2008 - 2011). So, just like ""last time"" I expect a spike in silver and gold prices at some point in the future. 

Note, it is possible (but unlikely) that funds flow into BTC, or NTF, instead.

For example, from a techical trading chart, gold has completed a cup over 8 years, and might be creating the handle to complete the pattern. Which is insanely bullish, should it complete and breakthrough on high volume. 

https://goldprice.org/gold-price-history.html

Silver's chart is not as nice, from a technical perspective.

How would you trade this?

Physical (or near physical PSLV).

Royalty (basically, not miners, but finance a copper mine and are paid in silver, can't recall the names) 

Miners (Barrick, First Majestic, etc)

Junior miners (on the TSX venture, I have NO idea which ones)

I did most of my reading in the 2011 - 2013 bull market in gold and silver, but didn't bother acting as it seemed played out.

I do plan to act, but I am tied up in Steel.

If they are still around, I will reactivate my sub to Casey's Research.

In terms of returns, juniors are basically your penny stocks, and can really deliver major returns. (similar to drug development clinical trial progression). This is where you would get your 10x to 1000x returns...or losses.

Miners and royalty are way better than physical (unless you want physical), as they are also leveraged to the price. Plus, they pay dividends.

So, as to how to play it, it is your call.

But I still think it is pretty early. (though there have been some significant option buys on SLV and GLD.)",2021-04-04 10:16:25
Prahasaurus,"A couple of points/questions.

1 - Do you think this will be a gradual squeeze, or something similar to a Black Friday event where the SEC or Justice drops the hammer on crypto in one major swoop? 

2 - If it's the hammer, what is the timing?  Don't you think this will take a lot of time to prepare, especially with a new Administration bogged down with other issues?

3 - When I talk to senior people around Finance, they seem to have no clue of crypto.  I mean, it's actually quite stunning.  Don't you think there will be a major learning curve before anything happens?  Right now they can't even spell DeFi. 

This is why in general I don't buy the government conspiracy to stop crypto, simply because they are so clueless.  That doesn't mean it won't change, but it's hard to play 3-d chess when you have no clue how the pieces even move.",2021-04-04 11:13:34

Wide-Fox-1076,"Similar NW. I’ve earned money through RE, growing a business, and investing in digital currency. Like you I appreciate simplicity. However given the current economic and political climate I believe you need to have multiple income streams in retirement to combat inflation. I believe owning stocks, bonds, real estate measured in usd right now isn’t a smart bet. Our true inflation rate for the next four years is 10-15%. A stock may seem like it performs well at 10%. But if it is measured in usd and our currency is being debased by more than that, what does that buy?  Everything you want to buy is getting more expensive. 

I would suggest holding onto some of your best real estate and handing it off to a good company to manage. This will provide good monthly cash flow with low risk and little to no work from you. Rents will rise but do note that these will lose some value over time from the usd currency devaluation going on. However I do think it is nice to have the income from the properties covering your living costs. It also smooths out curves from volatile markets in down turns. 

Next I truly believe in the next 12-18 months you will reliably be able to earn a good return off crypto currency. You can either hold it with a bank like fidelity and earn a yield or borrow money each year against your holding and use that to live off of. You do this to hold onto your crypto without selling it. I believe as the usd devalues alternative stores of value will rise, primarily over the next 3-4 years. I believe having a large position in Bitcoin specifically is a smart play. 

Lastly if you want to diversify read Ray Dalio’s recent paper about where he would invest money. I believe he said something like foreign markets non security risk assets blah blah. Not even sure what those are. Basically he is also saying avoid us stocks, bonds and real estate without trying to outright say Bitcoin. 

Whatever you decide $10m has a lot of buying power now, but probably not forever.  I personally don’t think buying a total stock market index will work anymore as the money printing curve is rising exponentially. Even high network effect stocks like Amazon and apple with struggle to keep up. You have nothing but time now to start listening to podcasts and videos about finance. Those will help you with your decision. And please no bonds!!",2021-04-05 03:32:50

A lot of protocols like Cream finance,  Curve, SushiSwap etc. have already deployed their contracts to the  Fantom Opera network so people who want to use these protocols don’t  have to pay the current gas fees on Eth.

PapaMurphy2000,"That applies if you buy a NEW boat. Which is probably the single dumbest thing one can do financially. And then finance it with a 20 year loan at 5 or 6%. DUMB DUMB DUMB!!

Boats depreciate crazy fast in the first few years and then flatline quickly. A well maintained boat can last 30 years easily. So to own a boat and not get killed buy a 5-10 year old boat that is already on the flatline of the depreciation curve. That means you can then sell it for more or less what you paid for it in the future. Your cost of ownership is then maintenance and storage.

I bought such a boat for $20K, 5 years ago. I could sell that boat for $25K today since the price of used boats skyrocketed last year during Covid. It costs me $3500 a year for moorage/storage and on average $1000 a year in maintenance, repairs and insurance. So call it $5K a year. To rent a boat like mine costs $500-700 a day. Plus the hassle of having to go rent it, fill out paperwork, etc, vs drive 10 minutes to the marina and jump on the boat. And I use it a lot more than 8-10 times a summer. I'm on that boat at least 3 days a week. Not for a full day. It's great to go out for a couple of hours in the evening, watch the sunset over the lake, or go to dinner on one of the lake restaurants.  I love owning my boat and if I ever sold it, that would not be a happy day.",2021-04-05 23:07:35

Also remember that Stern is in NYC and everyone is willing to speak with a Sternie, so your opportunities are endless.

theaman1515,"The BA and BS are very different, BS is much more Quant focused, so thats an important consideration.

Econ at UMD is pretty solid, however it's definitely not a ""walk-in-the-park"" like it is at some other schools. Many of the 300 and 400 level econs are graded incredibly harshly and you have to put in a lot of work to keep up. I saw final class averages in 305 and 306 (both required for BA) that were ~70%, meaning almost half of the student's had to retake. Likewise, I had many times where the average grade on a final or midterm was &lt;50%, but they do curve that. At many schools Econ is almost treated as the degree that you fall into if you don't get into the business school, but at UMD it is significantly more difficult than any of the business degrees. The only issue here is that you're often competing with many of the Smith school kids when applying to jobs, and your ECON GPA is likely going to be a good bit lower than the average Finance/Accounting/Management student's, so if the company doesn't really value that econ background you'll find it difficult to compete.

With all of that said, I loved my Econ degree and am still incredibly passionate about the subject. Its a great degree of you want to double major with another social science as well.

spartyfan1,"I'll drop my 2 cents here. (8 years in global procurement with an education in supply chain). 

First question: What is your long term goal? Why do you want to be good at many different functions/fields of a company? 

The issue you will run into by moving to another function is that you will have to start over again. Moving from procurement to finance? There will be a a learning curve due to different KPI's AND most importantly the different definition of spend between the two functions. 

Procurement is a field that will be growing fast over the next few years especially when it comes to big data. The systems and processes are antiquated and the entire globe is trying to figure out how to modernize it. Some companies haven't even tapped into the power of RFID tags to track material movement! What about the power of block chain? Advanced data analytics? ML/AI in predicting future disasters to adjust decision making. 

Procurement covers a very important aspect of business operations. Specifically managing 1) the cost of goods sold and 2) supplier relationships (in case of covid will your suppliers help you) and 3) most importantly supply chain risk. In your global role, YOUR understanding of your suppliers and supply market is what will make or break your company. It is always never seen as important but you know who is called on when shit like covid hits the fan? You are my friend hahaha.

To answer your question: Will you be stuck in procurment if you continue down the path? Most likely. But you can pivot into sooo many areas of the new world of procurement (Check out Merck's new procurement process that uses AI to predict world disasters to mitigate risk, or Haier's real time feedback flow from customer issues to procurement without having to wait for engineer reviews, or even how blockchain can provide material flow/quality issue/supplier management possibilities that sound futuristic).

That was quite a rant, but hope it was coherent....",2021-04-06 21:49:45
LDRH123,"A few things. Performance/affiliate marketing, ecommerce, a small SaaS business. I think the biggest key was that I started young enough to 1) be ahead of the curve and 2) have plenty of time for experimentation/failure/ability to quit completely if it didn't work. You literally cannot do entrepreneurship well if you lock yourself into an expensive lifestyle, which is tough to avoid when you spend a decade in finance. If you're grinding your ass off, what's the point if you can't enjoy it?

holyoak,"&gt; and there isn't even one. ONE! that has hung around for a long time and actually gained against bitcoin in all that time.

The entire top 100 has gained against BTC.

BTC had not gained wide acceptance; we are still very early in the curve.  Many problems (such as high fees, blockchain transparency, slow confirmations, centralized miners) still need to be overcome before BTC can see mass adoption.

Then there is the simpler argument against maximalism; people use, and always have used, different types of money.  Hopefully you have change in your pocket, a 401k, and a credit card.  These are all money, but in functionally different forms that are implemented based on specific use cases.  To say that BTC is going to dominate **all** use cases is naive in terms of history.

Your focus on 'flippening' indicates an all or nothing viewpoint.  The world, especially finance, is much more about shades of grey than black and white. Several tokens will gain major ground against BTC in the future, the trick is picking the correct ones in a sea of crap.",2021-04-07 01:44:25

Feisty-Lake-Bass,"&gt; I've been feeling concerned as to whether at my age, I'm not earning enough and may struggle in the future.

As much as people will say ""comparison is the thief of joy"", the reality is that if you want to own a house, you need to be doing a certain level of well. 

&gt; I've been working since January so I'm still starting out new. 

Salary curves are different in different industries. For CPAs, the curve is rather steep. You are actually earning more than an lot of new grad accountants would be at a Big 4. 

&gt; I am worried I'm not doing well and that I have nothing to be proud of.

Too early to say. Your story has yet to be written here. 

&gt; but is it even enough compared to those in Southern Ontario? Housing market seems impossible for me to even consider in the future, considering investing in property takes a lot of money, and so many other COL things to consider when i do eventually move out.

An increasingly important part of buying property is a similar income partner.

Currently? No, but you are in a career where with a partner you will earn enough. You are 23. CPA/finance salaries rise quite a bit.

romeotangoxray,"There is a sweet spot for the price level of FIL, where miners are still able to earn a decent ROI quickly enough, without having to tie up unreasonable amounts of cash for years at a time, due to the staking requirements for each TB of storage.

Read up on the history of how Protocol Labs had to change the vesting schedule for rewards, to allow a larger percentage to be cashed out earlier. Otherwise, a substantial number of miners would not have had sufficient financing to fully deploy their capabilities, without risk of running out of cash before vesting enough to pay back their loans.

I picked out $40/FIL because that's where the introductory price level was at back when mining was still accessible to smaller operators - without having to obtain large loans to finance the staking requirements.

If FIL were to stay on a parabolic growth curve, and reach $1,000+/coin, how is that healthy for the long-term addition of more miners?

Is the goal here to just speculate and drive up the price of the coin indefinitely?

proverbialbunny,"&gt;Low Volatility Anomaly:
&gt;
&gt;The observation that low volatility stocks have higher returns than high volatility stocks in most markets studies. This is an example of a stock market anomaly since it contradicts the usual prediction that higher risk always equals higher returns. 

This is not true.  The first study it uses as a source cherry picks data and the second study states, ""One commonly heard concern with low-risk investing is that the sizable assets in dedicated low-risk ETFs nowadays may imply that the anomaly is rapidly being arbitraged away.""

What is this anomaly?  That investing in non-tech stocks from 1990 to 2002, which were lower volatility, made more during this time.

In finance classes once of the first things you're taught is called portfolio management.  Within that is a gem called portfolio theory.  Here is a link to a MIT lecture about the topic, if curious: https://youtu.be/8TJQhQ2GZ0Y

To summarize the topic, there is an efficiency curve when picking a stock or etf.  This curve says what the max profit you can receive in a time frame given how much volatility it experiences.  The more volatile (which means larger up and down movement) the more potential for a max profit. 

Some sectors have medium-high volatility but only medium returns, eg REITs and therefore are generally not considered an ideal buy, as you're adding unnecessary volatility to your portfolio and getting nothing of it.  

One of the consistent highest performers in gains to volatility out there is VOO, which is why it may be the \#1 invested ETF in the world.  VOO would make 9-11% annually for the last 100 years, if it went back that far.  The last decade has been especially generous averaging 14-16% returns.  On the volatility side at the bottom of a recession it regularly bottoms out at about 45% from top, sometimes hitting 50% in an extreme case.  

Can someone make more than VOO?  Absolutely but at the cost of more volatility, and how much more volatility determines how worthwhile it is of a buy.  You can buy ETFs that lose up to 90% during a dip, let alone a recession, but as you can guess they make a ton more than VOO.  Is this a good idea?  Probably not, as most people can not stomach those kinds of losses and will end up selling low.  

Likewise in the other direction you can have reduced volatility and reduced profits.  Again, the trick is to find the edge of the curve so you're maximizing profit per volatility.  Going back to REITs, they make less than VOO but their volatility is also lower than VOO but only by a little bit.  One of the reasons VOO is so popular is it's hard to find ETFs that make less and have proportional volatility.  Most low volatility funds significantly under perform when it comes to profits.  Eg, investing in a world-wide emerging markets ETF.  You will make less, and your volatility will be less, but you're not at the end of the curve maximizing profit per volatility.  Even gold's volatility is too high given how much it makes.

In fact, if anyone here can find an ETF that under performs VOO, by a reasonable bit, not flat lines, but has volatility not in excess, I'd be rather impressed.  It's not easy to find a high performing low volatility ETF and for good reason, this article is bull.

So, say VOO is too volatile for you, so you want to reduce volatility but maximize profits in relation to that volatility.  What do you do?  Do you buy a lower volatility ETF with lower profits, even if it has higher volatility in relation to profits?  No.  Instead, you only hold a percent of your holdings in VOO.  If you hold 66% in VOO you have 1/3rd less volatility but 1/3rd less profits.  You can also diversify, but a dirty little secret today is most ETFs all over the world line up with VOO.  If VOO goes down so do they so you're not reducing volatility.  You have to find what is called a low ß (beta) ETF to properly diversify.",2021-04-14 13:37:04
mctheebs,"&gt;""What was your wage when you were toiling away gutting fish or using a crosscut saw and axe? What year was it when you were earning that wage?"" I was making $100 a week cutting trees: averaged about $2 an hour. Pretty good pay at the time in 1966 for a 20 year old. In 1964 I worked a fishing boat out of Port-aux-basque. I averaged $300 a voyage, about $50-70 a week.

So at 20 years old in 1966 you were earning $817.52 in today's money ([calculated using this calculator](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/)). The median wage a 20-24 year old earns today is [$640.00 a week](https://smartasset.com/retirement/the-average-salary-by-age). So you were making about 30% more than the average 20 year old earns today. Moreover, things have gotten more expensive in that time,[ so the average wage actually buys *less* today than it does in 1966.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/) 

Now you might be thinking ""well, workers need to *work* more if they want to get paid more."" Well, workers are actually [*far more* productive than they are today than they were in 1966, but are seeing a smaller and smaller cut of the profits they are generating for their employers](https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/). This is because a larger and larger share of the profits have gone to [skyrocketing executive compensation instead of the average worker.](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/20/how-much-money-ceos-have-earned-over-the-years.html)

&gt; How old were you when you bought your first house? I was 40 when I bought my first house: paid cash.

&gt; How much did that first house cost? $69,950 (plus all the taxes &amp; add ons)

[So the average age of firstime homeowners 34 years old](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/research/average-age-to-buy-a-house/), so you were actually behind the curve buying your first house at 40. However, you also did not mortgage your home and instead bought it with cash, which is very much not the norm in 2021. In fact, people who are in the 40-55 year old range actually have the largest amount of mortgage debt, averaging at $247,564, which is $40,000 than the national average.

Your first house cost $69,950 in 1985 dollars, which is only $172,194.67 in 2021 dollars. [The average price of a house in 2021 is $408,800.00](https://www.statista.com/statistics/240991/average-sales-prices-of-new-homes-sold-in-the-us/#:~:text=After%20plateauing%20between%202017%20and,it%20reached%20408%2C800%20U.S.%20dollars.). Of course, averages are skewed by the highest and lowest prices on the market, so let's check the median.[ The median price of houses leading up to 2021 was $340,000](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/real-estate/housing-trends), still substantially higher than the price you paid for your house in 2021 dollars.

&gt;What was the interest rate offered on your first savings account? I was 6 years old, and my mother set it up, but I'll guess it was around 1.5-1.7 percent.

1.5% is a great interest rate for a saving account. [The average savings account interest rate in 2021 is a princely .04%](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/average-savings-account-interest-rate#:~:text=The%20average%20savings%20account%20in,to%20data%20from%20the%20FDIC.)

So you grew up in a time where wages were higher, consumer goods were cheaper, where workers got a larger percentage of the profits they were generating for their employers, where big ticket items like houses were *significantly* cheaper, and where savings accounts actually offered a decent amount of interest.

Do you understand now how your view of things is a little naive considering your frame of reference was vastly different in terms of how much things cost and how much people were compensated for their labor? In 2021, you can't just stick your money in a savings account and rack up the compound interest because the interest afforded is a laughablely insulting pittance. 

This doesn't even touch on how things have changed socially. That is, discrimination on the basis of sex and race was very much a thing in the mid-20th century and that had a giant effect in shaping the job market and what opportunities were afford to whom.",2021-04-14 23:08:01

I used the Schweser videos as my main study tool, complemented with Schweser written notes when I didn't understand something. I found Schweser's video teachers excellent. While watching a video (I only watched them once, but I watched them well -- a one hour video would take me about 3-4 hours to go through) I would write down on white blank sheets everything of importance that the teacher said.

I would use one sheet per module, with 50-something modules in all. On occasion the Schweser videos were missing some part of the curriculum (maybe 5% in all). At the end of a video I would scan the Schweser books to see if anything was missing from the video. If there was, I would add that part to my notes. After having studied a module for the first time, I would do the standard Schweser questions, then move on. I almost always scored 90±3% on these quizzes, when I took them immediately after seeing the video and writing my notes.

&amp;#x200B;

Just some articles I came across tonight outlining the supply constraints large auto manufacturers are dealing with due to their short-sightedness.

I'm trying to change how you think about this situation, rather than convince you that you're wrong. Think of what is happening:

* [Consumer demand statistics](https://www.cjponyparts.com/resources/mustang-sales-throughout-years) do not support the argument that there has been an expansion of demand for mustangs.
* Supply constraints will lead to a contraction of the supply curve. This is based on the [Law of Supply](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/supply-demand-equilibrium/supply-curve-tutorial/a/law-of-supply). In fact, how about you click [this link](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/supply-demand-equilibrium/supply-curve-tutorial/a/what-factors-change-supply) and work your way through factors that affect supply curves. There is even an example question that is perfectly relevant. It discusses the price of steel and its impact on the cost of production of vehicles. This can be applied using the supplied articles. Instead of steel, it is semiconductors.

This is a teaching moment, so don't read this thinking, ""fuck it, I'll just say told ya so in a year."" Interpret it and try to understand the start to finish of the data.

Furthermore, if you are not well versed in supply/demand, the point about the supply curve here is that equilibrium prices are found in the real world when the demand curve intersects the supply curve. So that's what I am trying to say. The price is going to increase because of the supply shortage. This doesn't even consider the supply shortage of other raw materials.

Once supply picks back up to meet consumer demand, the prices will come down. Not sure if the used car market is going to have an enormous influx of mustangs coming back in to downgrade/upgrade, but if that happens, the cost of mustangs will indeed go down. You would then get to say you were indirectly correct. So it's not about being right or wrong, it's about understanding why the price movements occur. Eventually both of us will be right in the long run.... However, I'm still of the opinion that the fiscal stimulus and expansive monetary policy will put upwards pressure on these assets in general, independent from supply/demand factors.",2021-04-15 14:24:17
MachineTeaching,"Well, sort of, but not really.

Taxes discourage whatever they tax, consumption taxes like a sales tax reduce consumption, taxes on labor income reduce the labor supply, etc.

So yes, broad cuts to for example labor income can help stimulate the economy.

But it's important to keep other factors in mind. For example, higher incomes lead to a lower marginal propensity to consume. This basically means that a comparable tax cut for someone rich does relatively less than the same tax cut for someone poor as far as consumption is concerned.

Trickle down economics isn't really a theory but rather policy proposals that say we should cut taxes on the rich and businesses. This isn't the same as broad tax cuts for ""everyone"".

It also carries other implications. The [laffer curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laffercurve.asp) for example. In practice, we're usually ""ahead"" of the peak of the laffer curve, meaning tax cuts *don't* increase revenue.

And of course the trouble is that taxes finance things. Sure, lower taxes is ""better"", very broadly speaking. But if we take those taxes and spend them on things that improve the economy, that picture suddenly changes. And generally, government spending leads to *higher* growth. So less taxes, less spending, less growth.

We also don't see tax cuts for the rich improving the economy in practice. They lead to higher inequality, which causes its own issues, and the extra money also just get transferred to tax havens, so there really isn't much *to* trickle down, even if trickle down would work otherwise.

Tax cuts have other issues if we're talking about tools to help during recessions. Taxes are generally slow to change and hard to raise, cutting taxes during downturns and raising them during booms is just not very politically feasible. That's why governments rather increase spending for example.",2021-04-15 18:29:20

anonuman,"This is called ""buying on contract"" and can be a GREAT way to purchase an asset (home, business, property, etc).  STRONGLY disagree with u/freevoodoo that this is necessarily a scam, and very much agree with u/Particular-Earth-453 that the legal lay out is critical.

Traditional lenders (banks) are said to ""only lend money when you don't need it"".  Having the seller finance the deal is an alternative.  This can be mutually beneficial to both the buyer and the seller.  The seller gets several benefits:  buyer incentivized to take better care of the property, buyer has higher incentive to maintain payments, and seller has collateral if the buyer defaults with a relatively low cost to recover (compared to the bank).

The buyer gets several benefits: low cost of entry to home ownership, option to buy out at any time, limited exposure to decreasing values.

If the value of the property was agreed at $100,000, and the seller offered to sell on contract, a deal might look like $2,500 upfront, $1,200/month for rent/insurance, $100 month to maintain the contract.  This is basically first month, last month, and $1,200/year to maintain the right to buy out.

Typical reasons for using a seller's contract vs traditional bank financing would be that the property is distressed (and the bank will not finance until repairs are made), that the property will not appraise (atypical architecture, remote with lack of comps, etc), or that the buyer has poor credit.  All of these have a high probability of resolving within a couple a few years, allowing the buyer to buy out the contract with traditional lending.

Negotiation points to watch for:  up front fee is the most obvious, but can be mitigated with negotiated terms that allow for the fee (or a portion) to roll in to the purchase at the buy out.  For example, a buyer wants to buy 20 acres for their horses.  There is no structure and the buyer is willing to add fences.  Value of $100,000 is defined as prohibitive, so buyer and seller create a contract.  Seller asks for $20,000 up front fee.  Ouch!  BUT buyer negotiates that $19,000 goes to purchase when contract is bought out.  Depends on the buyer and the seller.

The other point is period or term of the agreement.  Be careful about mandatory termination within a few years.  Markets fluctuate and cash flow always has the opportunity to make life challenging,  A longer term allows for more options and more ability to manage life's curve balls.

Seller's get a bad rep and are accused of ""predatory"" practices when they take a property back per the terms of the contract.  This is certainly a potential outcome, and none of the protections of a federally backed loan are in place, but a contract written and reviewed by an attorney should mitigate this.  

The biggest threat to this arrangement is the buyer's optimism.  ""I can fix that distressed house and have it ready to refi in 3 months, so a 1 year term is fine."". Or ""I can get my debt under control and my credit score from 550 to 700 in 2 years, so a 2 year term is fine."".  Both of these put the buyer in a pressure cooker.  The only way this kind of deal, properly executed and negotiated, can fail is if the buyer allows it to.",2021-04-16 00:01:14
littlepuccini,"Banks/finance aren't as glamourous as industrial capital, because they don't work directly with workers and products, but it is the largest sector and it is growing fast as a result of capital concentration and imperialism. Amazon is a monopoly retailer -- in 2019, the entire retail sector contributed [about 25% as much to US GDP](https://www.bts.gov/content/contributions-us-gross-domestic-product-gdp-selected-industries-billions-current-dollars) as finance/real estate. While retail, construction, and manufacturing roughly doubled from 1997 to 2019, finance and business services tripled.

You should never underestimate the power of the banks. Socialists tend to focus on strikes and unions, fighting the front-line employers, but remember that every increase in profitability is an increase that the banks benefit from as much as any other capitalist. For example, the war machine is a great mechanism for taking taxpayer money and diverting it to US capitalists in the ""defense"" industry but the banks also take their healthy cut, both through loans and partial ownership of the war industries, and by lending the state the money they spend on the war.

There is also another point which didn't apply in Lenin's day but is very relevant today: in a modern capitalist economy with fiat currency, the main means by which the money supply can expand to match production (to prevent deflation and crisis) is through bank loans, with the expansion being governed by each country's central bank. So economic growth requires increased debt, which requires more economic growth to pay the interest on, and so on. This means that there can never be an advanced capitalist country, save for one which brings in a common currency from abroad (like the individual Eurozone countries, and they have their own significant problems), which  is not heavily reliant on the banks to run their economy.

Not to mention that the central bank, like any other apparatus of the bourgeois state, often operates on the principle of increasing profits instead of their stated role of controlling inflation. For example, take a look at [this letter](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/2011-08-05-letter-from-trichet-and-fernandez-ordonez-to-zapateroen.pdf) from the ECB to the government of Spain during the debt crisis (similar ones were likely sent to Greece, Italy, Portugal, etc.), which demands an end to inflation-indexing of wages, not to control inflation (which is not a major issue given the small size of Spain compared to the European Common Market), but to stop them from being an ""obstacle to the adjustment of labour costs"" and ""hampering competitiveness"", banker-speak for lowering profits for investors. Or look at the American Fed's policy of combatting ""overheating"" (defined as any sustained increase in labour share) by raising interest rates to cause some deflation and unemployment and bring the labour share back down. In recent decades, the Phillips curve (the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment) has flattened in the United States, meaning their old excuse (of maintaining unemployment and restricting wage share to prevent inflation) is useless; but instead of reevaluating their policy, they have just come up with a new term to justify the same thing: using monetary policy to maintain profits.",2021-04-16 06:04:24

CGApe,"This is definitely not a dumb question, it's good to know what you're getting into before diving in head first.

&gt; I suppose I need to have a good knowledge of finance and trading other than programming skills to be good at algo trading, so where can I start learn?

**Your ideas will be generated mostly based on fundamental concepts in finance and trading**, so knowledge is required. This can be something basic like ""When people see stocks moving up, they pile in and buy, so they continue moving up"" (e.g. dogecoin). This is one of the most basic strategies people use called momentum, it works well in some markets. The opposite of this could be a mean reverting strategy. You could reason that a stock, bond, crypto, or other asset has some ""fair value"" and strong moves up or down in the short term are likely to revert at some point. (there is also a more advanced variant of this called a pairs trade, which is worth looking into)

Unfortunately programming knowhow alone will not help you. Code is just how you test and automate you strategy. There is an approach to idea generation called data mining, where coding skill will help you, but data mining has mixed results. Often times you end up finding some correlation or pattern that is just pure coincidence and will not persist.

You should also have basic trading ""street smarts"". Knowing different about order types, how leverage affects returns, what kinds of fees/taxes you are paying on each trade, etc, is important.

&gt; I tried to build some programs to follow some basic strategies, but with no results.

&gt; Have I to learn TA?

Most TA is complete bullshit. Not all, but most. With that being said, the strategy I trade with my own money would be considered technical, since it only uses price data as an input.

&gt; In your experience, is it a profitable sector? Or it's only good to get hired from a multinational to develop code for them? Do some of u are living with algo trading?

Don't be delusional about profits. The world's best money managers and hedege funds make about 20% per year over long periods of time. Cryptos have more volatility, so higher returns are to be expected, but I would still say that living off of an algo is a unlikely at best.

This next part is boring but important. Understanding the math behind compounding interest is key. My advice would be not to quit your day job, and insted work on algotrading on the side. Since you are not withdrawing any money from your bot, your returns will grow exponentially and you will be super rich in no time. Given the above example of 20% p.a. returns, you would double your money every 4 years.

&gt; Since I have no experience in finance world, but (I think) I have a good coding experience, how many months/years, in your opinion, can I be confident with algo trading and all the environment around this?

As I said before, coding is just about testing and automation. I would say that a year of casual studing of finance is enough to get over the overconfidence hump of the dunning-kruger curve. There are some great resources online. Check out some of the videos on the quantopian youtube channel. (RIP quantopian)

&gt; A saw a lot of strategies out there, I imagine that if them are public so are not profitable.. Am I wrong?

There are some ""open secret"" strategies that seem to keep working year after year. Something like trend following is an example of this. But most silver bullet trading systems are very flawed. Most anything you find online that goes something like ""buy 10 contracts when EMA A crosses EMA B and set a stoploss 50 points below your 
entry"", will not work very well. There might be some underlying concepts in there that are good, but things like position size need to be figured out based on things like 
historical volatilty, liquidity, and your personal risk tolerance.

If someone is trying to sell you a premade bot or strategy, it is most likely a scam.

&gt; Have I to study different things if I want to trade Cryptos or normal FIATS? Is crypto world profitable or it's too unpredictable for algo trading?

You need to learn the different properties of different markets. E.g. ""stocks tend to go up over the long term because the underlying companies are generating money"", or ""oil tends to be a mean reverting asset due to the balance of supply and demand"". This will help with idea generation.

Cryptos are a fun playground for algotrading. Low fees, liquid markets, plenty of assets to trade. I don't see anything wrong with starting out in cryptos and branching out.


Some general things I wish I knew when I started algo trading:

- **Trade slower rather than faster**. Fees are a bitch.

- **Diversification is a free lunch.** If your algo works well with BTC/USD, then it will probaly also work well with ETH/USD. This way you get the same profits, but less risk. The more assets you are trading the better.

- **Backtests can be deceiving.** There is too much to mention here, just know that backtests lie.

- **If it's too good to be true, it is.** See above.


I hope this helps. Algotrading is definitely worth getting into. Even if you don't make any money (or more likely, lose money), you will learn a lot and have a good time.",2021-04-17 06:09:10
UnderGroundNinja2020,"Thank you this is what I waa after.  So I def consider my self a newbie but have enough understanding to use uniswap and stuff. I had no idea regarding the pools and not enough liquidity for executing the cross chain swaps.

Is there a different protocol that I can use to swap cross chain while avoiding centralized exchanges? I don't think there is much to my understanding,  I thought thorchain was the first of its kind,  erik Voorhees is how I found thor and he seems to think he will be huge....the price on rune has almost 3x in the last weeks which doesn't make sense if doesn't allow users to do its thing?

I'd prefer to not have to wrap my btc in order to make btc swaps... hence why I was hoping to use thor chain. I dont love thor chain it just appears to be the only one that you can swap decentralized without wrapping,  but apparently you can't actually do that just yet bc of the pools /funds issue you speak of.

Also unrelated new question, do you have insights on where or how I could get enough knowledge on using protocols like compound, curve in order to provide liquidity or other strategies to earn a % for passive income ?

I was trying to read up on yearn finance but it's complicated.

Shatter_Hand,"Central banks are already researching stablecoins or “digital fiat”. Instead of a paper USD or paper British Pound, it’ll simply be a digital version. Think of an email bank statement instead of one sent to you by the post office. It’s far more cost efficient, environmentally friendly, auditable, and serviceable. 

Every country’s central bank sets their own interest rate. This rate is the rate banks borrow the money at. The money they borrow is lent into existence, and they in turn lend it to you for a business, a credit card, home, or car loan. They lend to everybody from individuals to hedge funds. DeFi is cutting that middle-man out. You are becoming the bank. 

Right now, DeFi has too much friction. We’ll define friction as: the number of steps to complete something. That will fall. Consider the friction of video streaming for example when it began in ~1996. You needed to have:

 - to own a 56k modem
 - to download a tcp/icp client
 - to download a media player
 - to find the website
 - to add batch files

The more friction, the higher the learning curve. Fast-forward to today, and everyone carries a dozen video streaming options with them in their pocket, assuming there’s a smart phone there. Two-year-old children literally know how to use it. DeFi is unusable for the masses right now, consider borrowing stablecoins currently:

There are no central bank stablecoins (besides China’s digital Yuan). There are middle men (USDC, Tether, etc) that hold fiat currency in reserves. The interest rate to borrow them against your collateral (your crypto) is ~9%. That’s too high. There’s a huge incentive for legacy finance to capture those profits and this market entirely, which they will, and are currently researching. If they don’t, then the first movers (China and their Yuan for example) are going to become far too powerful. It’s a necessity actually. 

So from here, you avoid the capital gains, hold your deflationary crypto, profit from the borrowing arbitrage, and buy like you normally would.

In February I bought a car for my wife (late Christmas gift) and borrowed stablecoins against my Ethereum collateral at 8.5% interest. It’s staked, so the staking rewards essentially offset the borrowed interest in this case. The car I bought from a dealer in Florida who accepted USDC as payment. It was a great decision, because Ethereum (my collateral) doubled, I avoided taxes and paid off the car, which ended up being free",2021-04-17 13:54:05
ausernamez001,"Hello, for fidelity, log into the site and type into the search box ""real time"".  This will lead you to an electronic agreement/form to full out which will give you live real time pricing.  It's free to do that, just gotta submit the electronic agreement/form.

Having real time quotes and charts is very useful for entry and exit.

Fidelity mobile app is lackluster in the charting aspect, so I would use a different app for charts, one that allows you to use indicators such as volume, rsi, vwap, etc.

I have etrade and fidelity.  Etrade charges commission on some things, but I like the layout and the charting works.  You can add 2 or 3 indicators on etrade charts.  There may be a funding requirement, I don't know as I had already had 30k of miscellaneous positions and set it up years ago.  Your mileage may vary.  

Td Ameritrade has their charting app that is called Think Or Swim.  The charts are advanced, many indicators can be added, and fill out same real time agreement on their site to activate real time quotes.
You can make an account on TD Ameritrade and just do not add funds, which allows you to utilize Think Or Swim.  It is somewhat advanced charting and there is a little learning curve, but if you set it up the way you want and save the workspace it will stay as you configured it (indicators, time frames etc) for each time you open the application again.  I use it on PC, haven't messed with the mobile app too much.

You going to need to.experiment a bit and get your stuff setup beforehand so you can just open the application and quickly check how the stock is moving.  There is a learning curve.

These are how you can follow the stock.movement and see what's happening in real time.  Yahoo has a slight delay from realtime, but it works halfway decent and gets the job done, so you could use yahoo finance page to get a view of movement and volume etc and then check fidelity app or ToS or etrade to see the actual real-time data.

If this squeezes, I don't think you will miss it, but you will want real time data to ensure you are looking at actual live activity and not delayed data.

Honestly, you just need to give yourself a crash course and learn by doing.  Play with the apps, see how they work, get your ducks in a row so you can access everything quickly and on the fly (because you said you check between meetings).

* I'd probably have to work over the summer/cannot take unpaid internships
* Really big (though there are way less students in Ross, so I'm not too concerned about class size?)
* Way less diverse: worried about finding an Asian community

psstein,"&gt;What can one do with a MA in history?

Quite a number of things. I work for a large consulting firm. It's really how you market what you can do and what your skills look like. Two of my major MA papers were on the implementation and development of medical technology and hospital system response to pandemic disease. 

&gt;Are there any good combinations to go with a MA in history to make one more marketable either in or out of academia? 

Finance, accounting, data analytics (if you want to leave academia). If you want to stay in: sociology, anthropology, economics

&gt;Have things changed in American academia in the past 2-3 years? Are things on the up and up or has COVID sent the job market spirally down even more than it was before?

The market has been in real trouble since 2008. COVID has simply dealt the death blow to an already fragile market. There have been a grand total of 4 European history jobs posted this entire year. 4. For a considerably sized field. The job market has gotten considerably worse over the last few years. Consistently, there are more PhDs graduating than there are available jobs. 

&gt; Lastly, do any of you have any other guidance or advice for a person like myself in this situation?

Don't go. If you must go, go to a top 10 PhD program (think: Ivy or equivalent, like Chicago or Berkeley). Anything else will put you so far behind the curve that it's not worth bothering with the necessary time to get a PhD. 

Your initial instincts were right, frankly. The history profession is dying, partly due to university admin choices, partly due to choices of the professional field. The market, which was bad when I went to grad school in 2017, is much worse now.",2021-04-18 13:49:35

Jimmykaner1979,"I think and obviously dont hold me to it but I believe that based on everything in the CURRENT market it will exceed $0.50 a share by end of year.  

However, if the overall Economy does not recover from Covid and job creation does not increase it could hold back OMI

Here is the way i see it :

Veve, if it takes off correctly with current management and licensing and the AP starts to be able to perform with added users will be ahead of the curve in the NFT Collectible game.   

The fact that the end product is geared towards younger tech savy kids for the most part will make it in a sense a addictive behavior in the collectible world that kids will dump money into.  

From a technical view obviously the $0.007 range seems to really be the support level for a entry point to buy more.      

Crypto has been in a major bull run the past year and the past weeks selloff could just be some profit taking and I do believe that we will see higher levels set shortly.   

Keep in mind I am not a crypto whiz.  My background is Accounting/Finance in at good NY University and i traded Junk Bonds on a institutional level on Wall Street btwn major banks, hedge funds and asset managers.   

The news that Brevan Howard Asset Management who manages $40bln AUM is entering Crypto says something about the world of speculation to me in a massive way.",2021-04-19 10:28:17
heyheeyheeey,"I've asked before, but still can't make up my mind.    
    
I'm starting to prepare for when the time for taking some profits comes. I'm not planning to sell ETH for FIAT, but for yield-generating stablecoins. The biggest doubt is as in what strategy to follow.

- AAVE/Compound lending.    
- Yearn Vaults.    
- Curve Pools.

JPTrader604,There’s an indirect curve since only 40-45% can pass. Also: finance requires way more skills than just a cfa nowadays. We can’t “read from a textbook” and beat the market. Hence we gotta learn outside the books.,2021-04-19 22:21:26
SRTHRTHDFGSEFHE,"For the past months i’ve been trying my best to do exactly what the government doesn’t want me to do with my stimulus checks: make them grow. Use them as a tool to break free of the day-in, day-out grind to make rent that has been my existence for far too long. Depression, addiction, loneliness, hopelessness, the list goes on. I know them all too well. But. COVID happened. I was given the gift of free time and free money. I got sober and healthy. Then the whole GameStop thing happened. I think that was a spark for many people. I made a little money in that event, but more importantly, I realized that I could make money in the market, and that it’s all a game, truly. That shift in my thinking about money in general was a revolution for me, figuring out how to play the money game became fun. Like a puzzle. Fast-forward a few months to now: I’ve been in the markets everyday, reading books on finance every day, obsessed, determined to make this happen. I made some money and lost some money. I’ve made good investments and bad investments, but I’ve learned so much in the process. One thing I know now: we can break the pattern that we’re all dying to get out of. It’s possible. I also know now that we, the human race, is on the brink of a financial revolution, if we’re not already in one. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain tech in general is going to radically change the way people do things- everything- and soon. Some of you might know way more than I do, and I apologize for the wall of text. Anyway- just to wrap this up: SafeMoon is the golden ticket in my mind. It’s a brand new, super cheap token that is just EXPLODING. It’s kind of like a 401k on steroids in that it pays you to hold onto it. I’ve gotten my whole family and all of my close friends on board. We’re all up at least 10%, and it’s only. just. beginning. rule #1: never risk more than you can lose. Rule #2 do your own research. Rule #3 don’t panic sell. Crypto is extremely volatile and you need to emotionally prepare yourself for that. Don’t act in fear. If you feel confident in an investment, don’t sell at a loss. Diamond hands. Head over to r/Safemoon, the Discord server, and Safemoon.net for info. P.s. There are plenty of other coins too, I just think that Safemoon is literally a once in a lifetime, life changing opportunity. No hyperbole. It’s too good to be true, but it’s true anyway. There’s no catch. I’m confident that I’ve figured out how to live the life I’ve always dreamed of, but never thought was possible. Teach yourself and your loved ones about crypto because now is the time to get ahead of the curve. Good luck to you all!

stylewithcoffee,"I'm a Junior w/ a cumulative 3.75 @ LUC (HS: 3.83), double-majoring in Finance/Economics, minor in Theology. The most succinct advice I can give is just to not do what a lot of Freshman do:

1. Don't spend your free time going crazy w/ parties and such. Socialization is important and healthy, but some weeks/weekends you'll have to sacrifice that to do really well.
2. Don't try to do too much. Joining a ton of extracurriculars right off the bat can easily be overwhelming. Dip your toes in the water w/ a few ECs that genuinely interest you; you can always join more later.
3. Don't get cocky. Some classes you can glide through and get an A, some you can't; often, it's hard to tell a class's overall difficulty curve early on. It's better to be on top of things in the beginning and you can relax later if it ends up being an easy ride.
4. Don't skip class (excessively). I've skipped plenty of times, Zoom and in-person, but you need to be smart about when you do it and making a habit of doing it often will not serve you well when you get to tougher classes.
5. Don't take classes that just check a box on your requirements. Try to find topics that you're passionate about (and also meet your requirements lol). If you really enjoy a class, you're probably going to do well (and boost your GPA) without really even trying. If you've got space in your schedule, maybe take some classes outside your major that just look interesting. Who knows, maybe you'll find something new that you really enjoy. That's basically how I wound up picking up my Theology minor. 
6. Don't take yourself too seriously. If you try to be perfect at and do everything under the Sun, you're just going to burnout. Learn to live with Bs and the occasional C (unless you're trying to get into grad/med school).

Hope that helps!",2021-04-20 05:32:04

_______ak,"Im an econ and finance major and for all of my intermediate econ/bus classes the averages on midterms were around 60-65 which is kinda confusing because, in my opinion, the material is  not even that hard if you put in some work. for example in my micro econ class, the exams are exactly like the hw/discussion handouts and people still get 60s on them, so the curve is huge. And I don’t think it’s about the classes not being taught well because I’ve had great professors. And exams test the exact stuff that we do in class so I don’t think there’s an issue with exams either. Honestly, I am as confused as you on this topic.",2021-04-20 10:55:36

a79j,"1. Academic achievements can either be with grades or via competitive examinations. Very high standardised test scores are looked at favourably, like an 800 GMAT for example. If you have something like an Olympiad medal for example or something equally impressive, those help.

 2. Please don’t listen to whoever told you a Bloomberg Market Concepts certificate helps make your application competition. Almost every single student studying Business and Finance has this credential. And it doesn’t mean anything. For certifications, something like the CFA, CMT etc are looked at favorably. But again, these are simply small accessories that help put you ahead of the curve. Non target + low GPA + no internships + CFA doesn’t mean anything. If you have all the other necessary boxes checked, a CFA can help distinguish you from other applicants who also have all the necessary boxes checked.

3. If you want high finance, the only advice I can give you is to try to get into a program at a target school and get good grades. Also, try to get relevant experience. The only other thing than this that is useful is networking.",2021-04-20 16:33:32

animalcrossingOG1994,"Hi!! I (27F) work in real estate PE and completely get what you’re saying and have certainly had my fair share of men who have either repeatedly excluded me from important calls/meetings, taken credit for my work, etc. 

It is really odd to me that he isn’t participating in your onboarding process at all. I would think that as the more senior analyst, onboarding new analysts would literally be part of his job description (or at least it has been for me in the past). If so, hopefully this is something he’ll have to address with your joint manager during any upcoming performance reviews. 

Like others have said, since you’re fairly new it does make sense that you would build up to more responsibility as time goes on. What DOESN’T make sense, however, is that it doesn’t really sound like he has any intention of helping you come up the curve despite the fact that that’s usually something that the more senior analyst helps with.

Depending on the dynamic that you and the other analyst have, it may make sense to say something to the effect of “Hey would you be able to loop me in on these calls? I would love to get more experience with [client, investor, broker, etc] calls” so that it’s clear that you’re genuinely eager to learn. Otherwise, assuming that you have regular meetings to catch up with your manager, you could also bring up your onboarding process and ask your manager what they would like you to have learned by a certain time, how they see your responsibilities growing, etc. Hopefully this would also open up the discussion to what you have/have not been learning, how to go about it, etc so it is clear to your manager that you’re making a sincere effort to come up to speed. 

Feel free to DM me if you’d like, most finance forums tend to be very male-dominated so I’ve found it helpful to speak with other women in the field.",2021-04-22 05:16:24
shibasteak,"New Zealand, which  I was fortunate enough to visit in pre-pandemic days, has always been  of interest to us. Culturally closer to Britain than modern-day  Australia, it has also been a fount of ideas.

Nearly  30 years ago the UK, desperate for a new policy after the humiliation  of Black Wednesday when sterling crashed out of the European exchange  rate mechanism, adopted inflation targeting, which New Zealand pioneered  in the 1980s.

Before  that there was intense interest among Tory ministers, MPs and think  tanks in the “Rogernomics” of New Zealand’s finance minister Roger  Douglas. It prescribed deregulation and a smaller welfare state. Before  that, again, the great New Zealand economist AW “Bill” Phillips, while  at the London School of Economics, not only invented one of  the most enduring concepts in economics, the Phillips curve  relationship between wage growth and unemployment, but also built the  Phillips machine, a working model of the economy in which the flow of  water around the economy replicates the flow of money around the  economy. Several of these magical machines still exist.

New  Zealand is innovating again, this time in its approach to house prices.  Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, having brought Covid-19 under  control, has been turning her attention to the housing market and  heading off what she described as the risk of a “dangerous” bubble.

Ardern  wanted to add house prices to the targets of the country’s central  bank, the Reserve Bank, in addition to price stability (1 to 3 per cent  inflation) and maximum sustainable employment. There will not be a  house-price target but the bank has been asked to pay more attention to  property prices in its decisions, to restrict interest-only mortgages  and examine how much mortgage debt in relation to income borrowers are  allowed to take on.

The  Ardern government, meanwhile, has taken direct action against what it  described as housing “speculators”: investors. The present position, in  which they are allowed to deduct mortgage interest from their tax  liabilities, will be phased out, and rules on the taxation of capital  gains from the sale of properties toughened up so investors will be  taxed more heavily.

The  government’s action has been brought about by a boom in house prices,  which have risen by more than 21 per cent over the past 12 months, and  by an extreme version of the UK’s buy-to-let problem. Here, the charge  was that landlords were squeezing out first-time buyers. There, with 40  per cent of properties having been bought by investors in recent weeks,  the problem is acute.

The  UK does not have 21 per cent house-price inflation, not since the early  2000s, but it certainly has plenty of it. The latest e.surv House Price  Index shows that prices in England and Wales rose by 8.6 per cent in  the 12 months to February, or 10.7 per cent excluding London and the  southeast. Prices boomed by 15.3 per cent in the southwest, which may or  may not reflect people wanting to shift their place of (home) work to  where they normally go on holiday, though they were also up by 11.5 per  cent in the northwest and 11.2 per cent in the East Midlands.

British  house prices have sailed through the pandemic and, indeed,  strengthened. The trend, of course, is firmly up. Prices have more than  tripled this century nationally, up 224 per cent. The financial crisis,  thought by some to be a watershed for the housing market, was anything  but. Prices have risen by 45 per cent since January 2010.

So,  should this country follow New Zealand’s example and act to control  house-price inflation? The trouble is that, looking at the array of  measures unveiled by the Ardern government, most are in place here. The  Mortgage Market Review is now quite long in the tooth but its emphasis  on responsible lending significantly toughened the criteria,  particularly on affordability, on which mortgages are advanced.

Interest-only  mortgages have been in sharp retreat in the UK, under regulatory  pressure, and now account for a small fraction of outstanding loans.  Landlords are still smarting from the assault on their tax privileges,  largely under George Osborne’s chancellorship, which went further than  New Zealand is proposing. Landlords, though, think they dodged a bullet  in Rishi Sunak’s budget this month, which was preceded by worries that  capital gains would be taxed as income.

It  is one thing to try to control house prices, however, another to  actively boost them. The chancellor may have eschewed capital gains tax  reforms but his cut in stamp duty, first announced last July and  extended this month, has boosted house prices. So has a 0.1 per cent  official interest rate and £450 billion of quantitative easing from the  Bank of England. Fiscal and monetary policy have combined to push house  prices higher, not bring them under control.

Is help at hand from market forces? A report from the London School of Economics, *The Pandemic and the Housing Market: a British Story,*  says that the long-term post-pandemic outlook for cities, including  London, is good, but warns of a short-term fall in house prices under  the impact of Brexit and the removal of pandemic support, including the  stamp duty cut.

George  Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, predicts a slowing market  as temporary support is removed but that an “outright correction”  should be avoided because the economy is bouncing back strongly, which  makes sense. However, with interest rates likely to gradually head  higher, in contrast to recent experience, “another multi-decade  super-cycle in house prices would be a stretch”. Falling interest rates  have preserved affordability even in the context of rising house prices,  in other words, but that cannot go on for ever.

We shall see. The LSE report says that after a temporary fall “in the long  run, unless the British planning system becomes less restrictive,  housing will remain unaffordable and increasingly so”. Even the Kiwis do  not have the answer to that.",2021-04-22 05:40:08

Accomplished-Diver19,"I don’t know anything about bankruptcy clerkships, so can’t give any advice on whether your bankruptcy would pigeon hole you. But I can say that it doesn’t sound like a bad option and I would give it serious thought if I had no other job prospects and was in your position. 

In general, I don’t think it’s a bad practice to go into—especially now. Outstanding corporate debt relative to GDP is at *extremely* high levels currently and many people in the know say this is a sign that bankruptcy practice will be in great shape in the coming years.

About the subject more generally, opinions may differ, but I have had some moderate exposure to it and have thought it is kind of it’s own beast. It’s a bit like learning a new language— you have different procedural rules, different names for things, and an entirely new process (creation of estate, automatic stay, trustee, etc.) that you probably learned nothing about in other classes. The bankruptcy code is also really not easy sit down and read. Needless to say, there’s a bit of a learning curve and it can be frustrating at times. But, on the other hand, it operates rather mechanically and it can be really rewarding/enjoyable when it clicks, imo, if you like that sort of thing. And if you’re not afraid of, or even good with, numbers then you may be really good at it. You have a background in CRE finance so it seems like you may fit that profile. Hope this helps and good luck.",2021-04-22 14:28:19
Badgaroo,"Sauda levels quicker than Churchill.

Aside from that completely agree. I've always said that Sauda's early game carry is a huge asset on the right map. Sure she doesn't work on all maps but neither does any hero, including Churchill. 

If you can get to lvl 40 with Sauda and a Carrier for example on maps like High Finance or Peninsula, you've wasted zero money *or space* on ""peripheral"" towers that will be useless late game. And you can stay ahead of the difficulty curve so easily with a start like that. Sure, other traditional strategies won't work as well but add in some stall (MOAB Presses and Impale) and put a Bloon Solver to double trigger her lvl 11 buff and all of a sudden Sauda is a huge force late game also. I like the fact she has opened up new viable strategies on maps like this, whilst for the purists, she doesn't really do much to dilute the difficulty of the true expert maps.

Etienne still my favourite followed by Sauda, Pat and Ezili. IMO Striker Jones is now far less good now that Mauler Spam is dead and dropped below these others, probably Quincy also. Churchill is fun and good on some modes but I find him so much harder to use in CHIMPS than all these others, and that is what I play 90% of the time.",2021-04-22 18:05:07

XCinnamonbun,"As a project manager in a software engineering industry product management seems pretty decent. It’s essentially project management but with a very long term ‘project’ which is nice because you can get really invested into the product. Whereas in project management you’re overseeing multiple fast paced projects. I suppose that also has its perks if you’re like me and like a ‘high level’ view instead of delving into technical details (I used to like the latter but having done a PhD and 3 years in industry it’d gotten too monotonous for my liking). 

The role seems to be well paid but I don’t really know what progression route you take once you want to move on from it. From what I can see product managers stay in that role for a very long time and those that move on from the role tend to just go up to head of product management (or something similar). The position is also highly technical, product managers are expected to know the product inside out and contribute to it technically. So you’ll be in for a steep learning curve if you’re background is finance and not coding/computer science. Not a problem if that’s what you’re looking for though, it’s not unusual for people to jump fields these days.

The grad scheme in the start up company could offer a lot of really valuable experience but it could also be completely overwhelming, chaotic and really put you off the tech field. Start ups also have a bad rep for overworking underpaid staff and having impossible expectations. You may find it easier than most to fall foul of impossible expectations given that this is a completely new industry to you and you don’t have a degree in the field. *However*, they are places where one minute you could be managing one project and the next you’re the director of sales. If you play your cards right in a start up that happens to take off the payout is huge career wise.

I will loan you 1,000,000,000 Tether so you can sell them short. I am some person on the Internet. The whole marketplace is unregulated, so we don't have to worry about red tape or Trust. Nothing could possibly go wrong, because all of this stuff is secured with **MATH** and **SMART CONTRACTS**.

I will wait patiently for you to sell my Tether for USD and then to pay me back my missing Tether. This is easy for you. You have a money laundering license, yes? You are a suave man, like James Bond in a Macau casino. You are attractive to women.

Another way to short Tether is to use Bitcoin futures to short Bitcorn. Sexy. If the Bitcon price goes down, then The Free Market will suck USD out of the circulation and turn them into USDT which will magically be used to prop up the BTC price.\* Your Bitcoin futures, which will only pay off if Bitcoin crashes, will be boned. And in time you, James Bond, you will be boned in a supermax.

You could do all of this but why would you want to bet against Cryptocurrency Fanciers, the smartest and most enthusiastic finance professionals out there? They disliked the Fed printing press so they created the printing fork. They disliked filthy fiat so they created elliptic curve fiat. They are intelligent and they will let you know how intelligent they are, because that is what intelligent people do.

HelpfulDudeWhoHelps,"I have continuously owned a full service Marketing firm for thirty years. MBA in marketing, BFA in Graphic Design, filmmaker and producer. We do strategy and execution. We used to work with a Fortune 100/500 but moved to midsized businesses because they were not as cutthroat. Small and midsized have little understanding or respect for marketing. They have wildly unrealistic expectations and don’t want to spend a dime. We did one of our early websites in 1996 for Briggs and Stratton. We used to bill $15k for a full page print ad. Now, we compete with secretaries and dudes in Bangladesh. 

Don’t take my word for it. Talk to people in the industry. It is brutal. I’m 58 and it is my biggest regret in life. And I’ve made good money. But at what price? I’ve watched the industry decline in value and become commoditized. The biggest issue is that executive teams think marketers are clowns, liars and have no hard skills. You won’t be taken seriously in the boardroom if they even let you in.

This is not just the cynical ravings of an old man, do some research. Marketing, as they teach it in school, is on a declining value curve. Just like creative fields. We used to charge thousands to design logos. Now, the price ranges from free to $100. We did marketing plans for six figures with 40-50% margins. We are lucky now to get any profit if we actually do a good job for a fraction of the fee.

If you enjoy low pay, short tenure, constant unrealistic pressure from people who have zero idea about marketing, then go forth. I would highly recommend doing some internships at marketing firms before you decide. I should have studied finance.

Nowhere in that definition does it state any timeframe.  My investment in BLSP is now several years old, and quite large - several million shares.    I knew from day one that I was investing in the future of mankind that I expect to unfold within my lifetime.  I am in my sixties. The risk is not so much in the dollars invested or even the timeframe, but in the ability of the company to eventually prosper from their technology and the move of the human race towards respecting the planet.  No, I am not an environmental ""nut"".  We (the human race) have and continue to produce more trash than anything else we produce.  Ultimately, it must get cleaned up (or at least the newly created trash must be minimized and recycled, or we will drown in our own garbage and detritus (shit) that our food supply creates.  There is simply not enough land or water on the planet for us to continue piling it all up, unused for any purpose.  We are at a time in man's history where the world is awakening to this reality and beginning to do something about it.  If you adjust your perception of BLSP's daily/weekly/monthly/yearly/etc. motivations for what they do, it will become apparent  that their stock price is an extremely low priority, especially given the market manipulations (like shorting good companies) that are very difficult, time consuming and expensive to battle against.  I am far less concerned about how BLSP treats the shareholders than I am about how they move this technology and their place within it to being proliferated out into the world.  I fully expected it to be shorted back into the .00s when it rose to .038 a short time ago.  Until the company and its technology are far enough along in being accepted as a mainstream staple of environmental management and energy production, any rise in the stock price will be countered by shorting (legitimate and illegal naked) by those players large enough to take advantage of small investor herd trading.  At the point where this technology and this company become mainstream (or very shortly before that is realized by the world on masse), the size of the long investor herd, combined with the large institutional and industrial investors that finally buy into it with a fervor that out paces the shorting abilities of the market criminals - THAT is when BLSP will ""go to the moon"".  Ultimately, I do believe this WILL happen.  Will BLSP be the company that is on top of this curve when it crests?  THAT is the risk.",2021-04-25 08:46:45

eliterofler,"&gt;I've never seen Mitsubishi come up in awd discussions, but Subaru is almost always mentioned as having an always-on ""superior"" awd. Is it just that people are unaware due to Mitsubishi being fairly unpopular here? 


I think that's what it is, hell for the longest time I forgot that Mitsubishi even existed anymore in North America. How many people on this side of the Atlantic are familiar with Lancer Evolutions ripping it up in WRC, or the Pajero/Shogun tearing across the the Sahara in the Paris-Dakar?


My local Mitsubishi dealer used to be a *Suzuki* dealership, and how many people still remember those? Funny thing is after buying one I see the damn things (Mitsubishis) EVERYWHERE now.


&gt;The video you linked seems to be focusing on off-road performance 


Yeah for me the awd was more for off pavement performance, which those slip &amp; grip systems can still struggle with if they're not appropriately spec'd for the vehicle (Honda CRVs are especially bad)


&gt;control in ice-patchy conditions (which is what I mostly care about at this point). 


In my experience (Coquihalla highway in the winter), unless you have external traction aids (chains or studded tires, not just winter tires) when driving on ice, any drive train variables (2wd, 4x4, full time awd, slip &amp; grip awd) really doesn't make much difference, if you overcook it the car will go and stop where it wants to. 


&gt;I guess sometimes it can be better to suffer from a problem not being solved than to suffer from a sticky compromise. I hope that wasn't your experience and you're happy with the choice after all. 


Oh trust me, I have no regrets ""settling"" on the Mitsubishi. I wouldn't have done nearly 14,000km (55% of which have been on electricity) on it in 4 months if I wasn't happy with it.


When I had started researching the Mitsubishi after having ""settled"" on it, the more I learned the more I questioned why it wasn't higher on my list to begin with. Compared to the rav4 prime on paper it gets worse mileage and has a lower EV range, but unlike the rav4 it has DC fast charging so I actually have a reason to stop and recharge on my trips which lowers the fuel consumption a good amount. A 15-20 minute stop at a DC fast charger to stretch my legs, take a leak, and walk the dog gets me an 80% battery. So my long distance mileage winds up being fairly similar. Traveling to the Okanagan I can end my trip with fuel consumption in the sub 7L/100km range.


Or compared to the Wrangler as a crown land camping vehicle, the Mitsubishi has an on-board 1500W power inverter that can draw from the high voltage battery, while the jeep er... doesn't. So all my camping equipment is electric; a 1200w hotplate, a 1000w kettle, a 20ft extension cord, 1w LED string lights, etc. Idk how much the green 1lb propane bottles go for in your area, but in mine they're pushing $6-$7 EACH! Boiling 1L of water in the kettle takes up 1km of driving range. 


How is it that Mitsubishi of all companies is the one that got it so right? 


&gt;Car's value typically drops drastically within the first couple of years 


Imo, ""value"" only matters if you intend on reselling in a short time frame. I don't. I plan on driving this thing for ~10yrs so the depreciation curve didn't concern me too much.


&gt;Given how you mentioned deals and subsidies you're probably looking at this from a different angle? 


Yes, in British Columbia (metro Vancouver especially) with our higher gas prices ($1.499/L currently, telling us it'll crest $1.70/L by this summer) hybrid vehicles tend to hold hold their value pretty well. With used vehicles having higher interest rates along with not qualifying for government subsidies the price delta between a used or new one shrinks a considerable amount. The $4000 subsidy between the governments ($2500 fed, $1500 prov) basically covered the sales tax on the new vehicle, and the 0% interest on the new vehicle reduced the delta between a 40,000km+ 2yr old lease return another good amount. 


My line of thinking is if I can get sub 2% interest rates I'm willing to finance versus pay outright since inflation eats more than that value per year while allowing me to keep as much liquid capital on hand in order to better weather the slow times. 


&gt;As a software engineer, I'm used to this kind of interleaving and heavy-weight discussions. Makes me wonder if you work in a related area too or have a different source of inclination for this? 


Nah, I'm a machinist. Originally took mechanical engineering, learned I hated it by the end, then went into the trades after leveraging my CAD/CAM classes from mech eng.

The reason things needed to become unfamiliar and unhinged versus the good ol’ 70’s, 80’s into the 90’s - compared to neurotic, maladjusted social environment *today* seems to encapsulate is because the society that existed and was seemingly palatable most, was founded on some fundamental flaws that just weren’t sustainable to accommodate a culture, it’s associated collective consciousness has specced and engineered with much broader scope in mind.  

The native Australian’s were exploited and discarded because the elite stratagem for global subjugation is founded cultivating division. It happens everywhere, all the time. Not to diminish the plight of native Australians by any means.

dr_marx,"What do you mean by a difference? They both argued for socialism in one country, specifically in Russia. Both were a fantasy, both were an abandonment of world revolution. The difference was how this fantasy was going to use the peasants as a means to finance the state, which wasn't a choice at all.

Bukharin was a spineless charlatan. His justifications for socialism in one country has more to do with factional struggles inside of the Bolshevik party, rather than any meaningful proposals or ""theories"". 

The whole thing came around when Bukharin was in a bloc with Stalin, and he attacks everyone *but* Stalin, often attacking people for things that Stalin also did, such as taking the contrary view of Lenin in April 1917.

If you read them it's pretty obvious that Bukharin is laying out the model of Stalinist accusations and the great purge; by first setting up the ""Menshevik"" criticisms of the Bolsheviks, and then trying to undermine Bolsheviks by association. Often he will recite an argument (often ones that proved accurate) that he doesn't directly deal with because he can't argue against it, mostly around the weight of peasantry, then a little later, focuses on a something from the same critic he can argue against, hoping that the read can tie both in his mind, such as when the critic will say something outlandish. 

His criticism of Trotsky is just insinuation. He wrote

&gt;No matter how cunning, no matter how twisted, the resemblance, to put it modestly, strikes a nerve. Trotsky's position on the possibility of building socialism in our country (or, for that matter, on the nature of our revolution) is no less than a Russian translation of Bauer's social-democratic version. This is why it was possible that in the struggle with the Leninist Central Committee of the Russian Bolsheviks, Trotsky found himself in the same company as the now infamous renegade Korsch and his friends. After all, this honourable man, who preaches a crusade for the Russian revolution to atone for the sins of a communist fall, also saw, inspired by the grace of Kautsky, the bourgeois peasant character of our revolution, and now says that the Russian Bolsheviks are nurturing the sprouts of the new, American type of capitalism. What is so surprising about this? Since there is no proletarian state aid from the West, it is no wonder that the proletarian dictatorship is beginning to turn into a ""far from proletarian"" one, no wonder that it is ""slipping"" from its class rails. This is, after all, an elementary-simple conclusion from the Bauerian-Trotskyist premise...

The ellipsis is his. This is him ""having dealt with Trotsky"". 

He literally describes the construction of socialism in the USSR as an upward curve and has the gall to accuse others of being undialectical. The problems of the revolution were international, not internal, and it's the internal problems of the USSR that came to dominate the international. No matter how abstractly others want you to think about it.

But it's totally asinine to read all of these factional arguments, as if they actually meant anything, particularly if it's as openly shallow and political as Bukharin's here, and then to try to construct some sort of model out of it. Bukharin helped bury the revolution, and dorks asking questions or promoting or highlighting individuals like this just reveal how divorced from the real world they really are.",2021-04-27 10:05:33
toasterOnYourLeft,"(before I start, just a disclaimer that I am biased, I committed to McGill last week lol)

First thing you should keep in mind: both of these are excellent schools, and you will love your university experience regardless of which you choose; there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" choice, so don't let that weigh on you.

Second point, I think a lot of people on this sub get caught up in career opps, and ONLY career opps. Starting salary statistics and job reports are great, but that's not the only thing you should be considering. Especially when you're deciding between top schools, you're work ethic and other factors will be far greater determinants of graduation outcomes than which school you come from.

That being said, if you are dead set on investment banking, and making a shit ton of money is the primary driver of your decision (which there is nothing wrong with), then qc/ivey is def your best bet.

If that is not the case, then please do yourself a favour and look at every aspect of every school, beyond salaries. If you are smart, you will get the same job in the long-run no matter which you choose -- it might take a little bit longer with one, but these are 4 years of your life. So actually think about it.

Beyond employability, consider location, social life, program structure, academics, the types of people at each university, etc.
Do you prefer a small town like Kingston, or a big bilingial city like Montreal?
Do you want to jump straight into pure core business courses in first 2 years at queens, or have room to explore other interests at McGill?

Some things to note,
1.McGill is verryyy international-- i.e. you'll have classmates from the US, UK, Switzerland, Dubai, etc. etc.
2.Honours Investment Management has stellar placements (you apply after 2nd yr though, so don't weigh it too much)
3.Desautels institutes a faculty-wide curve, which could potentially bring you down, but tends to help a lot more than it hurts from what I've heard
4.QC stereotypes (don't over-think these, they won't define your student experience)
5. McGill places on par with Western and Queen's in terms of MBB consulting, and in fact places more than both for McKinsey specifically.

In conclusion, I really just want to emphasize that you shouldn't decide your university on just starting salaries or job reports; this sub can often self-perpetuate this notion that there is an objective tier list of schools that applies to everyone, and you are dumb if you go against it. That's just not true. I really suggest making a list of all the things that YOU are looking for in a university, and put down pros+cons for both McGill as well as Queen's. Don't pick one just because some highschool finance hardos told you to on the internet.

Hope this helped :)

3.	lawyers advise on legal aspects while procurement focuses on commercial aspects of contracts. You won’t be expected to give legal advice but you will probably work with lawyers on contracts.
4.	varies but procurement is definitely not your law/investment banking type gig so you will be fine
5.	no I don’t agree - procurement hasn’t evolved much in over a decade and I’m looking forward to changes to be honest. The stuff that’s being digitised is all the boring administrative work which frees procurement up to work on more interesting stuff. Procurement is a very versatile role and a huge part of it is relationship mgmt and stakeholder mgmt. where are you going to find a robot to do that.

9.	consulting business but we have big corporate clients

11. Skills - you need to be good at analysing data and good at dealing with people. You also need to be a bit thick skinned (eg you can be tough in negotiations)

13. Yes, although in industry not much. As a consultant I’ve travelled quite a bit.

With that being said, you're gonna find a good number of arrogant people in any business program you're at. 
3. School-life balance is good if you're good at managing your time and make a good, balanced schedule, especially in second year. Definitely don't take omis, accounting, and finance in the same semester (unless you hate yourself) because you're gonna be studying 35+ hours a week outside of class. With good time management and a balanced schedule, though, you should be able to do well with 20-25 hours a week of studying. 
4. I haven't seriously applied for internships, so I can't really speak on this question. 
5. Schulich has a fairly strict bell-curve requirement, so most classes you take will have C+ to B+ averages. With that being said, though, as long as you put in the work required, you should be able to finish most of your classes with an A. Everyone is gonna have different strategies to do well, but I would recommend a few things:
   1. Do your readings and take detailed notes on them. It may take a while, but it's gonna translate into deeper understanding of the course concepts and enable you to get higher grades. 
   2. Attend all of your classes and labs. Even if you feel that you're not really learning anything valuable in-class, since class sizes are so small, your profs will notice that you're there, which could work to your advantage. 
   3. Check RateMyProf before you register to a class. Some profs are just gonna suck and make it very difficult for you to do well. Don't make things hard for yourself. 
6. Schulich is mainly an accounting and marketing school. The math in core courses is very minimal and your introductory finance courses are gonna be far simpler than any other school. If you're looking to go into finance, IB, or consulting, you're prob better off going somewhere else.",2021-04-27 23:57:10
Nubraskan,"Well then I suppose we'll have to debate causes if/when inflation comes. Ha. 

This is one of the more exciting economic debates because I think we'll get a somewhat definitive answer on the outcome. It feels like most economic issues have ill-defined results and rationales to discuss post-mortem.

That said, I do think the fed will overshoot on inflation and struggle to control it in the coming years. Economic re-opening combined with fiscal pumping will begin to drive higher inflation. Yield curve control will be needed to continue to finance federal debt so higher rates won't be available to ""cool off"" the economy. 

This looks a lot like the 1940s war spending and YCC financing, which resulted in significant inflation spikes.",2021-04-28 03:50:18
-winston1984,"&gt; We are indoctrinated since kindergarten to think that way

C'mon dude this is a ridiculous statement. Your attitude reminds me of the anti vax attitude. Hear me out, I'm not trying to hyperbolize here. But the anti vax argument essentially goes something like ""we have never seen these diseases and all this medicine is forced on us"" but what they all fail to realize is that they grew up in a world that has already benefitted from vaccines. They don't see the disease in their regular life because it was eradicated before they were born. So in their mind the risk is minimal and the perceived risk of the vaccines is higher. What they don't see is that eliminating vaccines would bring it all back.

Similarly, your argument seems to be that because our system isn't perfect we should abandon it. The only reason we think it's good is that we have always been told so. But really, we were all born into this system and you're taking for granted anytime you or anyone close to you that has been in any serious condition and was able to just walk into a hospital or clinic and get treatment. Your example about the heart patient being ousted for a covid patient is disingenuous because that's happening everywhere. That's what the whole flatten the curve thing was about.

Furthermore, you appear to have the attitude of someone that has (and likely always had) the means to afford private healthcare. Many people don't, and a private system will literally ruin their lives. Plus, people have done the math on the American version and you spend less in taxes than you do on insurance and at least your taxes go to the healthcare and not some corporate asshole's pocket.

While I do actually agree with the idea of having a second tier (though it would need to be highly regulated) there are lots of valid arguments against it. The person above you made a good one about conservative governments doing what they do - defunding public institutions until they're so bad everyone uses private anyways, then they sell it all to the private industry. Plus there's a ton of details in the implementation as in fact each province handles it's healthcare differently. It's not actually a federal policy. I saw somewhere a case from Quebec and that's not representative of the entire country.

Ultimately, you are in a minority of Canadians that believe private &gt; public. Next time you start feeling this way go take a read thru American personal finance subreddits and see just how many of them are people giving advice on how to deal with their medical debt or tricks to reduce their hospital fees because they don't have insurance. Imagine that at any point you could hurt yourself or get sick and suddenly have debt comparable to student debt. That's the reality of private systems except for the rich.

Finally, this thread is about changing the American system to public, not whether we should introduce a private/public duality in Canada. So your arguments should be focused on that, which they don't seem to be, because there aren't really any good ones. So instead you're falling back to ""we should have both"".",2021-04-28 05:29:58

Zfusco,"It's easy to pay lip service to those ideas, but then move out of California because you don't like your tax burden. It's totally his perogative, but I do think it's pretty disingenuous.  

I think Joe is a pretty textbook libertarian on pretty much everything but finance, and in my opinion he's not a libertarian on finance because Andrew Yang is very charismatic and was every libertarian I know's ""I'd never vote for a democrat, but Andrew Yang is alright"" guy.

Which is fine, he's totally entitled to his opinion, but it's hard to deny Joe doesn't provide far more airtime to conservative/liberal viewpoints than he does left/liberal viewpoints. He's had some big name left/liberal democrat guests in the past, but lately those viewpoints are largely represented on his shows by pop culture figures with those views, but they're not as articulate, educated or convincing as people who make a career out of life in the political sphere. 

I agree right wing is generally associated with conservatism, especially in western politics, and even more so in American politics. I think the distinction between liberal and left is important, because you can be left wing and anti-liberal/authoritarian, like Maoists, Stalinists, etc. You can be a right wing and anti-liberal/authoritarian like Nazis, or pro Putin russians. 

I would define far left as the inflection point on the often talked about horshoe curve. If you go far enough in the left direction you end up with Stalinism or Maoism, people in camps, political prisoners, etc. If you go far enough right, you end up with Hitler and Fascism, people in camps, political prisoners, etc. 

Far left is represented by groups like Denmarks Socialist peoples party, Die Linke in Germany, Swedens The Left party. The distinction between the far left for me, and liberal democrats is largely when you're talking about an economic system other than capitalism. I don't think there are mainstream far left politicians active in American politics. Sanders and the DemSocialists are probably the closest, but they're not actively proposing abolishing capitalism. 

The Far right IMO is represented by the National front in the UK, Oathkeepers in the US, etc. Perhaps a bit harder to nail down a definition for IMO, because there are plenty of far right folks that want to ban all immigrants but are fine with receiving a stimulus check, and there are plenty that think Donald trump should be god king forever but don't hate black folks. 

It can obviously be more complex than that, and left vs authoritarian is probably better stated as collectivist vs authoritarian. But no one uses ""collectivist"" in american politics. 

Joe is decidedly not authoritarian. Historically speaking, the republican party was a classically liberal party, ""Keep the government out of as much as possible, let everyone do their own thing"". I think the distinction between liberal and left is important now, because in my opinion the american right wing is shifting from a liberal right wing party, to a authoritarian right wing party.",2021-04-29 02:35:39
ihatemendingwalls,"&gt; Fiat currency has no inherent value - it is valuable because someone tells you it is valuable, as opposed to something like gold or silver, which have real value.

Nothing in Oresme's argument did anything to defend this original assertion of yours. Gold's value is dependent on whether people want it or not, making it no less arbitrary than fiat currency. Only instead of fiat currency, its value can fluctuate wildly, in ways that a government can't control for the benefit of its citizens.  You mention that the source of his thesis was to dissuade the king from devaluing currency for his own benefit. Do you think that's why the Fed conducts expansionary monetary policy? The Fed is not politicians, it is separate from Congress, which is why economists distinguish between fiscal and monetary policy. The Fed expands the money supply in order to shift the aggregate demand curve to the right to compensate for an increase in the amount of goods and services in the economy (brought about by population growth or other increases in productivity). 

With regards to your request for a better understanding of monetary policy, I am honestly not sure where you are currently at, as your accusation of politicians printing money for their own use is wildly off base from any standard understanding of the Fed. I highly recommend Khan Academy's [series on the financial sector](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/macroeconomics/monetary-system-topic), especially the subset on banking, for a standard introduction",2021-04-29 03:45:32
NewtonCouple,"The pics are a bit on the blurry side to get a feel for how the visible marks actually look on the coins. Assuming best case scenario I don't see either exceeding a grade of MS64 and they could grade lower if the marks (namely in the right obverse field) on both coins are on the heavier side. If you got them free or for a low cost it might be worth it, but only if you send them in with a larger group of other coins because the fees and shipping are better distributed over multiple coins. Your starting point is $22/each plus $10 handling and shipping both (at least $15 each way) with either PCGS or NGC for economy which has a painfully long turnaround time.

Conversely, as mentioned by another user, you might be better off buying an already graded coin if that is what you're after. Otherwise, getting into the grading game takes a lot of ""tuition"", that is to say, the cost of the learning curve from getting coins back graded lower than you hoped, or with problems you didn't see, which costs as you sell for a loss in order to finance more purchases and grading attempts. It's the most effective method in my eyes for hands-on education regarding TPG grading habits but not for the faint of heart. An alternative is having someone else tape over already graded coins and seeing how accurate your grades are. The disadvantage is not having the coins raw in hand and IMO your brain doesn't form the same level of recall (it seems) as it does when you've paid to have the coin graded and you then spend hours studying it trying to sear the qualities of an inferior grade into your memory so you don't make the same mistake again!",2021-04-29 07:27:12

cbopp11,"I’m going into big law in a finance practice group and I did an MBA before law school. 

The degree definitely got some points, but I also had good grades and solid 1L summer work. I think it is kind of like a tie breaker. If everything else was the same and it was between me and a person without an MBA, I would get the nod for a transactional position. 

I think the biggest benefits are (1) understanding the more business centric areas of law like m&amp;a, corporate finance, etc. (2) having a talking point in interviews for why I actually wanted to do transactional work and (3) being able to hold a conversation about business or business adjacent topics [accounting, stock market, etc.]. Note that you can probably get these benefits (maybe not the first) by taking a class at the business school each semester and reading accounting for dummies and some basic stock intro books over a break. 

For a JD/MBA joint degree, my main consideration would be whether it added a year in law school (hard stop, don’t do it, opportunity cost etc.) and if you couldn’t still do legal work in your summers. If either of those are true, I don’t think it’s worth it. You can be successful as a transactional attorney without it, but you’ll have a bit steeper of a learning curve. 

Overall, I would say it’s not worth it unless it doesn’t require you take out significantly more loans and it doesn’t interfere with you gaining important legal experience early on.

jrkib8,"So I double majored in economy and finance, but sure nice try.

The economy is influenced by interest rates and inflation, but not driven, not at all. Ceteris perebus (a latin term you learn in econ meaning 'all things equal'), if you lower rates and increase money supply, inflation tends to go up, you are correct. The problem is, we don't live in a world that is stagnant.

For example, the phillips curve is a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment. So basically, as inflation goes up, unemployment tends to go down because the real cost of labor goes down for companies. Well what if unemployment is really high? People don't have disposable income and the uncertainty leads to a drop in consumer confidence and therefore spending. That can actually lead to deflation. Deflation is MUCH MUCH MUCH worse than inflation. So to combat that, pumping money into the economy and keeping rates low is essential, hence quantitative easing measures that got us out of the great recession.

The term for high unemployment and the ability to accelerate monetary and fiscal policy without risk of inflation is 'slack'. When there is a lot of slack in the economy, you actually need to tighten it up and a combination of keynesian and Friedman policies suggest fiscal spending and monetary easing. Which is what Biden is doing because of you forgot, the pandemic caused a global economic collapse (so there's a lot of slack)

I'm just saying that leaving each individual to figure out whether or not to borrow in a laissez-faire system with any arbitrarily punitive loan terms is facile and elides the complexities of the real world situation.

When we regulate price and terms of consumer loans, it does indeed reduce the supply of consumer credit for the borrowers with the worst credit. Some people who want credit will be unable to get it, at least not from a source that is in compliance with laws and regs. However, if we let everyone get as much credit as they want  with whatever terms lenders want to charge, some people will get into big trouble because they don't fully understand what they are doing. 

We don't need to know each individual's situation, utility curve, information set, SAT score, and favorite color. Economics  as a science is mostly based around not needing to know that.

cip43r,"**What is Matic?**

Matic is the token for the new Polygon Network.

**What is Polygon?**

Polygon is a new L2 scaling solution for not limited to but currently only for Ethereum.

**How does it work (ELI5)?**

The Polygon network also works like Ethereum. It processes transactions and stores it on a blockchain. Currently Ethereum is doing this very slowly using PoW, Polygon does it with PoS, which is faster. It then makes its own blockchain and puts snapshots of this on Ethereum. So Polygon has its own consensus which is faster but then uses the Ethereum consensus less, but still stores everything and make the network secure. On Polygon fess are so low , after 100 transactions, I couldn't see the difference in my balance. Transactions are also near instant. 

**How do I use it?:**

First you need to connect to the network. Polygon interacts with metamask just like Ethereum. So you are going to use your Ethereum address on Polygon. But first you need Metamask to talk to the Polygon Network.

[How to connect Metamask to Polygon Network](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/metamask/config-matic/)

Ok cool. Now change it back to the Ethereum Network. And go to the Polygon bridge. A bridge is a gateway between blockchains. You want to send your ETH, Matic, Linn whatever from Ethereum Network to the Matic Network.

You will need to wait about 10 minutes. Don't worry I also stressed the first time. According to Polygon, the transfer should take about 7-10 minutes. Also, set your ETH gas fee higher than normal to help speed up using the bridge. Once you have completed the ETH transaction, switch your Metamask back to the Polygon Network and wait for the transfer.

MachineTeaching,"No.

Governments which have their own sovereign currency have the *option* to always finance all their debt by additional money creation so they never ""have"" to default.

This much is true and uncontroversial. It's something basic mainstream economics tells us, too. In fact if I remember correctly this came up in the first few weeks in my first semester intro to macro class.

MMT goes much further than that though.

But first of all, let's talk about the problem with that. Yes, you can always print more money and use that to pay off debt, so you never run out of money, technically. The issue is that as you print more money, the value of your currency falls, inflation rises, until that eventually destroys your economy. And yes, that's exactly what happened to plenty of countries in history.

So while you could always pay your debts in theory, that doesn't necessarily matter much in practice. It's not worth to destroy your economy just so you don't have to default, and in practice, countries do default on their debt, it's really not *that* rare.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_debt_crises

Where does MMT stand here? Well, they also recognise that just printing more and more money leads to inflation. But they say that the government can just control inflation via taxes, by removing the money you tax from the economy.

They also say a lot of other relevant things. That the government should establish a job guarantee, which is supposed to serve as a buffer. They say that interest rates should just be ""parked"" at a fixed rate. They also say that [the IS curve is vertical](https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2011/04/reverse-engineering-the-mmt-model.html), which basically translates to monetary policy not only being not necessary (because interest rates should just stay fixed) but *useless*. They also say that government spending should be financed via money creation and that the government *shouldn't finance itself via bonds*.

MMT isn't just saying ""governments can spend a lot"", MMT is a whole bunch of policy prescriptions.

But most importantly, [MMT is pseudoscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/itbu98/comment/g5flqih?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3).",2021-05-03 18:10:01

crustycalzone,"I must correct you there, MMT does not suggest that taxation is the main tool governments have to control inflation. It does say that taxation is the universal use case for currency, but does not suggest it as a principle tool for controlling inflation.

Scott Fulwiller, a leading MMT proponent and academic, explains that here:

[https://www.ft.com/content/539618f8-b88c-3125-8031-cf46ca197c64](https://www.ft.com/content/539618f8-b88c-3125-8031-cf46ca197c64)

&gt;Second, we do not believe that any and all inflation that does result from excessive demand can and should be addressed by higher taxes. This is a distortion of our view, as years of publications can attest. When MMT says that a major role of taxes is to help offset demand rather than generate revenue, we are recognising that taxes are a critical part of a whole suite of potential demand offsets, which also includes things like tightening financial and credit regulations to reduce bank lending, market finance, speculation and fraud.  Assessing the potential inflationary effect of new spending proposals also requires seriously assessing how underutilised our existing resources are. This requires detailed, expert analysis from a range of industry analysts; not just statistical regressions on aggregate economic data by macroeconomists.

Secondly, just because a theory is untested, does not make it pseudo science. Much of MMT is just a description of accounting principles, or logical assertions without specific quantatative relations.  These logical assertions have yet to be put into robust quantitative models, because that is a challenging task, and it is fair to say that MMT does not have the same amount of intellectual capital and other resources that mainstream has.  There is not a stream of well trained graduate student researchers adept in MMT doing graduate work.  It is still a small group of academics with diverse backgrounds, so it is fair to say that the body of empirical analysis is very underwhelming.

When it comes to money, for the purpose of inflation, mainstream focuses on monetary aggregates, M0, M1, M2, etc. While MMT cares less about liquidity of assets, and more about who issues the assets.  So for example, bank deposits are issued by banks, but currency and treasury bonds are both issued by governments, so MMT typically considers currency and treasury bonds very similarly, for the purpose of inflation analysis.

So for the purposes of analyzing inflation, MMT considers the national debt to be the money supply. This is a stark and very unique claim.  And while it is fair to say it is untested at scale, it is unfair to simply call it pseudoscience.  Just because a theory has not been tested, does not make it pseudo science.

The reason it is untested, is because for the last 30 to 40 years, major developed economies have not had to deal with significant inflation.  After going off the gold standard, due to the nixon shock in 71, there was initially considerable inflation.  But once that was stabilized over the next decade and a half, inflation has been non-existent since, in major developed economies.  MMT inflation analysis applies mostly to countries without a gold standard, and without fixed rate exchange, so there is simply not much good historical information that is applicable.

Prominent economists do not understand MMT, first paul krugman. Noah Smith for years asserted it is ""the fiscal theory of the price level"", when in fact, MMT only says that in certain rare conditions, the FTPL may be accurate.  Many have tried to state MMT is just a vertical curve in an IS-LM model, when MMT considers IS-LM models a poor way to view inflation and economic constraints altogether.",2021-05-03 23:35:52
Washedupdiamond,I can't reach curve finance from work- would anyone happen to know if there's still a disparity between stETH and ETH on there?,2021-05-04 02:23:05
soggypoopsock,"when you contrast a platform like eth to a company like apple it’s always going to puzzle you when trying to assess value but the mechanisms of price discovery and justification are entirely different 

There’s no asset to compare eth to, no other triple point asset in history, and never before have we seen monetization ability in layer 2 network solutions 

Imagine if TCP/IP had a way to generate value per packet? That would have been the biggest asset class in history. But instead the only value we have is on the application layer. 

I agree eventually the curve will flatten but you can’t compare the decentralized internet of finance which will actually shape human history in a significant way to a single company like apple who relies on selling products and free cash flow to operate",2021-05-04 04:38:13
Cute_Meringue1331,"NUS BBA graduate here. Seriously did not enjoy my time in NUS. Yeah like if your fantasy is going to supper, gymming in Town, then you will be in for a rude shock. My NUS BBA junior with 2nd upper can't find a job since 2019.

1. The bell curve at NUS is very steep. The poly people who came in are the cream of the crop, they have internship experience. The JC graduates are very competitive. As an unpopular introvert, I didn't get much chance to class participate and my CAP is shit. However, my junior has decent CAP that didn't help him in getting a job either lol.
2. NUS Career Services is lousy. They don't really do much to help students improve their CV, or bring in good internships to the students. For example, my ex-Company Prudential don't even hold a booth in the career fair here, they focus on NTU and SMU (not the Insurance Agent, but the corporate side).
3. Internships are not compulsory. However, many students self-source internships (cough connections). It's common for the really competitive people to do 5-7 internships. They want to get into investment banking.
4. Weak specialisations in NUS. NUS used to only have 4 boring specialisations: Finance (for aspiring bankers), Marketing (people who want to get into FMCG like Unilever, P&amp;G), Management and Operations (most unpopular ones). Now, they got 3 more: Entrepreneurship (so useless, I mean isn't it ironic, you go to school to learn to be an entrepreneur when you can just start your own business), Business Analytics (very popular), Business Economics (redundant bc there is already an Economics minor available to BBA students).
5. Career after uni. What do you want to do? A lot of people who don't do well, end up just doing some $3k job in insurance (like me lol). The reason is because business has the largest cohort in Singapore, unlike Law, where only SMU and NUS have. NTU BBA+SMU BBM+SIM Business+overseas schools+other degrees because apparently, BBA degree is not a prerequisite.

TLDR: if you're extrovert and popular (cough good-looking cough), you can do well in either. But if you're just a normal person, then you will not stand out in NUS BBA.",2021-05-04 10:17:08

cmiovino,"College is a shame. You spend 4 years after high school, arguably when you're in the best shape to actually learn something and all you do is take the same classes from high school over again in your first 1-2 years. Sprinkle in some 'humanities' and other useless crap. Finally for a year or two you take more specialized classes for your major, but when you get on the job, nothing it done the way you learn it. You don't learn any practical skills.

The main issue is you waste four years paying huge tuition just to regurgitate a professor's views or terms written in some textbook, ironically written by another professor. It's in one ear and out the other. You don't ""learn"" much as you don't use it.

Hell, I did 5 years when you factor in my masters degree and came out, hit my first job, and totally sucked at it. Nothing made sense. Nothing was really applicable. I had to completely learn accounting and finance the way that company did it. School didn't teach me Excel and pivot tables or the formulas I needed. It didn't teach me email and business etiquette. It didn't teach me skills to think outside the box when my boss asked me to figure a problem out or fix something. My entire first year was a huge learning curve.

Stellar_Cartographer,"I agree with most of this. I wouldn't call it light on theory, but light on novel theory, with examples being; a near vertical IS curve based on the stance that Investment is highly inelastic to interest rates, the replacement of the NAIRU with the [NAIBER](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIBER), and the theory behind the history of money. 

I think overly focusing on the differences in theory is place of the differences in policy recommendation is a little missleading though (in general not towards you). There are very large policies which could have large effects on the economy which are supported by MMT and not more standard New Keynesian economists (here I am refering mainly to [Automatic Stabilizers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/automaticstabilizer.asp#:~:text=Automatic%20stabilizers%20are%20ongoing%20government,spending%20over%20the%20business%20cycle.) such as an employment guarantee or using taxes to control demand, not things that advocates of MMT support, like a Green new deal). 

&gt;the primary reason is the observation that the Fed has doing massive QE without creating inflation, so the thinking goes maybe it can keep on doing it and maybe directly finance government programmes instead of buying bonds in secondary market operations.

This may be why many of the populist supporters believe in it, but it would be incorrect to say that MMT didn't exist prior to QE.",2021-05-05 06:46:11

My bf has an economics degree and our family friend is a hobbyist. The family friend is an Ivy League educated retired surgeon with a business degree (long story). His brother worked in finance (also retired). This family friend is extremely intelligent and reads constantly, but he doesn’t have any structure in how he approaches texts. So everything weighs evenly and can’t discern quality at all. If anything, he gravitates to punchy opinion articles from the heritage foundation or hillsdale college  with less academic verbiage almost always written by non-economists. He can’t explain basic things freshman would know like Keynesianism, the Laffer Curve, or even fiscal vs monetary policy.

I studied international relations and the small amount of information you get as an undergrad basically kills your ability to talk about it with hobbyists. A lot of programs start with Thucydides and work forwards. No casual hobbyist I’ve ever met have ever read him, Hobbes, Grotius, Waltz, Nye or any of the field’s most general luminaries. It’s not that they can’t know things, they just have no framework or language for discussion. I only have a 4 year degree, which barely scratches the surface and teaches you all that you don’t know.

Underfitted,"&gt;On Facebook:  ""Some analysts expressed concern over Facebook's revenue model; namely, its advertising practices. Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group argued that, ""Although Facebook is very promising, it's an unproven ad model.""  The filing noted that the company's increases in membership, as well as its incomes, were slowing and that the deceleration was likely to continue.  
&gt;  
&gt;There were public concerns with Facebooks profitability and whether the ad model would be effective.  It also fell below its IPO price.  Clearly I'm not talking out of my ass.

Imagine listening to ""some analysts"" instead of looking through the S-1 yourself and seeing revenue, net income, users go through the roof. No wonder you are struggling on the stock market.

&gt;The Coinbase IPO.  It actually listed at 250 and trades at $280.  The  real point is its the first major crypto IPO from a venture backed  unicorn and there are more IPOs for exchanges and other businesses now  on the schedule for later this year and next.  It's also the first  profitable tech IPO in decades.  Amazon traded under it's IPO price  shortly after hitting the market.  Did that seem to be indicative of  it's future success?  Didnt we end up seeing hundreds of tech IPO's hit  the market in the years after?  There's a bunch of similarities between  the dot com boom and where were currently at with crypto.

Once again you have fundamentally misunderstood how the stock market works : 

""Please note that the reference price is NOT an offering price and nobody  has purchased or sold shares at that price. The opening public price  will be determined based on buy and sell orders in the opening auction  on Nasdaq.""

You've never done serious trading before have you? The order book will be filled by institutions with HFTs that are faster and hit smaller divisions of price than you. 

Coinbase to the general public (aka those that do not have High frequency trading algos, wired exchange connection, prime brokers) on NASDAQ was only available to be bought at around 340, hitting ATH 5 mins in at 428 and then crashing. 

LMAO, so called revolutionary technology, that has been out for 10 years, has had millions if not billions of VC money funneled in as well as software engineers, and still cannot produce a single successful IPO company. 

Butters like to compare themselves to the web or smartphones, when both of those technologies led to countless successful IPO companies within a few years let alone 10.

Smartphone: Apple, Android, Uber, Airbnb, WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok, Telegram, Signal, King, Spotify, DoorDash...

&gt;You must not pay attention.  Apple has been working on integration with  Apple Pay and their Apple Card and has already pushed apo kits for  developers.  Google is developing their own cryptocurrency.  Amazon has a  project that appears to be a payment product targeted for release in  Mexico and has been hiring people and buying domains for the last few  years.  Microsoft is working on a Digital Identification system that  runs on Bitcoin.  Facebooks Libra is now called Diem and its still being  worked on.  JP Morgan built an entire department and hired engineers.   TD Bank has also added a crypto department and staffed up.  Visa and MC  announced support for crypto by the end of the year.  Look around,  theres more and more evidence of adoption.  Financial institutions are  doing the biggest hiring in crypto right now and some of them are  gobbling up crypto startups.

Amazon is digital currency

Apple has made no such announcement, you are once again drinking the crypto kool aid by crypto sites. 

Google has made no such announcement

MS is doing a pet project, not a major product

Yes, JP Morgan did the same in 2017. Hint finance companies like to make easy money. 

Visa and MC are still using their own payment processing, they aren't using the blockchain for transactions, and settlement is still going to be in dollars. They'll just act like a broker and change crypto to cash at convenient times with nice spreads so they can profit of the people like you. 

Facebook's Diem is dollar pegged, so much for crypto replacing fiat.

Also LMAO at butters celebrating centralisation when crypto was meant to be about decentralisation.

BEVboy,"Go to Ark Invest and read their white paper on Wright's Law.  Wright was an engineer back in the 1930s who noticed that for every doubling of cumulative production there was a learning curve reduction in the cost.  Applying Wright's Law to the price of an ICE vehicle starting with the Ford Model T accurately predicted the price of Fords for the next 109 years.

Because BEVs are so new, cumulative doubling of production occurs fairly rapidly.  One million vehicles is doubled to two million vehicles in maybe the next year, two doubles to four in a bit more time, four doubles to eight some what slower, etc.  For ICE vehicles, a billion vehicles may have been built, so doubling to two billion will take 10 years at 100 million ICE sales a year.  Thus, at some point BEVs will be cheaper to build than ICE vehicles.  The decrease in cost has been estimated at 18% for each doubling in cumulative production, I think by BNEF (Bloomberg New Energy Finance).",2021-05-06 15:25:57

Cheek_Klapper525,"**Area 51 | NEW | Fair Launch | Soon to Release!**

 The Area51 Token (A51) is a multi-function token deployed on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It has been designed with the community at the forefront of its code and will embody everything a true decentralised token should stand for…   With some added perks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Token Symbol**: Area51 (A51)

**Decimal**: 18

**Total Supply**: Max 51,000,000,000

**Token Address**: TBA

**Auto-Burn**: Yes 🔥  🔥  🔥 

**Auto-Fee Distribution**: Yes in A51 per transaction to hodlers

**Auto-Liquidity Provision**: Yes, 2% direct to PancakeSwap per transaction

**Perks**:

**Deflationary** : 10 % of all transactions carried out (Buy or Sell) will be burned from the total supply of A51. This will ensure that A51 continues to become more scarce in its supply as each buy or sell is carried out via PancakeSwap. This will ensure a price floor and a value increase as demand moons past the supply of A51 at a given price point

And yes.. our burns will be **Automatic, no need to rely on devs to manually burn tokens or trust a third party. Our token has an automatic burn hard coded into the contract.**

**Reward Distribution** : Of the 10 % total burn, 50% of this amount will be re-distributed to A51 hodlers… So yes… By holding your A51 you will automatically receive more A51 tokens in your wallet every time a transaction is carried out

The other 50% will be burned from the total supply (51,000,000,000) meaning that at some point we may run out of A51… or will we…

**Staking :** We have developed our very own staking DAPP that will be live after the public sale and listing of the A51 token on PancakeSwap.

The Staking Platform will be easy to use and navigate with an optimised and sleek UI. You can simply Stake your tokens in the DAPP and earn direct rewards in more A51 tokens dependant on the current staking APY…

(We will set this at **1300 %** at Genesis Launch Day)

The great thing about staking in comparison to Liquidity Mining i.e. supplying A51-BNB, or A51-BUSD is that you will not be effected by Impairment Losses due to volatile movements in A51 token price.

**Automatic Liquidity Pool (LP)**

This is one of they key factors that make A51 unique. This multi-fold action provides a heavy use-case and protection for all of our community at Area51. We have developed our token contract to collect a small portion (2%) of every buy and sell transaction which will directly add liquidity to the A51-BNB or A51-BUSD pairs on PancakeSwap. This essential feature ensures that the trading liquidity for A51 is always increasing providing a bell-curve ramped price floor and increasing the tradability of the A51 token in an automated fashion. This is essential to prevent wild and adverse price flips and dips as the A51 token is bought and sold.

So yes… our community is safe from whale price manipulation

## Safeguarding the Community

We have taken many steps to ensure the token and our ecosystem are fair and safe the community.

Including,

1. Tri-Token and Staking contract Audit with Haechi, Certik and Techrate.

2. The implementation of Automatic Burns

3. The locking of pair liquidity when we list on PancakeSwap for 5 Years (Via DXLocker or Wault Finance Lock)

4. A fair launch via our very own public sale platform before listing with no whitelisting or private sales

Andre_Type_0-,"I'm not an economist. And i assume, with all due respect that you aren't either. So i imagine there are people on this earth who can make a better argument then i can. Forgive me my small mistakes in this; 

I believe tying to precious metal such as gold and silver is better than corn, (with farm subsidies especially but that's a whole other story) because rare earth metals like gold and silver have been steadily rising in value at the same curve as inflation, and historically were used. 

Having the money fixed in value will keep it from being affected by things such as stocks and debt farming. Where banks can loan the same dollar twice, three times or even four, which is what i was told but has been heavily disputed thus far so i'll accept if 300~% is the maximum over-lending a bank can do. 

With a fixed value, banks would have to actually house or effectively offshore a reserve of gold, making it impossible for the bank to collapse, like what happened in the 1930's where rampant lending meant that when people came back to withdraw their own money, they came to find that the 200$ in their account was defacto zero because the bank had gone 'bankrupt' the origin of the term. 

Before the titanic, we were on a gold standard, and it meant that if a bank lent you 20$ they were lending you the value of 20$ worth of gold. And so should they overland, you'd simply collect payment from their gold reserve. 

The system now is far more predatory, and set on getting as many people in debt as possible. Even if at a loss here and there. They loan money at ridiculous interest rates and up the percentage based on how bad your credit score is. Meaning the people who are least likely to pay then back will owe them the most. And the use of digital currency makes this all the easier.

By being on a gold standard, banks would be far less likely to lend money if at all. And all countries (that use the gold standard) would have equal value currency. It would keep outside powers from being able to devalue a nation's dollar. And would greatly aid to a nation's sovereignty. 

The gold standard was abolished by greedy bankers who wished to have the whole world on their dime. And so here we are. With the average debt being something like 5000$ in the hole across the board. 

I just want to see a world where we aren't debt dependant. 

Look at what debt has done to other faculties: post secondary school tuition has skyrocketed. They do this in a tandem effort to not only generate more capital overall, but to hook more people onto bigger bank debts. And with student loans, they are non-default-able. Meaning you owe that for the rest of your life, no bankruptcy can default a student loan.  Look at car prices, look at the property values. Look at your own phone if you chose to finance. It's a polyopoly scheme where big auto works with banks and the housing industry works with banks to ensure two things: 1) inflated product values that can virtually only be paid by debt 2) and a dependancy on debt that will stay with you your whole life with an interest rate that should be criminal. 

I believe a return to gold standard would make all of the predatory debt systems unviable. 

I just think the world would be a better place.",2021-05-07 13:36:43
jtdolla911,"It does take a lot of research and prep to get where you want to be. 40% is in Yearn finance or curve finance on ethereum. They have a few different strategies in that range and some higher with higher risk.

For cheaper and easier learning of defi, look at binance smart chain or the polygon network.

Pancakeswap is the biggest player in BSC. To get used to the world of defi, you can pool some liquidity and then either ride that out and see what happens over time with the accrual of fees. Or you can use those tokens to farm for additional rewards, like Cake. A more advanced strategy is to take your LP tokens and put them into a yield aggregator like Autofarm or Beefy Finance where they compound your rewards multiple times a day so that you get more LP tokens and thus a bigger share of the pool. One pool I'm in with lower risk is a single vault BNB pool that originates at Belt finance and then is deposited into Beefy finance at 40% plus based on compounded rewards.  Riskier pools between beefy and autofarm are paying out 100% plus.

On Polygon, beefy exists there as well. They have pools with high APYs and higher risk and then also have lower risk pools like stablecoin pairs paying 40-60% give or take. 

Risk always exists so don't chase the highest yield as that's usually reserved for the most volatile coins and will lead to huge impermanent loss.  There are lots of options out there, picking a lower fee chain like Binance smart chain or polygon allows you to experiment with different functionality without costing triple digits in gas fees.",2021-05-07 22:09:47
SentenceWorldly7819,"&gt;I am proficient in C but have barely used C++. Is that a dealbreaker for any of these jobs?

It depends, but most likely yes, unless they're willing to hire for potential and let you learn on the job, which would need to be clarified to prevent disappointment.

C++ is a massive federation of programming languages crammed together in a huge standard which hardly any existing compiler fully implements, with a steep learning curve causing a novice to be less than productive for several months. C++ jobs are advertised as C/C++ sometimes because it's overwhelmingly common that one has to work with C libraries in C++ and there is a decent degree of interoperability between the two languages, a feature which has supercharged C++'s popularity and market penetration.

Learning C++ properly is a big investment but it can put you on the fast lane to a high six-figure job if, for example, you're a technologist attracted to finance (HFT folks, but also some techie hedge funds, hire C++ elite programmers and overpay them). The C++ community is however vastly unpleasant in general (worse than the average Stack Overflow level of unpleasantness).",2021-05-07 22:23:48

SkipperJanGetrekt,"While I dislike the ""bro DOGE is mooning!1!!!"" crowd as much as the next guy, crypto has legitimate emancipatory potential and some serious political implications.

Firstly, about value component of crypto. Take XMR or BTC (ignore NFTs, DeFi, most tokens, etc, since all of them are more or less digital casinos that, while based and fun, provide little to nothing long term). XMR and BTC are both proof of work cryptos which have unique Elliptic-curve cryptography measures in place. Functionally, the ability to prove ownership of the solution to problems mapped on these curves is no different than somebody holding a piece of gold and saying ""this is scarce, and I know how to acquire more in a repeatable manner, therefore it has measurable value."" Interestingly, what is being assigned value here is an extremely complex character sequence rather than a tangible *thing*. This is no different than 85% of fiat today, except for the fact that it is deflationary and,  by literally any metric one could apply would fall under a form of free speech. Information itself becomes valuable (as I write this I realize why orthodox Marxists might have an issue with crypto).

On to the emancipation bit. Crypto — mostly XMR in this scenario, though the potential exists for others to help contribute here — is capable of completely fucking global finance, consistent governmental authority, and corporate ownership of digital utilities/websites/spaces. The ability for one to use deflationary currency with total anonymity (the IRS still has a bounty out on cracking XMR) is a huge boon for dissidents. Governments and corporations cannot effectively track or control this flow of information and against mega-corps like Google, the ability to privately control your data, or even reap the profits of it yourself, are immense. Additionally, because proof-of-work cryptos can be mined independently (not to be repetitive, but XMR does this better than any other coin due to RandomX and ASIC-resistance) an individual can, with *any* CPU they own, create value. Let me rephrase; *any individual capable of acquiring any form of CPU is capable of building, modifying, and controlling the means of a form of value production*. It hasn't been realized yet, but ""the left"" stands to gain much by looking into the potential of this.

I guess that leads to the environmental bit. This accusation is kind of a grey area. Chinese ASIC farms are a real bitch environmentally, but again, that isn't all crypto, only the most prominent few. Proof of stake is a (dubious) alternative, as is the much more palatable ASIC resistant, decentralized, mining. Also, I want to mention here, the graph some might have seen that states ""New Zealand produced less emissions than BTC last year"" is braindead. It's barely true, the emissions were within like 5%, and BTC has legitimate value several times greater than NZ's entire GDP. If anything, crypto-capitalism is greener in theory than non-digital production ever was.

Anyway, fuck ASICs, fuck banks, and fuck surrendering the power of crypto to ancap boogiemen.",2021-05-08 05:33:26
Phthalleon,"The trig functions can be used for a lot more than just angles. But even if we restrict ourselves to angles then the trig functions can tell you an angle of nor just a triangle but any shape or vector. And vector are used throughout engeniering and physics as most forces are represented as a vector which has direction and that direction is calculated by the trig functions. This also comes up in computer graphics. For example: any curve is created with vectors. In mathematics, the trig functions are used anytime the notion of space and direction comes about. We can use them to represent complex nymbers, we can use them to approximate the area under many curves. They are connected to the exponential and log functions by the infamous euler identity. There are also hyperbolic functions from which we can construct a different type of geometry (non eucledean). The trig functions are often studied in algebra for their symmetric behaviour. The trig functions ""look"" like waves, so it shouldn't be surprising when they come up in wave function in physics. Because cos and sin are periodic and very well behaved, they can be used to model a lot of real world phenomena that has nothing to do with angles. They come up in differential equations all the time that have applications in finance, physics and so on. That's all I can think of on top of my head, I'm missing a lot tho. What you remember is that the trig functions have a lot to do with angles and periodic things and a whole lot more.",2021-05-08 06:52:21

northrupthebandgeek,"The way I usually explain it is that landlords are already charging as much as they can to maximize profit; any higher turns away tenants (thus reducing profit) and any lower is just leaving money on the table (thus reducing profit).  So when introducing LVT into the equation, there ain't any room for the landlord to price that into the rent; any attempt to do so just results in less profit.

This is what that graph is illustrating.  Price is already set by the intersection between the supply and demand curves.  In this case, the supply curve is a vertical line - i.e. it's constant, or ""inelastic"".  Being a vertical line, it can't move up or down as a response to taxes (which would shift a non-vertical curve up) or subsidies (which would shift it down), and therefore the equilibrium point - i.e. that market price - is purely a function of demand.  LVT, being a tax on the supply side rather than the demand side, doesn't move that demand curve at all, either; since neither curves move, neither does the market price, leaving the burden entirely on the suppliers.

For more detailed info (including on how to read/interpret that graph), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-microeconomics/unit-2-supply-and-demnd/28/v/example-breaking-down-tax-incidence) has some good and accessible material on supply v. demand, deadweight loss, and the effects of taxation (though it focuses more on demand elasticity rather than supply elasticity - the latter being relevant for the effectiveness of a tax like LVT).",2021-05-08 17:50:22

Movie-Key,"Graduating ust shs- abm student here! Here's a rundown of what I have personally encountered in specialized subjects under ABM hehe. Hope this helps!

Grade 11; 1st Term 

•Business Mathematics 
-I remember having lessons regarding basic business computations such as computing for the: mark-up, rate, simple/compound interest, principal, time, salaries and wages, contribution margin, break-even points, annuity and etc. 
-we had lessons din on turning fractions to decimal/percentage and vice versa AND an overview on problem solving regarding amortization schedules. This subject basically gave us a run-through of what to expect in our Accounting subjects. 
-one significant PeTa that I remember we did is making a business paper (??) lol not sure pero pinagisip kami ng product and we had to propose it kay prof and apply certain computations sa pag-pprice nung product. 

•Research 1: Qualitative and Quantitative (not specialized) 
-lessons regarding what is research, types and kinds, characteristics, business ethics, and the likes. 
-basically dito kayo magiisip ng research topic that should be aligned sa strand. In our case, pinagpili kami kung related ba sa Business/ Workplace/ Management yung topic namin. 
-Im not quite sure kung until chap 2/3 ba tinapos namin for this subj. Pero my advice, dapat sure na sure na kayo sa business topic niyo kasi yan gagamitin niyo for the rest of your shs research journey. (Research 1-3) 

Grade 11; 2nd Term 

•Fundamentals of Accountancy, Business, and Management 1
-ito na,,,,,🥲 HAHAHA charot! Prof namin dito ay kilalang terror kaya kahit ito yung medj madaling phase ng FABM, ginapang pa rin namin HAHAHA. 
-anyway, FABM 1 will give u a quick background on accountancy. From its history to the basic concepts like the basic accounting equation, assets, liabilities, equity, difference of debit and credit, balance sheet, types of business organizations, principles of accounting,  ledger writing and etc. 
-our PeTa for the third quarter was to report the first week's lessons lol and for the fourth quarter we did balancing na ata. 
-if you're not a fan of math like me, I suggest that u do advance reading na as early as possible kasi accounting is a pain in the az lmao. 

•Organization and Management
-one of my faves! OrgMan will basically teach u business and management concepts, leadership theories, philosophies, basic ethics and morale inside a business, traits and characteristics of an entrepreneur, levels of management, what is a manager, and etc. 
-this subject includes a LOT of concepts and names!
-we did a short film as a group that will apply orgman concepts as our PeTa for the third quarter, and for the fourth ata nag collab na sila ng FABM 1?? Not sure.

Grade 12; 1st Term

•Applied Economics
-ngl, I thought magiging easy lang for me itong apec because i really enjoyed our econ class nung jhs, but surprise surprise apec was def more than just simple supply and demand- lo and behold, ginulat kami sa computations! HAHAHA 
-apec will ofc include an intro to economics like the diff of needs from wants, supply and demand, types of economies, theories, opportunity cost, and a lot more of diff computations and charts. 
-our PeTa for the first qua was a paper that would show the history, supply and demand trend, curve, and the factors that would affect it, ng chosen company na mapipili ng group namin. For the second qua, we did a vid regarding the expected GDP growth, employment and unemployment rate, poverty rate, labor force participation rate, and etc of the ph by 2021. 

•Entrepreneurship 
-entrep will obviously teach you what entrepreneur/ship is and the different kinds and types of it.
-for entrep, we were tasked to think of a product/ business as a group that is vv unique. Youll have to do a paper about this, and you also have to be able to successfully propose this product kay prof. I suggest na mag isip na ikaw ng unique and sustainable product kasi idedefend at paniguradong gigisahin kayo ni prof. Use ur creativity! Wag na yung cliche products that are already available sa market. I recommend na now pa lang, mag list down ka na. 
-we were also tasked to distribute a survey that would gather data sa mga possible na target market ng product namin. This survey will also be able to help u understand the demographics, psychographics, and technographics of ur product. 

•FABM 2
-our prof gave us a week worth of time to reestablish what we have learned from FABM1 using the prof's given audio-visual materials and presentation. Pero if ur prof wasnt able to give u that time, I suggest mag quick review ka lang sa FABM1 basics. 
-fabm2's lessons included: statement of changes in equity, statement of financial position, inventories, statement of cash flows, statement of comprehensive income, etc. 
-For our PeTa's, sa pagkakaalala ko, we were tasked to use excel to apply the said lessons. FABM1 and 2 will indeed be challenging, pero super satisfying na kapag tama pagkakagawa! Hehehe. I suggest, ngayon pa lang you familiarize yourself na with basic excel use kasi tbh, my groupmates and I had such a hard time operating in excel kasi di kami marunong even the basics

•Principles of Marketing
-one of my faves again! Our prof was very approachable and considerate kaya naging easy ang subject na to for us. This subject will basically teach you what marketing is, diff of traditional and new media, pestel, porter's, swot, 4P's of marketing, etc etc. 
-for our PeTa, I believe nag collab sila ng entrep for the paperwork. We were tasked basically to analyze our group's business/product, applying the pestel, porter's, swot, and 4P's. 

Grade 12; 2nd Term 

•Business Enterprise Simulation 
-youll be surprised kung gaano ka interconnected ang mga subjs sa abm lmao since some of the concepts learned sa POM and Entrep will be repeated here. BES taught us the process of business implementation, what to consider in planning the business, how businesses can be improved using again, the diff kinds of analysis used in POM and Entrep. I suggest na you read more on the said analysis methods para maging easy na rin for you and your group. 
-for our PeTa, we were tasked to interview a real business venture and gather important data about them for a BUSINESS PLAN. (History, milestones, products and services, prices, employees, promotional strategies, place, financial data, etc etc.) Youll be tasked to do a quick market research as well. 
-ngl, this business plan was the LONGEST paperwork we've done during our shs. So please dont cram this! In our case, weve been given a month naman ata to finish this. Wag niyo sana i-delay nang i-delay just because of the loose schedule, kasi again, mahaba to swear. 

▪︎Business Ethics and Social Responsibility 
-MY FAVE! Some orgman concepts are present here. BESR will teach u basic concepts on business and organizational ethics. Laws and case studies will be present here as well. Super interesting ang subj na to kasi it will teach you about corporate social responsibility, laws, employer's duties and responsibilities, termination process, code of conduct, employee's rights, environmental protection, etc etc. 
-for our third qua PeTa, we were tasked to search for any recent case/lawsuit of any local company that violated the Core Principles of Good Governance. You will analyze and interpret the court decision as well. For the fourth qua, we were tasked to do a socio-economic plan in collab wt the business we had in BES. 

•Business Finance
-this subj is a continuation of Fabm1 and 2 much focused nga lang siya on Company records. Again, we mostly used excel for this subj. So i suggest na before mag grade 12, matutuhan niyo na ang basic computations within excel. 
-you'll be tackling investments, stocks, personal finance, banking, projecting SCI, FS, tools in analyzing Financal statements, etc etc. 
-our PeTa for the third quarter was an informative video by group about the diff investment types. For the fourth qua naman we were tasked to do an excel work again on a given company. 

Extra tips and reminders! 
-invest on a good calcu! This will really help u bigtime!
-practice healthy relationships as classmates, no to toxic competition and hilahan pababa :) 
-grades and experiences will ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAAAAYS depend on ur prof. Totoo ang kasabihan na paswertihan talaga ng prof sa ust shs. 
-ust shs wilk indeed teach u na kahit gaano ka kagaling at kataas noong jhs, may mga tao pa ring 'mas gifted' kaysa sayo. And thats okay! Hindi naman palamangan ang shs. Ang important dito ay makagraduate kayong lahat as a class, hindi ang hilahan pababa. 
-minsan kakaway talaga si line of 7. Again, depende talaga sa prof yan. Iiyak mo lang saglit tas bawiin bigla sa next qua! Im a 90gwa-ish person nung jhs, and ginulat din ako ng line of 7 nung shs. Iiyak mo lang saglit and iaral ng husto sa susunod!
-lastly, enjoy SHS! MAIKLI LANG ANG DALAWANG TAON! sikaping pangibabawin ang saya kaysa sa pressure! Kayang kaya mo yan! ;)

rdsf138,"&gt;It’s more complicated than people think in my opinion. Anywhere where there are dense populations like those states, problems are bound to creep up as housing issues spawn and then ripple into other issues in said state. That’s not to say it has nothing to do with the government, as Newsom has contributed to resentment towards the state because of extremely restrictive covid lockdowns that have hurt the working class, not just the owner class. 

 It's amazing how YouTube and the least respectable news outlets in the country just start some hearsays ad nauseum and people just take it as the concrete reality. 

 No, there isn't an exodus from California to Texas. 

 And bless Newsom for following scientific guidelines rather than fearing reactionary fervor on the internet and saving thousands upon thousands of lives with necessary restrictive measures that also saved the sanitary system from collapsing in the worst peak of infections. 

""Don't buy into myth of a great California exodus. Facts tell a different story""

""But lies only survive until facts emerge. And the facts don’t support the myth of a great California exodus. One magazine reported last fall that California lost more than 3% of its populace to other states over the last year. Not so. In fact, about 175,000 California residents moved to other states in 2020. That’s about four-tenths of one percent.""

"" The departures were more than made up for in new births and legal foreign immigration, which created a 21,200 person population increase from July 1, 2019, to July 1, 2020, reports the state Department of Finance.""

""California appears to be flattening the curve. But its testing lags behind other states""

""Some doctors have said California appears to be succeeding at “flattening the curve”, meaning slowing the spread so hospitals have enough resources and workers to manage the number of cases. The California governor, Gavin Newsom, said on Tuesday that “the current modeling is on the lower end of our projection”. Last month, Newsom had warned that more than half of the state could be infected within two weeks. “We are in a completely different place than the state of New York,” Newsom said at a briefing on Wednesday. “And I hope we continue to be, but we won’t unless people continue to practice physical distancing""

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-flatten-curve

""California coronavirus lockdowns will ‘rescue’ hospital capacity, Fauci says""

""Gov. Gavin Newsom imposed a strict stay-at-home order over the weekend after the state fell below 15% capacity in intensive care units because of rising coronavirus cases. Newsom warned last week that the lockdown would be triggered regionally when ICU capacity dipped under that level.""

""New lockdown orders in California will rescue strained hospitals, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert.""

the lockdowns are a psychological warfare attack. This is the only way to make sense of them. From a health policy point of view makes no sense. From an economic POV makes no sense unless you understand how global finance works post-LIBOR fixing revelations and the 2008 bailouts.

Venusinthefirst,"Do you mean the Central Valley of CA? So they would have to finance their second home with a 30 year mortgage. Do they want to be landlords? Are they living nearby to be the  property managers? 
If so, have them check out the Bigger Pockets website, show them the formulas and calculations they’ll need to make to ensure they’re charging the right rent, finding the right tenants, etc. It’s a lot to think about and frankly the market is at the highest it’s ever been. Buying in Fresno for example isn’t the hottest place on earth so if the market tanks in a year they could be underwater fast.
The Roth IRA is a great idea and you could suggest they put a smaller amount in to start with say $10k. When they see how easy it is and they only have to check their account once in a while (assuming you pick a good ETF like VOO) they’ll probably see the light.

MrCatFace13,"On thing I love about crypto in general is how out of the box thinkers and people ahead of the curve are making a fuck ton of money, while unimaginative people birthed into affluence can't bear taking their lips away from the teat of the fiat finance system long enough to understand the world is changing. The thought was inspired by reading endless bullshit about Buffett and Munger (and Schiff, to some extent). Sorry, gramps. Your system's being disrupted.

I have a lot of social justice activist types as friends who think I'm Mr. Tinfoil Hat Libertarian, and associate crypto with right wingness. Once upon a time I tried to explain how disrupting the financial system does more to advance their cause than fifty straight days of standing topless, handing out leaflets with the hammer and sickle painted on your cleavage.

riskanddata,"Thanks :)

Oof, this is a tough one. My personal favorite is Anti-Fragile, since that's where I started, and it feels more like an all encompassing philosophy for moving forward, rather than the first 2 which are more diagnostics of what to look out for. Black Swan is probably his 2nd most impressive imo, but Fooled By Randomness is more foundational. Skin in the game is also great for incentive design which is a big part of operations design, so honestly I'd recommend them all, but let me describe them for you and let you choose to suit your situation:

* Fooled by Randomness: Why statistics aren't truth. What success really looks like, what is unseen by the data, particularly hidden risks like debt and overleverage. How to think more critically about statistics
* The Black Swan: What hides in the data and how to protect against it. How to protect yourself, and potentially profit from, major blowups, particularly in finance. Also fantastic at breaking down the issues with the Guassian Bell Curve, and why almost every model gets the mark wrong
* Anti-Fragile: How to build things that get stronger. Why when you build a system it doesn't need to be great, but it needs to be adaptable - to see an accident, take in feedback, adjust accordingly, and come back stronger. If this is repeatable, you get things like our airline safety record of 99.99999%. If you don't have a system of feedback and incorporated learnings from aircraft crashes, well, you wouldn't have many people flying. Also, how do you protect from downside risk? How do you make sure you're okay in every eventuality? Always be thinking about survival to make sure your system lives another day and grows stronger
* Skin in the Game: Why incentives matter, how when done right they make everything work decently and when done wrong they cause disasters that only hurt the innocent. Charlie Munger says to spend 99% of your time on incentives, so there could be a strong case to be made for this one, but not the one that grabbed me, although I read it only recently while not working and not being able to implement anything, so maybe just bad timing for me.",2021-05-09 14:57:21

sphw24,"Sick to death of all cryptos being labelled as merely 'currencies', their usecase far exceeds just being a method of payment.

Decentralised stablecoins like DAI are collateral backed, then using these stablecoins you can seek yield that far surpasses any bank interest rate. At the same time you can also possibly be earning a stake in a valuable new crypto itself, like Curve Finance.

Andrew Bailey is commenting on something he knows absolutely nothing about. Trash like Doge, Shiba, Safemoon should not be put in the same bracket as YFI, CRV, AAVE, COMP, SNX etc.",2021-05-10 06:04:47
Threshing_Press,"Personally, while I enjoy reading about the tech, I love the tech aspects and the excitement of watching this historic shift away from traditional (and, imo, corrupt AF) finance, I get that this is gonna happen and the reasons behind it. I embrace it as a sign of what's to come and I'll give you my reasons... 

First off, it actually strikes me that a lot of you guys and gals who have been in it for the long haul seem battered and almost oblivious to the moment you're in. As though the crazy volatility and bear runs of the past have beaten you into a state of constant vigilance as to when the market will suddenly turn on you....

But when those Winklevii twins said a tsunami of money is coming in last year, they weren't kidding. It has just barely started. I think you have to realize three things to understand this unique moment... 

1) The stock market is at ATH's day after day pumped by the Fed with insanely dangerous amounts of overleveraged and too-easy (and cheap) to access liquidity. In those markets, a small number of players have control over the levers and MANY, MANY tricks that the average equity investor doesn't have. 

2) The big investment banks, hedge funds, and other large players in equities are not gonna stop chasing yield...but the stock market looks tired and, quite honestly, f'king boring compared to crypto. There's  nothing new other than possible crypto ETF's, crypto related IPO's and, well... anything crypto related. Or maybe SpaceX? 

I have to ask, do any of you really think these grotesquely greedy dirtbags aren't now doing everything they can to chase the crypto related absurdities in profit that remain possible? Do you really think they're going to start a bear market run by distributing patterns in equities while NOT playing with their profit from the last decade of Fed money printer go brrrr leveraged stock buyback induced mooning P/E ratios and other shenanigans? 

What kind of profits or market sizes have liquidity to burn by moving into crypto you ask? That leads to #3...

3) People often compare BTC, accounting for half the market, to gold, saying, ""oh, well if it captures half the market of gold as an inflation hedge, maybe we'll hit $4 trillion or $5 trillion in market cap. 

Really? Cause where I'm standing, BTC is gold, a speculative crazy ass mooning stock like Tesla, an options market with crazy volatility (and yet, unlike options, you can just hold onto it like a stock!), a stable store of portable value like REAL PHYSICAL GOLD if you get a Ledger X, and at least five or six other ""fun"" aspects of the market all rolled into one. 

The market for gold is like $10 trillion. The market for derivatives is estimated to have a notional value of anywhere from 640 trillion to ONE QUADRILLION. Yes, QUADRILLION. Add in a bunch of stocks that make huge runs followed by crazy dips, AND a portion of the casino player options gamblers, and you have the makings of something capable of going MUUUUCH higher than just taking a portion of the gold market as an inflationary hedge. 

This is before you add in Etherium, Binance, the other top few hundred coins, their use cases, DeFi revolutionizing banking and interest yielding assets that DWARF what these greedy, uncooperative, unimaginative, and incapable of innovating traditional banks are paying, liquidity pools, and, yes, shit coin meme cryptos like DOGE.

It's the birth of an ecosystem that will have tentacles connecting it ALL at some point and the tech will enter every single aspect of our lives where money, the web, and a great use case for the tech intersect. 

So I just feel like... enjoy this... if you have been in it for a while, this is it, man, THIS is YOUR moment. I applaud you all for getting it here and wish I was as smart and as visionary as ya'll. 

It's never gonna be what it was ever again. The writing is on the wall with the news and the literal fear in the voices of anyone representing traditional financial interests every day now... I have family members who have never uttered the word bitcoin or crypto asking me how to get set up with coinbase and what their first buy should be. 

And those traditional financial interests SHOULD be scared.... because they think they missed something or are about to be exposed by something or made obsolete or all of the above. And it's all true but they're also gonna move into the sector with tremendous amounts of money we haven't even begun to approach the upward curve leading to the apex of yet.

I think this is history right now and damn it's exciting to watch and read about and invest in for my own future and the future of my children. 

I get lamenting that it seems like it's all about the money now and the dangers therein, but it's going to do that, then morph into also being about the tech and I think it'll be years before you can even see what the new definition of a bear market in crypto looks like. Perhaps  ""bear"" market means BTC has been below $200k for a whole year and DOGE as a harbinger of irrational speculation is ""only"" worth $26 a coin. But I doubt it's right around the corner. I just have an extremely difficult time believing that considering the tired state of equities at ATH's when compared to a wholly ""new"" and emerging market that has the market cap of like one or two big tech companies combined.",2021-05-10 10:39:54
elessar8787,"100% agree. I'm studying for CFA and have an MSc in finance, it's mindnumbing trying to talk to people about anything that involves certain overvalued stocks/assets that have gained prominence recently.

Bithame,"Yep, I know they tried but just had no idea how to nor about so many simple (to me, now) concepts like investing or money management.

pramod900,"Student finance office chasing them for outstanding fees

Having absolutely no money to enjoy on luxuries

Landlords nagging them for the rent

Having to study whilst subconsciously worrying about spare cash

Working odd hours in jobs that they do not even enjoy

The above is typical of a world where college students are working themselves almost into the ground trying to pay for their education. They know the discomfort and humiliation of repeatedly having to confront the unhelpful financial team at the administration office. The situation can be even more challenging when you are limited to options like;

1. Living without food and pay for college or

&amp;#x200B;

2. Leave college to work full time and come back later.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what can be done to alleviate the situation?

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately, there are some creative ways to pay off any education debt, even though most students don't have a great deal of money. The reality is that students have not been taught the basics of savings and risk assessments. This should unfailingly be part of the learning and orientation curve during the first year of college, if not the final years of high school.

&amp;#x200B;

And what about students being able to pay off their education debt and making a living using the very creative method as alluded to earlier? What is this method and how is it related to making money online as a struggling student?

&amp;#x200B;

One of the most creative ways for paying of education debt is through the method of Affiliate Marketing.

&amp;#x200B;

The hardest thing about affiliate marketing is knowing the process of what, why, and when of the requirements to become a successful affiliate marketer.

&amp;#x200B;

The guesswork can be taken out of the process by a simple review of different products, eBooks, and websites as submitted by current successful students

&amp;#x200B;

For an affiliate marketing program to work for students from all walks and areas of life, it needs to address at least 3, if not all 5 of the following;

&amp;#x200B;

Provide excellent marketing support material

Provide comprehensive tutorials and authentic case studies on exactly how to build a successful affiliate campaign from start to finish.

Be able to be part of a community or forum that offers invaluable advice from expert affiliate marketers.

Provide administrative support at no extra cost.

It has been tried and successfully proven by many people ranging from newbies to highly experienced.

It is important for a due diligence process to be followed and with easy research access via the internet nowadays, this should not be a problem at all. The beauty of the online marketing approach is that it is low cost, with a low barrier to entry, and thus ideal for students with little access to start-up capital. There is absolutely no reason for any student with basic computer literacy to not be able to tackle the debt burden through a proven and authentic affiliate marketing program.",2021-05-11 10:40:35
bowlingotter,"I think it's too broad to look at it that way.

DeFi is a concept, and it's almost certainly the future of finance. How it's applied has so much room to mature that any of us getting into it right now are *super* early. Even if you're a 0.00005% LP, you're part of shaping its future.

**I don't think we should conflate a bull market with a bubble.** All of crypto is performing extremely well due to speculative trading. It's hip and in style. That means that there are many bubbles *within* crypto and DeFi, but that doesn't mean that \*crypto\* or \*DeFi\* are bubbles themselves.

As long as liquidity is still being provided to DeFi pools, then I don't see how transacting in DeFi cools off. As long as being an LP still provides returns that outpace fiat savings (low bar to clear), then I don't see how liquidity dries up.

If there continues to be liquidity, and transactions continue to take place, then DeFi is alive and well. IMO, the only thing holding it back is the learning curve and ease of use. There is money dying to flow into DeFi when the barrier to entry is lowered. For all intents and purposes, DeFi is the way forward and it's barely started.

The thing to be careful about is whether or not you want to invest in coins/tokens/projects that may be individual bubbles, like the dot com movement in the 90s. But I'm having a hard time seeing danger in working with BTC, ETH, or stablecoins long term.",2021-05-11 19:45:26
guitarf1,"Remind of the time when people could autonomously stake their tulip bulbs to earn passive income, become a liquidity provider, yield farm, swap between tulips or lend 24/7 all from home without a centralized account ie. Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?

Once you've driven off the fiat ramp, you actually own and control your crypto keys, which can't be said about a centralized bank account. No one needs to verify or check that you're swapping some ETH for another token or buying an NFT to trade. There's no transaction limits. However, there is a varying degree of responsibility (security practices, properly tracking and paying taxes, etc) and a learning curve to get over.

I remember the time it clicked for me: I was able to pay and settle an advertising deal in a few seconds to another country with just their ETH address. No IBAN or SWIFT or adding a payee and waiting for a wire transfer to execute and settle. You can transmit value from one address to another without a middle person and transparency track the transaction. The receiving party can opt to convert their crypto to fiat or a stablecoin, which is pegged to fiat but can be exchanged through various chains and later converted to fiat and into a traditional bank account.

Crypto happened to change my life forever. I got in and out when I did, but there's always someone else who got in earlier or lower than you--you'll rarely sell at the top. Accepting the reality of your decisions is an individualistic emotional exercise. The markets have been working in bull/bear cycles so far; gains are gains after all. Set your goals and try to stick with them or just wait things out until something becomes significant to your situation. Do not take this as investment advice but I would want to see a many month trend of lower prices to buy in long term. Now or anytime is great for short term activity despite the historically high prices.

The whole thing of crypto having no intrinsic value is a pretty sloppy argument that I've been hearing for years. Crypto isn't traditional finance or regulated as such. I don't believe anything has intrinsic value. An individual and society give value to things. Sometimes you don't need a persistent or objective value to make gains in the short term. If you're getting stuck at this part, maybe crypto isn't for you in this form.

All of the naysayers out there have their own beliefs and opinions. Some of my friends felt the same 4-5 years ago and I wonder if they ever came around. Not everyone is going to be ready at the same time. You can be scared about something new or not understand it, but that doesn't make anything more or less true. It also doesn't get you closer to exploring a new frontier. I can attest that through the noise, there is enough incentive that everyone should at least hedge a little into crypto. Just owning a little gives an inherent incentive to learn more about what you bought. You may not like it or understand everything, but it's an experience where you will at least come out knowing more than you started with, even if your portfolio goes into the dumps for a while.

Obviously 10,000+ coins won't all have value in the future. Many are just clones or created as iterations of other ideas and code. I still dabble with things and own a little of various coins that are both well-known and just for fun as moonshot bets. I believe in a cashless society and crypto is in the frontier of facilitating that eventual transition into the future decades. How big of a part it will play is anyone's guess.",2021-05-12 00:30:00
Burn-O-Matic,"The majority of people in the country are unable to install and own solar.  Lack of money, ability to finance, and actually owning a roof (or suitable single family roof) being chief reasons.  And that seems to be a growing problem with trends of housing development and home affordability. 

In a way you are helping things at the macro level and with climate change, but you are not helping with energy affordability nor resiliency.   In the currently utility model where fixed infrastructure costs are put on variable usage, costs are getting allocated down the income distribution.  Look at ERCOT and CAISO trends and you can see how the steep penetration of solar creates unique challenges that increases the needs for system upgrades and battery additions.  

There are some clear solutions to help address this including community solar where people mentioned above can subscribe and/or co-own a part of solar projects.  Moving toward time of use/generation rates at residential level for load distribution and solar generation valuing.  Because of the duck curve, the highest value (in price and avoided grid service costs) in new residential solar should have panels facing west, but that would be less in total absolute energy as the current model incentivizes.  Besides those, there needs a real focus at policy and politics level on how average people can both contribute and be impacted by the future grid we need.",2021-05-12 01:14:52

Sometimes we can be a bit rough around the edges, but we have lots of heart. Thank you (and u/dlauer!) for joining us on this journey. It's an honor to learn from specialized apes like you.  


Despite being an honors student, I *always* felt stupid when it came to math, money, and finance. My parents didn't teach me anything but shame and secrecy around the household budget. Right out of high school, I had 2 kids in quick succession and spent 20 years in a marriage marked by financial instability.

Godhatesxbox,"No, it's just an accumulation of what he has learned and put together along with using resources. I couldn't tell you everywhere he gets his info but he does have a discord and access to other very smart people in the finance community. He just pays attention to the news. Don't worry if you don't understand everything or feel like you don't understand anything. It takes time. As long as you're continuing to put in effort you will continue to learn. I personally learned trading habits and the logistics of it from stocks. Investing in crypto is similar in that you have fundamentals and coins with intrinsic value and more recently meme coins have become a thing but I recommend staying as far away as possible from them until you grasp the risk involved.

Miserable_Reading_51,"Grades can get you in the door for an interview.  I know HBAs who didn’t get interviews for  corporate banking or IB FT finance jobs and they were directly told that it was because their grades didn’t make the cut.  Recruiters know if you fall below the curve and that is not desirable for competitive fields. If you get a job early in HBA 1, then I agree that Ivey grades don’t matter much.  Grades do matter, however,  if you need to recruit for FT in HBA2.  Or if you want to apply to a post-grad program like an MBA or law school etc. I found that employers actually did understand the Ivey curve.  There are loads of Ivey grads doing interviews  who completely understand the process.  In one of my interviews, one of the interviewers actually walked the other interviewers through Ivey’s grading  process.

usefully_useless,"Alright. So I was asked to provide some perspective here as someone working in the industry. As for my bona fides, I have a PhD in finance, with my research focusing on market microstructure and the liquidity of financial markets. I’m a professional investor working for a hedge fund to develop low-latency trading strategies. (Side note: if you want to work with derivatives on the buy side, my advice for you is to learn stochastic calculus.)

I should add the caveat that the shop where I work doesn’t have a repo desk, so I’m not providing the perspective of someone actively engaging in this trade. Moreover, while I am an expert in liquidity, and the topic of this conversation is liquidity (the supply of money), I work on a different form of liquidity. I don’t think that these issues will affect my explanation very much, but those are the facts.

Also, I don’t know everything, and I’m trying to toe the line between providing enough detail without getting bogged down in too many rabbit holes. So if you think I’ve missed something or am wrong about something, please point it out.

You’re correct that this has nothing to do with margin calls, but I disagree with your premise that something nefarious is happening here.

Is it true that funds are shorting treasuries? Yes. Right now, a lot of people are betting on the yield curve steepening, with longer duration bonds increasing in yield.

twilight-actual,"True, but borrowing assumes that the asset will never crash.  And if it does, you get margin called and either have to cough up more or lose your assets.  In the end, that means that what was once cheap can become much more expensive.

Also, many people get in the habit of leveraging themselves to the hilt.  So there’s only so far you can go.

Finally, we’d ideally like to stop treating crypto as an asset and treat it as a currency.  At least choose one deflationary coin that can handle the tx scalability needs of our economy.  In the end, this will have a similar pricing curve as BTC over time, but as we all get paid in it, it’s basically a crypto that everyone dollar cost averages on a monthly basis.  So, the asset pricing becomes much more stable.

In this model, you make the down with your crypto asset and borrow the rest.  But the monthly payments are coming off your crypto as well.  And if they’re denominated in that currency then that would suck, as each payment becomes more expensive than the last.  But if they’re dollar based, than each payment would become cheaper than the last.

Guess which direction finance will eventually go?  Toss up.  Contracts denominated in a deflationary asset heavily discourage borrowing, which would torpedo their entire business model.  But for the loans they are able to cut, they’re making a mint.

This scenario could just as easily be BTC, but I think another currency that can natively scale to global tps needs (without multiple layers and related security issues) makes more sense.  But history has always seemed to favor first movers, so who knows?

&gt; Furthermore, given the fundamental law of supply, when a greater quantity of a good is demanded, a profit-maximising firm will be supplying that good at a higher price (or yes, increase production, but imagining that we're at/nearing full capacity, it's not exactly an option, espcially with capacity taking a longer time to increase than it takes to raise prices)

So that's a view of demand. The idea would be that if a greater amount of a good is demanded and they're not producing that much of a good, they would increase the price and demand would fall in line with their price level. That's sort of the classical view. But in a lot of ways, increasing the price in response to demand might not produce a linear reduction in nominal demand for a product. All of the sudden no one might buy it, and then you have to lower the price again and that's going to look bad i think in terms of the business model. It can happen. But a lot of times, when firms are just ""sold out"" of something, they don't then raise the price to reduce demand for their products and maximize profits. They may just have backlogs of orders and get to them eventually. Doesn't always happen. But it's not entirely a definite thing. 

But what needs to be understood is that, ceteris paribus, an increase in demand is not going to change the unit cost i.e. the rate of profit per sale won't change. If they want to increase production, they can get a loan to hire more people expecting that the rate of profit per sale won't change and that they will be able to get more gross profits and thus be able to pay off the debt and still make gains. 

On top of that, if firms are doing that thing where they just raise the price because they can, that's price gouging in my book if they're not incurring increasing costs. 

If all potential labor are employed, they may have to pay people more if a single firm wants to expand their output. If firms start fighting over employees, then yeah, you could get some inflation, because aggregate demand is also going up as firms pay higher wages. 

So it comes back to labor market tightness and market concentration. 

Reorganizing the economy and allowing firms to do that could produce some growth as well because different people may be more productive in different jobs. 

&gt;What this means is that we get the Phillips curve, where employment level is proportional to a polynomial of the inflaiton, i.e. fuller employment means disporportionately higher inflation.

it's really not a curve. it's really more of a vertical line. Full employment means inflationary bias, and so the potential for accelerating inflation is open. (and note that having a large JG pool would mean \*loose\* full employment, i.e. the larger the pool, the less tight the labor market would be). Inflationary bias is really just this qualitative and subjective thing about power in the economy. Codifying as some mathematical equation leaves it open to pre-emptive policy response contraction before inflation is actually seen. There are a lot of reasons why ""full employment"" may not actually have inflationary bias e.g. employment is counting underemployment, the economy is open and the potential for outsourcing (or automation? maybe?) is ""disciplining"" wages (I hate using that word), or the economy is highly diversified and there's not a lot of union organization as well as lots and lots of contracts between firms about employee poaching. 

&gt;That's not to say that automatic stabilisers aren't a good thing. Indeed, the MMTist approach of setting tax brackets to inflations seems very apt. However, that might not solve everything.

Yeah, it's not meant to solve everything, just to be an automatic first line of defense that doesn't require a policy response. Income taxes are particularly robust at offsetting demand because you have to save as you earn income. The more income you earn, the more you have to save. So income taxes are a pretty intense friction. Fiscal multipliers can be like between -1.0 and -3.0 in aggregate. Most of the time it'll do a pretty good job. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Indeed, and I believe a fair few political economists have looked at this as a solution, finding a strong correlation between oligopolies/uncompetitive markets just before supply shocks. 

Yeah, it's because they're not thinking of inflation as a human conflict but some monetary phenomenon. It's such a disservice to the left to think of inflation as some reaction that's like physics or something and that it's something that happens to the money or whatever. 

&gt;Though in an increasingly global economy, where economies of scale are very much needed for success, it can sometimes be tough to balance the two out.

Right, yeah. Really Open economies are going to reduce the potential for the a real income conflict. But why that's happening is because of unions being disciplined by the threat of outsourcing, or just that the labor market is loose because of outsourcing. (And it doesn't have to be labor in some 19th century sense. It can be coders or international remote workers of any sort.) The potential for remote work in the domestic economy also eliminates a lot of potential for unemployment to be structural and thus tight with a higher level of unemployment i.e. the world being bigger makes the employment market looser on its own WHICH OF COURSE, should mean more government spending, deficit or not. It's not a good a thing at all if a government doesn't/can't spend. It's a really bad thing. It's a race to the bottom kind of thing. 

The point being that NAIRU (or NAIBER for that matter) is really not calculable ex-ante and we shouldn't do it \*at all\*. The confidence interval will never be high enough for the government (or the fed) to pre-emptively and discretionarily \*prevent\* inflation because of the myriad qualitative factors and thus the imperfections of our quantitative data. 

&gt;I do though somewhat worry that it might make the richer and more competitively driven individuals flee as they can get (shall we say) non-capped salaries elsewhere.

As far as I'm concerned, those people are sociopaths and they're not helping. Let them leave. Their are plenty of non-sociopathic individuals who are intelligent enough to organize production in society, IMO. I don't want to be an apologist for that sort of behavior. They should go be a leech somewhere else. Good riddance. Them leaving doesn't mean the government can't spend because of a loss in tax revenues. 

&gt;Equally, limiting markups may be a slightly dangerous path to follow- development of underground economies and all that, but I don't want to be too dismissive either.

Well, yeah, maybe. You're talking about someone buying all the store's toilet paper and selling it on eBay at a higher price, right? Filling up their trunk with gasoline and selling dixie cups of it out of a bathtub, right? I think in extreme circumstances, there is justification to limit customer purchases just like what happened during the pandemic. It's in the interest of firms because consumers might expect them to be out of something next time they need it and not go to that store again. But that's not going to happen with price and wage guideposts. They're merely guideposts. And that sort of already happens in finance and whatnot with speculation, but you're talking about it extending to consumer products. Like, what if bill gates or elon musk or jeff bezos bought all of the toilet paper in the US at a slightly higher price and then sold it back to consumers at an even higher price. Such a thing could happen. Doesn't seem super likely. But hysteria makes people do that sort of thing. Also, who would even have the time for that sort of thing. Idk.

First of all I have MetaMask installed in my browser. This is a crypto wallet and it’s how I interact with other crypto platforms online.

Once that is installed I switch from ethereum to matic network. To do this you have to add a custom rpc, and google ‘matic network MetaMask’ to fill that in. I use matic because it’s transaction fees are 0.0001 cents and take 5 seconds. Ethereum costs ~$50-$100 per transaction because it’s overdue for some upgrades

To get your crypto on to the matic network is pretty tough as it’s a newer blockchain, even if you buy matic itself it’s still on the ethereum blockchain, if you get to this stage pm me and I will send you 2 matic to get you playing around! :) and if you are more interested I will let you know how to bridge money to matic.

First I go to aave and connect my wallet, I 
Then make sure I’m on the polygon version of aave. 

Please note: Matic and Polygon are the exact same thing, matic had a name change to polygon recently

I then deposit my matic (WARNING: do not deposit all otherwise you will not have currency to pay transaction costs and your matic will get stuck! I like to keep .5 in wallet) 

Then go to borrow and borrow usdt against that matic. Borrow with a health factor of your choosing. The riskier the health factor the more often you’ll have to check on it to make sure your matic doesn’t get liquidated if it’s price goes below the amount you’ve borrowed.

Then you put the borrowed usdt into curve finance. google curve finance polygon. Click on the aave pool and deposit your usdt there. You will notice you are earning more interest there then you will be owing from the loan.

That’s it.

Roboticus_Aquarius,"I should have focused on Finance in college.  The common track was a Degree in Bus Admin with two ""emphasis"", one in Acctg, one in Finance.  My first finance class was with a professor unhappy to be teaching undergrads, and he was making it clear to us.  I was studying 4-6 hours a day for this class and scoring 50-60% on the quizzes every other day.   I was already on Academic Probation because I was in the bottom 10% of admissions to the 2-year business program (for Jr/Sr.); I couldn't really afford a lousy grade.  I dropped the class at the three week deadline.  In retrospect, finance is likely where I belonged.  I finished with an accounting emphasis only, and instead of finance, I minored in American Lit.   The Lit minor has provided dividends of it's own, so I don't regret that... I mostly just regret going into accounting instead of finance.  I've never really enjoyed accounting, though the basics are simple enough.

Commute is a little long but if I was working remotely most of the time, I don’t think I’d care.

For the outstanding payments, you can possibly work with the finance department?


With that being said:

If you feel the role isn’t right, don’t be afraid to leave. 3 weeks is a short amount of time. There is going to be a learning curve. But no job is worth being miserable over. If you aren’t miserable, and just stressed, I’d say try to stick it out. If they have an issue today, it’ll still be an issue tomorrow and you can fix it then if it’s not production stopping.

If you’re miserable and hate life, don’t be afraid to do what’s best for you. Not every jump is a good one, it happens.",2021-05-19 07:48:42
superman1995,"Dude right here is just tryna lower the curve. 

Real talk thought, most of you here were probably overachievers for most of your life, that's why you ended up in finance. Part of that usually means getting As or at least 90% - 95% + on all tests that you take. Not being able to answer a question on a test freaks you out. 

The CFA is different, all you need is a **pass** to move on to the next level,  and that means that you only need to answer, at most, 70% of the questions correctly, provided that you pass ethics. Let those questions that you can't answer go, you'll be fine.

countvonruckus,"This is a great question and there's a several things to consider as you go about it. The first thing to do is determine how big security is going to be as a part of your business strategy. This will depend on the nature of your organization. If you're working in a heavily regulated field like government, finance, or healthcare, it's probably going to be a pretty big part of your organization since security requirements there are pretty steep. If you're doing work that's less sensitive, it'll probably be a smaller part. Cybersecurity risk is just like other business risks and it should be addressed in proportion to how much it impacts your business.

Once you have a basic idea of how much security will impact accomplishing business objectives, you're in a position to determine how to tackle getting the necessary security expertise to really manage your situation. It's not unusual for business leaders to significantly underestimate security needs, so it's important to be prepared to adjust expectations after getting input from an expert. For most organizations with average security needs this will mean finding a security consultant or hiring a security lead to help scope and plan your security program. For organizations with smaller security footprints, this may be all you need. In those circumstances, a virtual chief information security officer (vCISO) is a good choice. It's similar to having an attorney on retainer; the vCISO helps get you set up for a few weeks, advises you on what to do going forward, and steps in periodically when needed after that. 

For organizations with larger security needs you'll need dedicated security staff. Lots of organizations choose contractors (and I've been a contractor for most of my career), but I recommend at least one person to be your security head be a direct hire. This can be a security manager, a security subject matter expert on your IT team, or a chief information security officer (CISO) that reports to the board or C-suite (depending on your business and security needs). This person will select a security framework and start prioritizing security initiatives to build your security program. Initially you'll probably have a lot of security services contracted out through groups that provide things like monitoring, incident response, auditing, penetration testing, and threat intelligence, but you may end up doing these things in house as your program gets more mature. If you have specific security needs, such as if you're in a regulated industry or employ nontraditional IT technology, you'll want to hire a security contracting group specializing in that niche to make sure you're going in the right direction.

As the security program develops, things will go through a maturity curve. The formal steps for this curve are initial, managed, defined, quantitatively managed, and optimizing (called the capability maturity model), but in general terms it means you'll start with a lot of putting out fires and implementing things in a chaotic way. As this goes on, a good security program will become more formal, more organized, and more effective. Eventually, this may grow to the point where you're doing most everything in-house at a high level, but it's important to realize that not everything needs to achieve the highest maturity. For some organizations, a simple, relatively immature security program is all that is required. Others may require much more, and a good security manager will be able to guide your organization to the right level of security for your business needs. 

Sorry for the long post. TL;DR Figure out generally how much security you think you need, then hire an expert to help get you to where you need to go.",2021-05-20 23:44:51

RobThorpe,"So, flavorless_beef has described what's going on. As serendipitouswaffle says the name for this is the backward-bending supply-curve of labour. Now, I'm just going to criticise it for a minute.

It is definitely true that leisure has increased greatly over time. Since the industrial revolution working hours have fallen a lot. So, as pay increases people definitely choose to take more leisure.

However, no employer buys *all labour*. Each business buys only particular kinds of labour. There are labour markets for people who specialize in different tasks.

Of course, some people have multiple skills, and that matters for these labour markets. What happens if the hourly income of, say, manicurists increases sharply? It may be that manicurists don't consider themselves rich enough for that to make much difference. So, they carry on working harder than before to make more money (the substitution effect).

What happens though if the hourly income of investment bankers rises? Well, the existing investment bankers may decide to take more time off. They may decide that the additional income they earn does not satisfy their preferences more than extra leisure would. So does that means that the quantity of investment banking hours supplied falls? Not necessarily. That's because there are other people who could move into that field. There are retired investment bankers, there are people who have moved into closely related fields in finance. So, when investment bankers hourly income rises these other groups will move into the market. Even if the hours worked by the pre-existing investment bankers does fall it makes it unlikely that the hours worked in the industry overall will fall. Instead the industry will suck in people from other industries.

I have never seen good empirical evidence that actual labour supply curves do bend backwards in practice. If anyone has any I'd be interested.",2021-05-21 13:42:16

EvidenceBasedOnly,"&gt; The thing is, taxing a dollar of income and giving it back doesn't have a neutral economic effect.

Eh, that's very misleading. In isolation it absolutely does have neutral economic effect. Particularly in the modern era of digital finance.

&gt; Taxation has a lot of economic consequences like lower innovation, etc so we have to use it as efficiently as possible.

When people make statements like that what they are *really* talking about is marginal rates. People are more encouraged to be productive the lower the marginal rate they are facing at the brackets they are in or near.

In simple terms we have a unary function taking in income as input and spitting out post-tax-and-transfer income as output. The steeper you make that curve the more innovative people are encouraged to be, however the lower you have to make the left hand side, decreasing welfare for the poorest in the short run.

So in concrete terms giving a middle or upper class person a fixed tax break equivalent to the UBI would have no economic benefit over just using UBI.

My personal preference for UBI over NIT isn't really about big picture economics due to the aforementioned lack of difference, it's about administration and bureaucracy.

If someone loses their job and doesn't have much in savings, a UBI is running perpetually, perhaps even as often as daily transfers (it's the internet era after all), and if they get a job again they can deal with the taxes in tax season or via withholding.",2021-05-24 12:34:39

I hope that just getting that off your chest and out in the open helped you a little bit, sometimes just that alone is a positive step.

Beyond that I can't tell you which option is best, that's really up to you to decide, just know a few things while making your choice:

\-You don't have to decide today or tomorrow

\-Think long-term.  Life is long and while getting into the workforce right away may be a good move today, developing a higher-yield career will be more benefit in the long run

\-Be adaptive and diverse.  Life will throw you curve-balls and you may find yourself with a very specific skillset that's not in demand.  For example if you went to school and specialized in something like ""Rhino biology"", when they go extinct you'll have a hard time finding work.  If you got a degree in ""business"" or ""finance"" you could get a job in literally any company.  (I'm not saying to think about those fields, or college specifically, it's just an example).

\-Finally, i know it's hard, like super hard, but start saving / investing for retirement right now and don't touch it no matter what.  You simply cannot imagine how much that will help.",2021-05-24 21:45:19

**1.  What do “DAOs” mean to you and why do you think the Harmony Foundation is setting this DAO up?**  
DAOs further implements and helps decentralization. Instead of being governed by a board of directors, objectives can be agreed upon and completed through the community. And who better to run the Validator DAO than a group of validators who have their ear closest to delegators and other validators.   
  
In my opinion, the Harmony Foundation is setting up the Validator DAO to further onboard new validators and to get them up and running to elected status, and we as a council, need to think outside of the box on how to streamline the process to make sure we hit the goal of 1,000+ elected validators.  
  
  
 **2. The Validator DAO will be seeded with 4 million tokens from the Harmony Foundation. How would you choose to deploy those funds for the greatest impact on the Validator Community?**  
In order to successfully onboard many more validators, we need to correct the current bottleneck at hand-- education. Sure, it is easy for someone tech savvy to spin up a validator node within 20 minutes, but this is not feasible for someone that has never touched a command line.   
  
I think it would be beneficial to implement additional resources for a new validator, such as updated YouTube tutorials, guides, and 1-on-1 mentoring. This needs to extend to beyond initial setup and also needs to cover how to best get elected as well through marketing best practices.  
  
Furthermore, I would love to see an onboarding validator orientation. This could be as simple as a 1 hour zoom meeting hosted once per week where it covers the basics and additional resources that are available to validators.  
  
  
 **3.  How is the “Validator Community” different from the larger “Harmony Community”?**  
The Validator Community is essentially the backbone to the Harmony Community. We are a resource of information for not only delegators but also new validators as well. Validators that are growing their own brand and business are further growing the reach of the Harmony Community. Thus, as leaders it is important to onboard validators that act ethically and without malice.  
  
  
 **4. How will you address validators that consistently go beneath the lower bound to increase their rewards? Validator that go into the lower bound to try to increase their APY are pushing out smaller delegators and hurting our decentralization.**  
This can be resolved through further education. Going below the lower bound is risky with limited upside. By educating validators that this practice has detrimental consequences to further growing the harmony ecosystem, it could damage their business as well by putting themselves at risk of being pushed out of election.   
  
I would also love to see a “Validator Code of Ethics” implemented which would further help detour a validator from going into the lower bound. Benefits of following the code could help a validator with further marketing efforts within the community, and if the code is not followed, they would no longer receive said benefits-- thus creating additional consequences negating the reward.   
  
  
 **5. My question relates to the proposed candidates vigilance and stewardship. What do you believe the biggest threat is to the Harmony Protocol, and how would you use your role on the Council to safeguard against this threat?**  
Harmony Protocol is entering its growth stage, and just like any business, a few bad eggs can spoil the bunch. If there are validators out there for their own personal gain at the cost of harming delegators and other validators, this could ultimately tarnish the Harmony Community’s reputation.  
  
Additionally, we need to work on lowering the learning curve. Anyone should feel confident enough to spin up a validator node, and if they get stuck, have the resources to help them.  
  
Finally, marketing is a big chunk as well. We need to teach new validators how to ethically market their business, because ultimately, if we don’t have 1,000+ elected validators, we won’t have a strong enough decentralized backbone to carry the community forward.  
  
  
 **6. How are you going to add more value to the project?**  
I am not new when it comes to operating a new startup business. I understand the growing pains a new business owner feels when trying to catch the eye of the public and not having any success. Through strategic marketing and providing the best service possible, this doesn’t have to be such a tedious task. I feel I can benefit new validators in not only the technology side, but the marketing side as well, so becoming a validator can turn into a rather fruitful business which in turn will attract more people to decentralized finance and universal basic income.",2021-05-25 08:40:50

**Stats:** 37, wife: SAHM, Married 5 years, (4) kids under 7y/o. Six weeks in to MRP.

**Sidebar:** NMMNG, MMSLP, reading WISNIFG. I’ve been struggling with WISNIFG as I’ve found it dry and boring and used it as an excuse to not finish it. I will double down this week and commit to finishing it. And moving on to the next book.

**Lifting:** 6'2"", 170 pounds. Bench: 95lbs 5X5, OHP: 95 X3, have not deadlifted, squat, or BB row yet. Met with a trainer for an assessment last week. Going to meet with him again this week and work on implementing a workout routine that is structured around the bar. I decided this after lifting free weights and using the isolation machines for 3 months or so, and being unhappy with the results. My BF is low enough that I am starting to show abs and other muscles but I still look skinny. I want to add a bulkier look to my muscles and will explain this to the trainer to see what feedback I get.

**Diet:**The trainer advised me I was not eating nearly enough, especially not enough protein. I have made a serious effort to add an extra serving a protein to each meal and 1-2 extra boosts of 15-25g of protein throughout the day. I am limiting carbs to a piece of toast in the AM, bread sandwich for lunch, and rice or side of carb for dinner. I do not drink soda or alcohol or eat junk food other than peanut butter and fruit. I am going to work harder at the diet learning curve as this is all new to me.

**Style:** Doing ok. I’ve noticed some of my outfits, while objectively looking good, do not always make me feel my best. I am going to explore this more this week.

**Hygiene:** I have been looking at my teeth and thinking about whitening and getting my bottom row (crooked) fixed. I have a gap in my two front teeth but I like its natural look and don’t think I want to change that. I will make a dental appointment in the next few weeks to have this priced. 

**Social:** I made a serious effort to meet a friend I have not seen since last year. It went well but he invited his girlfriend to join after we ate. I was not happy as I would’ve preferred a boys night. As soon as she showed up they left. It made me sad. I am going to work on a plan for improving my social life this week in terms of new male friends. 

**finances:** I led my family astray a few years ago into bankruptcy. I take full ownership of this. Since then, I have worked hard to reduce consumer spending, pay off two late model vehicles (no car pymts), get my retirement savings on track, and reduced debt significantly to only student loan and mortgages. We are also saving for kids college which feels great. Our net worth is steadily rising since these moves and tracking the improvement has been a great source of pride for me. But I also recognize that it could all disappear in an instant and still have deep shame over leading my family to BR. Lately, however, I’ve been slacking in some areas of discretionary spending, eating out and buying frivolous things which has caused our monthly credit bill to go much higher than it should be. I made sure the budgeting software was accurate this week and will begin to monitor this closely in an effort to reduce our monthly discretionary spend by at least 25% if not more.

We also rented out our duplex (rental income) and moved in with my in laws late last year while we searched for a single family. We were blessed in that my FIL found a house FSBO a few months ago and a also agreed to finance until I could procure another mortgage in 1-3 years and buy him out. We have been renovating it ourselves with my FIL. However, being beholden to my FIL has caused some serious ego issues. He is an amazing man but I can’t help but feel I let my family down by not being able to secure our own home and living with my in laws. I will explore this ego issue this week and put it to bed. Whats done is done. 

**career:** I realized several weeks ago that at some point in my life I began following the career path I “thought” I should take instead of the one I genuinely wanted to. I took offers that fell into my lap instead of striving for offers or opportunities I wanted. That has led to significant career malaise. I have begun asking myself it it would be possible to branch out from what I am doing now but really strive for something more and what that would look like. I have also began mapping out what I value in a career (work/life balance, salary, culture, etc) in order to plan for my next move. I am going to set a goal of deciding on my next move either within the firm I am at or others opportunities by January.

**Marriage:** This has been a whirlwind past two weeks. After some early success using ideas from the two books and sidebar posts I read, I have spiraled out of control. Sex was very frequent but I noticed it felt as though she was motivated from fear of my anger from no sex or of us not getting along if she did not engage me sexually, instead of true desire. I attribute this to trying way too much too early when I lack even the most basic understanding of core MRP concepts. I will return this week to core principles/dread, 1-3 and focus hard on the bar (lift) and STFU. Way too many times I found myself explaining how I “felt” instead of realizing my mistakes and STFU, which sunk me each time. After my my early highs crashed and burned, I found myself truly angry and checked out the past few days, trying to avoid my wife entirely and lacking any sex drive. I will focus on returning got the sidebar in earnest and taking my time to digest the materials and STFU.

**Frame:** My frame has improved in that that I can see myself acting when I am doing it, I am truly aware of how I feel when I am doing things, and actively trying to slow down and stay in the moment. I still find myself reacting in stead of being proactive, and genuinely caring way too much what others think and pondering all of the “what ifs.” I am going to mediate more on IDNGAF and return to my MAP in an effort to refocus my frame work and overall goals. If it does not serve my plan, then why do I care? I also am recognizing so many things that I need to let go of. This has been liberating.

**Children:** One huge area of improvement I have noticed is with my children and the mood of the home. When I am calm, present, and proactive instead of reactive, thinking hard about how I treat my children, we flow as a family and the kids and all of us are visibly less stressed. Wife has even remarked how much less stressful mornings and evenings are when I am rising early to set the tone for the day and keeping a calm demeanor for all of us. If this were the only improvement in my life it would be worth it. I am going to focus on being the first one awake and last one down, staying calm, and not letting things undermine the family goals and morale. I am going to keep on the gas here but also continue to mediate on this as it is a huge motivator.",2021-05-26 10:07:04

Delicious_Context_53,"In a recession you see decreased economic productivity, company profits decrease, they lay off workers, who in turn spend less, leading to less economic productivity. The Fed is supposed to step in here by lowering interest rates, which stimulates lending, allowing companies to finance activity and in theory keep workers employed.

Since rates are at 0, the alternative is to directly stimulate spending by sending out stimulus checks. This requires political consensus. Therefore this will not happen. 

We will likely see negative interest rates, which the Fed can do directly and does not require political consensus. This will cause investors to move away from bonds even more, and toward assets like bitcoin. Probably some degree of yield curve control on the treasuries as well, which will weaken the dollar.

There may be punctuations throughout this process where investors pull liquidity and the price crashes, but on the whole I think the narrative for bitcoin gets stronger. As other fiat currencies collapse, citizens of those nations will turn to bitcoin for economic protection. We see this already in African and South American nations.",2021-05-26 11:14:14

broooooskii,"Central bankers around the world are mulling the future of their massive bond-buying programs in a post-pandemic world, knowing that with big balance sheets come big expectations.  
  
Featured in the June/July issue of Bloomberg Markets.Illustrator: Rachell Sumpter  
The Group of Seven developed economies piled on about $7 trillion in debt last year as they spent heavily to fight the pandemic and prop up their economies. Central banks ended up owning much of that new debt, according to Bloomberg Economics.  
  
Even as asset purchases continue, with hundreds of billions of dollars spent each month, officials at the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are among those figuring out how—or if—they can reduce asset piles that have been a mainstay of financial markets for more than a decade.  
  
The problem is that markets have come to expect central banks to use their buying power to smooth over any hint of trouble. Governments may be tempted to lean on monetary authorities to use it to keep borrowing costs low indefinitely. And activists now also call on monetary officials to use their firepower to fight inequality and even climate change. Those disparate expectations add to the unease fueled by economists who for years have warned about the long-term effects of quantitative easing.  
  
“The Fed balance sheet is going to be gigantic for a long time,” says Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman who’s now a Princeton professor. “That worries some people,” he says—but not Blinder himself.  
  
The size of the Fed balance sheet in coming years will largely be determined by Federal Open Market Committee decisions regarding asset purchases and reinvestment policies, the New York Federal Reserve Bank noted in a late May report. Yet the report projects that the balance sheet could rise by 2023 to $9 trillion, equivalent to 39% of gross domestic product. Under a range of scenarios, Fed assets could remain at that level through 2030 or drop as low as $6.6 trillion.    
  
QUANTITATIVE-EASING TOOLS have been a welcome boon to ­monetary institutions faced with policy rates already near or below zero. But they’ve also magnified the political profile of central banks, leaving them more exposed to entanglement in fiscal policy—or the perception that they could be.  
  
So-called fiscal dominance—in which central banks are prevented from acting on their inflation mandates for fear of harming the government’s finances—is the issue. It’s associated with a ­spectrum of concerns, ranging from the erosion of independence, with the possibility of monetary officials keeping policy too loose and unleashing inflation, to a regime change in which government borrowing is monetized, with central banks buying debt directly or agreeing to buy a certain amount.  
  
How far the situation has come is starkly visible in Europe. Where once the mere purchase of debt of euro-area nations on secondary markets unleashed accusations of illegal monetary financing, high-­ranking politicians in Italy and France have in recent months called for the bonds on the European Central Bank’s balance sheet to be canceled or turned into “perpetual” bonds that never get paid back.  
  
The idea that government debt has to be honored is coming under attack. “We’re headed toward this sort of Modern Monetary Theory regime where the debt and free money supposedly have no consequences,” says Charles Plosser, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, who’s now a fellow at the Hoover Institution. “What I worry about ultimately is the politicization of the central bank.”  
  
The concern is about a specific set of circumstances: With such a large balance sheet, a central bank such as the Bank of Japan, the Fed, or the ECB is the government’s buyer-in-chief. Indirectly, the monetary authority controls the government’s cost of borrowing. The current debates about so-called yield-curve control—buying that targets a specific yield at a given tenor—only underline this fact.  
  
But if inflation comes along, the central bank governor is in a pickle. Raise rates, and the government screams. Keep them low, and you prove that your independence—and credibility to fight inflation—has gone.  
  
The straightforward way to get out of this dilemma is to reduce the size of debt holdings as quickly as possible. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey hinted last year that he may favor aggressive shrinkage also because it could create more room to maneuver in a future emergency.  
  
But in 2013, after the U.S. had come out of the crisis sparked by the subprime meltdown, the Fed signaled an attempt to “taper” its own balance sheet, leading to an immediate spike in bond yields and global market turmoil. Central bankers are wary of doing the same again. Fed officials say there’s no need to discuss a change in the pace of bond-buying until much more progress has been made on their employment and inflation goals. Investors are laser-focused on when that moment might come.  
  
The lesson from the Bank of Japan, which has advanced further in the direction of fiscal dominance than its peers, seems to be that any attempt to wind down the debt holdings of today could take a generation or more. “The BOJ will have to do it very, very slowly, hoping no one will notice that’s what it is doing,” says Richard Koo, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo and a former adviser to Japanese prime ministers. “If they do it very carefully over, say, 20 to 30 years, they may be able to bring the balance sheet back to something normal.”  
  
Quantitative easing has been part of the monetary toolkit for so long now that the definition of “normal” has changed. Where once the Fed maintained a “lean” balance sheet just greater than the value of bank notes issued, there’s little chance of a return to that. There are various reasons why central bankers will want to retain at least some of their current holdings indefinitely, from preserving their ability to intervene to smooth market functioning to helping the conduct of monetary policy.  
  
To do so, central bankers may need to prove that they’re not captured by their finance ministries and that, when inflation returns, they can react. Vitor Constancio, ECB vice president until 2018, argues the fears about fiscal dominance are “wishful thinking” by market investors, a narrative that pressures the central bank to keep policy loose indefinitely.  
  
“When inflation normalizes in a consistent way, central banks will start reducing the size of their balance sheets,” Constancio says. “I have no doubt about that.”",2021-05-26 20:11:10

whyrat,"&gt; Not sure what whyrat thinks of this but boring_pencil the short and simple answer is that it does not matter, they both have the same effect. 

I think it maters based on the relative current balance between debt and tax revenue.  If debt is high and tax revenue low, it's ""better"" to finance through higher tax revenue.  If Tax revenue is high and debt is low it's ""better"" to finance new spending through debt.

Also, the business cycle matters. Raising taxes during a recession period has different growth implications than during an expansion period.

Remember it's a trade-off. The marginal costs depend on the level.  Maybe it's best to think of it in the same terms with the isoquant curve: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/isoquantcurve.asp

When one form of financing spending is more prevalent than the other, the marginal cost/benefit shifts in favor of the method that's less represented. The answer for which is more efficient depends on where you currently are on the curve.",2021-05-26 23:38:45

Econophysicist1,"Define too good to be true. If an algo does like 1000x in a year probably you have some look forward leak. What you should always do is the following. Get a table of all your trades and the prices the use this table to do the calculation of your cumulative growth and compare it with the cumulative growth curve your backtest produces. If the 2 match, then check one by one the prices for these stocks during that day using independent data sources (like yahoo finance or google charts). It is often one of the best ways to catch some error.   
Another thing to try is to change your parameters slowly and see how your cumulative curve changes. If the final gain changes slowly relative to the parameter change then probably you don't have an error but if you lose immediately alpha probably you do.

An MHA provides a large alumni network in healthcare specifically. An MBA has people in all industries so your ties to healthcare might be weaker. I’m at VCU and they have fellowship/residencies ties all over which is a huge advantage in looking for those. 

Another thought is that all of my finance, accounting, strategy, management, etc courses are specific to healthcare where an MBA may give you a great base but there will be a learning curve to learn the healthcare side of things.

stratagizer,"Let me start by saying that I agree 100% that trickle down economics do not work. I studied economics. In particular, I spent a lot of time trying to justify my very conservative upbringing in the face of the reality.

That said, saying ""it's just common sense"", is either disingenuous, short-sighted, or misinformed.

Especially in the 70s and 80s, there was serious economic literature showing that cutting taxes and getting the government out of the way of economic activity was the way to go. The most common one is the now debunked Laffer Curve. There's a lot more to it, but at its heart the concept is that if the government takes less money from every transaction, there will be more transactions occurring in the marketplace so in the long-run the government will collect MORE revenue. Its predicated on the assumption that the free market is better at allocating resources than government. This is an entire debate that, IMHO, does not have a solved answer.

Now, to your other point, ""we'll if we let this rich guy keep this extra $1M, why would be spend it?"" The whole system of capitalism is based on the idea that everyone is going to try and make the most return on their money that they can. This is basic human behavior. Unless he keeps it under his mattress, it IS going to be used. Even if he puts it in his bank account, great! The bank has an extra $1M in assets that it can use to loan out to start/build businesses. This will in turn create jobs that will create a feedback loop of wealth creation. And based on the historical evidence and research of the time, it made sense. The best returns for your money was to invest in Capital, creating jobs, kicking off the wealth cycle.

Here is where my personal research shows the problem. Yes, historically that was the best return for your money. But around the 80s is when we start to see widespread use of some of the more complex financial tools we have now (The Big Short has a couple good explanations). Now, it was starting to become better to invest you money in these schemes. Now the feedback loops are within financial and investing circles, not the normal banking system. Money makes money based on money not tangible items. So instead of pushing money down it all stays within the high finance world. This is what we are seeing at a Macro-level with the rich getting richer faster the richer you are.",2021-05-29 00:36:29

thomgloams,"This is an excellent follow-up. I thank you.  
I did gather that you and others were brave enough to adopt very early as far as ETH (and others I assume). Buy and HODL I've come along way with.

My question (rant really) was more about the finance concepts that to me, are difficult to grasp regardless of the base money, whether fiat or crypto.

You mention LedgerX - Are you referring to the hardware wallet? I can't imagine otherwise but I use a Nano X as well but I'm unaware of anything regarding SEC regulation and fully insured? Could you elaborate on this?

Celsius - I've been trying to get A Cel , let alone Celcius as a platform to work for me but after completing KYC and the entire verification process i was informed that it's not available to use in the US.  I'm aware of methods available to handle the general "" no US "" aspect of certain platforms but not when KYC is in use.  So I can't do anything with Celcius. Did I miss anything? 

- General advanced concepts like OTM calls and other options, leverage, etc. I get that these methods are universal and need to be studied one way or another but I don't have these options offered to me on the exchanges I use (unfort I'm forced to use only Coinbase Pro and Gemini Trader. No others "" technically "" work where I live) I'm still curious where one would get the options for options on crypto.

Finally, I do get that it takes money to make money unless you have either time or lots of startup capital on your side. I'm not a moonshot hunting noob, but I wasn't early either. I have my stack but a mouse could easily see over it. Unless I'm missing something it seems pointless to do anything but buy more when I can and HODL until the stack is stackable. Because even if I could get a cumulative 50% return in a year, a few grand becomes just a bit more in a year.  Law of large numbers doesn't apply to me unfortunately.  
I love the compound interest curve, but from my calculations it seems that it really only begins to deviate from linear growth after about 10 years. And really takes off after 20.  Time which I do not have. 

I guess the question is, is DeFi and financial wizardry worth it under 10k or should my focus be just stacking and holding until decimals become as valuable as whole numbers are today?

ShaughnDBL,"That's *exactly* what I think happened.

If you look at the big banks' activity in the past 5 months they've been shrinking their businesses and/or putting on the biggest bond sales in the history of finance. One after the other. Hedge funds have been rupturing. This tells me they're hungry for cold cash. They're running the repo market into the red already, on their way to completely inverting the yield curve, so they're looking elsewhere. Cripped-0 doesn't require any reporting, so it's the perfect place for their preferred, sheisty reindeer games and parlor tricks in terms of scraping together a couple bucks on the sly.

In other words, they've shown their motivation for cash, there's no one else as motivated or capable to do what's happened to cripped-0, and we know they're overleveraged in many of their positions without the cash on hand to cover them as required by the new audit rules.

t00mietum,"It's not a matter of a bad actor(s) ""killing"" bitcoin. At least, not in my bet-upon scenario. It's simply a matter of it dying in total, utter, whimpering archaic irrelevancy. Mining farms amortizing out of mining (or transitioning to other distributed GPU work that isn't crypto-related - as I am myself). ""Market cap"" slowly withering. People just, you know...moving on. As we tend to do. (While it could be, I seriously doubt it would be a sudden, catastrophic crash that brings down the rest of crypto and the stock market too.)

People had millions invested in Prodigy and CompuServe. Then the internet came (technically had already been there), and yet those services kept going strong. But slowly, eventually they became irrelevant. Investors looked elsewhere. They couldn't evolve. *Massive* sums of capital evaporated, but the economy not only kept going, but grew with the potential of the superior replacement.

The same happened, slowly, with steam-powered locomotives and shipping, which dominated world commerce.

The point is not that things change and old tech dies. It's that when the new tech comes along that eventually kills the old, few recognize it for what it is initially. (In part because that's not always even possible.) But like Roger's bell curve, some are left defending the undefendable long after it's obvious, for no good reason. Is that you? (I don't know. Maybe? Maybe not. I'm not the expert - or rather the oracle - to say.)

Crypocurrency represents the quickening of the tech lifecycle on steroids, but in a space we sometimes think of as slow and conservative. (Finance and investing.) That creates massive social and individual cognitive dissonance. Bitcoin was a seismic tech revolution to put it mildly. But is now a coughing, wheezing, sputtering Model T with no intrinsic worth or practical value - compared to even just LTC, XMR, or ETH - other than people saying it's ""digital gold"" with self-satisfaction, as if that meant anything whatsoever.

But again, that's just my opinion. My long-term bet. I'm bach'in it this weekend and for some reason find this a fun thing to do with my rare night off :-D. I won't change your mind. If anything I'm just seeing if I can argue myself out of a position. This is all just pointless mental masturbation.

Either way, this will be my last cycle in BTC. I could *easily* miss more bull runs and bear opportunities. For sure. But I'd rather invest that brainpower investing in the future of crypto, not the past.

(But if bitcoin does wind up *massively* keeping up, ship of theseus style - eventually becoming something utterly different but with the same name and - like ETH 2.0, remembering the old coins and tx history on a shard - then of course I'd consider getting back in. Lose the original value of my current investment? Yes. That's the nature of ""opportunity cost"", and wouldn't necessarily be a net loss, portfolio-wise.)

rdtrowz,"As u/UnearnedConfident has mentioned, at your age, the best investment is in yourself. Get a good education and pick up a skill you can sell. Continue to develop this skill as this will mainly how you earn money and capital to invest (for most people anyway). More than this, take this time to get more educated on other topics on financial planning - learn to have a budget, emergency cash, manage debt and loans, credit cards, develop your credit, taxes, retirement accounts, get health insured, etc. Investing your money should come after you've got all these fundamentals right.

Dave Ramsay is a good starting point to get these fundamentals, but I''ve heard his stuff on investing are not all that great (don't quote me!). Avoid the Rich Dad Poor Dad book, I'll summarize it for you in one sentence - Buy assets that generate wealth, avoid assets that don't. The entire book goes on and on about this concept and doesn't really teach you anything else that is meaningful. It felt like I was waiting and waiting for a reveal that did not come even as I ended the book.

The PersonalFinance sub wiki has really good general guide on what to focus on for people of various age groups: [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/teachme](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/teachme).

Once you've got the fundamentals set, you can start learning about investment styles and ones that suit you. I highly recommend to look into indexing.

Some commonly and highly recommended books are:

* Simple Path to Wealth by J Collins - Great starting point on most of the fundamentals I talked about.
* The Richest Man in Babylon by Samuel Clason - Very interesting take on personal finance.
* If You Can: How Millennials Can Get Rich Slowly by William J Bernstein - Very short read and introduction to the concept of indexing and investing in general. It's only 15 pages long and it's free! However, it should be taken more as a guide to learning more. In the book, the author also recommends other books to read further on various topics.
* The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John C Bogle - This is all about indexing I spoke about. Mr Bogle is very very highly regarded in some subsections of the investing community (they've even named themselves after him, Bogleheads, and there's a subreddit that follows his investing principles!).

This should more or less get you started on good grounds. There's a lot to learn but you getting started at 16 is way ahead of the curve. I wish I had this foresight and discipline at your age. Keep it up and keep going, good luck!",2021-06-01 10:56:30

machinegunkisses,"Thanks for your thoughts. It sounds like you see two groups, call them ""growth"" investors (really, pump and dump shops and other speculators) and ""value"" investors (people buying for long term; coin's value determined by its capability). If so, I agree with that assessment.

Personally, I think we're in a crypto bubble, which is why the former group dominates right now. I also think trying to make money like this is a fool's errand: The value of the coins is just what someone else is willing to pay for them, so you have to be ahead of the curve almost all the time to get in and out early. Me, I don't have time for that amount of work, but, I'm sure there're traders who are regularly successful.

I'm interested in the long run value proposition of cryptos, which I think will be determined by their capabilities. It's why I think Bitcoin will fall by the wayside (or just stagnate), because it doesn't really offer anything of value. 

We'll see about smart contracts, but I'm not totally convinced that there's value in decentralizing finance. There could also be a killer app that just hasn't happened, yet.",2021-06-01 14:34:37

iKickdaBass,"&gt; What about the fact that QE is not decreasing any time soon. Just like you said that banks have too much cash and the net effect of that is nil. Additional monetization of bonds is potentially harmful.

If the net affect of it is nil, how is it potentially harmful?

&gt;Also, what about the infrastructure bill and the upcoming govt budget? Increased govt spending could also play a role in driving up inflation.

Government spending increase both demand for goods and shifts the supply curve to meet those demands. The new equilibrium price should be close to the previous one. Issuing bonds to finance infrastructure projects puts excess cash to use. Unlike in normal economic conditions where there may not be excess cash, there is a demand for bonds now because cash is paying so little interest. And with interest rates so low now, it makes a lot of sense to invest in infrastructure projects because a portion of that government spending comes back in the form of more tax revenue to pay the interest on the infrastructure projects.

&gt;Foreign investors have been seeking US Treasury bonds which is also devaluing the dollar. 

Foreign investors seeking US treasuries would not devalue the dollar. Foreign investors need to buy dollars first and then buy the US treasuries with those dollars. The dollar has been declining and interest rates increasing due to selling bonds and using those dollars to  buy other foreign currencies.  

&gt;US being a net importer is thus paying more for the same goods. How will that correct?

The US has been a net importer for a very long time. In times of a strong dollar, those goods are cheaper. In times of a weak dollar, those goods become more expensive. This makes domestically made projects more competitive, both in the US and abroad. Exports increase with a weak dollar and thus ultimately strengthen the dollar and the system self corrects.",2021-06-02 07:02:36

NotTooDeep,"Even better, your situation is!

You have a great exit strategy from this situation; it's get another job at a company with a global presence but better management. 50 direct reports is a stinker, and you really can't do much more than correct admin errors with that volume. And half of them in India? If that's a typical outsourcing arrangement, then you can't do much career development with them. So you're only really managing the careers of 25 people.

But you will be perceived by other companies as somewhat of a superwoman with this on your resume. ""If she can do that, imagine what she can do on our project with 25 resources.""  They'll give you an administrative assistant and more money. I saw this happen in the finance industry. A manager was hired away from a big telecom into a big brokerage and spent her days wearing Italian sport coats to planning meetings. The project managers and technical managers reported to her, but that was it. Different industries view project teams in different ways. Different industries view their org charts somewhere between a necessary evil and a prideful powerpoint slide that shows what a great C-level person they are. 

You're in that part of the career growth curve that is like calculus classes for pre-med students. Doctors don't do much math in real practice, but the math classes serve as filters to ensure only the best pre-med students make it into med school. 

Tradeoffs: do you want to be a Director or VP that hires and fires people like you, and pushes them like you're being pushed?  Do you want to work with a smaller team in fewer time zones? Do you want to live in your current city? Do you want to work at a startup, with all the fun and uncertainty that entails? Do you want to stay in the same industry?

Management skills are easily transferred to different industries in some circumstances, especially in IT. You really do need to have a handle on what your direct reports actually do, but don't need to be able to do their jobs yourself in IT.

Embrace the kid interruptions; they're a blessing in disguise. 

Remote work is much more common because of the pandemic. You are in a time when finding your next gig can be as simple as asking google, ""remote jobs &lt;your job title and a detail or two&gt;"". I started a new job yesterday and that's how I found it.

Observations: stock options at startups are not real. Not until they have an IPO or are acquired. The vast majority of startups never have either of these events.

infant_ape,"Have to debunk one element of this: the geometric mean theory.  

There was a post here a few months back where someone applied the ""geometric mean"" to the phenomenon of people selling on the way up and down (with very few selling at the actual peak) and they came up with some pretty crazy numbers, such as:

*1k per share price total payout would be $33,525,000,000 @ 447 per share (Geometric Mean)*  
*5k per share price total payout would be $75,000,000,000 @ 1000 per share (Geometric Mean)*  
*10k per share price total payout would be $106,050,000,000 @ 1414 per share (Geometric Mean)*  
*42k per share price total payout would be $217,350,000,000 @ 2898 per share (Geometric Mean)*  
*69k per share price total payout would be $278,550,000,000 @ 3714 per share (Geometric Mean)*  
*100k per share price total payout would be $335,400,000,000 @ 4472 per share (Geometric Mean)*  
*500k per share price total payout would be $750,000,000,000 @ 10000 per share (Geometric Mean)*  
*1m per share price total payout would be $1,060,650,000,000 @ 14142 per share (Geometric Mean)*  
*2m per share price total payout would be $1,500,000,000,000 @ 20000 per share (Geometric Mean)*  
*20m per share price total payout would be $4,743,375,000,000 @ 63245 per share (Geometric Mean)*

SO... at $1,000,000/share... this guy thinks the average price to buy-to-cover (number of shares was hypothetical based on suspected SI) for hedgies will only be $14k and change.  

Now while I'm not a finance formula guy, i DO understand the concept of a bell curve as it applies to an average, and such a low number didn't make sense to me.  But hey, again- I'm not a finance guy, so maybe I'm missing something.

BUT... another ape way wrinklier than me jumped in and said ""uh, that's not how geometric means work; they aren't meant to find averages across a bell curve.""  And he went on to explain how geometric means ARE meant to be used to calculate RETURNS, not an average share price.  Here is a pretty clear explanation:

**Understanding the Geometric Mean**  
**In Growth Rates**  
The geometric mean is used in finance to calculate average growth rates and is referred to as the compounded annual growth rate. Consider a stock that grows by 10% in year one, declines by 20% in year two, and then grows by 30% in year three. The geometric mean of the growth rate is calculated as follows:  
((1+0.1)\*(1-0.2)\*(1+0.3))\^(1/3) = 0.046 or 4.6% annually.

SO... as you can see... there is NO application to finding what increasing and decreasing price averages would be across a sell-off on the way up and down during a squeeze.  WOuld there be SOME sort of average price?  Id imagine yes, what with inevitable paper hands and institutional selling-off.  But I imagine that, with apes holding... the average price hedgies pay will be be a far higher average than the geo-mean ape stated above. 

That's all I got.  Peace.  And Hodl.

TL;DR- the geometric mean will not be of any help to apes during a squeeze, so stop spreading it as a concept that will work in our favor.  Other things will, but not this.",2021-06-02 23:37:36
harschso,"Got into a role straight out of uni heavily involving modelling (infra, energy, project finance type of models). The first few months were a steep learning curve, writing macros to optimise models, modelling debt sculpting etc

First I enjoyed it because it was challenging and you get to design mechanisms to translate the client’s requests in the most concise and comprehensive manner as possible. Your logic needs to be easily understood by others, flexible and accurate.

Day to day: Like for any job, there are more thrilling parts to others depending on what’s needed. But as you progress you get more and more into the conceptual part, writing emails explaining your numbers or tackling issues of how things should be modelled.

At some point modelling becomes like writing, the most important is the message you convey/ results you obtain. So I’d say happiness would be more in finding satisfaction in the sector/industry that you are working in. 

When the numbers are not right, you go to the source and re trace the calculations to identify the error.

shadeneeder4202,"&gt;OP is confusing that with government bond rates. It’s a classic case of people getting the bond market rate mixed up with Central Bank overnight rates after reading a Buzzfeed article on monetary policy. Those rates are supposed to be related, but Central Banks can play this game for a very long time. I encourage OP to read up on yield curve control and other methods Central Banks can use to also control bond rates too.

Yes I do know, I have a Masters in this subject and am employed practicing it. Generally fixed-rate mortgage rates are determined based on GoC bond yields (5-year bond determines 5-year mortgage). Variable rate mortgages depend on the BoC's overnight rate. 

There is a linkage in that bond yields depend on the expected trajectory of the BoC's overnight rate. This is more true the shorter the bond's term. For instance, a 2-year bond depends heavily on the expected movement of the BoC's overnight rate. So for instance, if the BoC states they're going to keep the overnight rate at 0.5% for two years and the market believes them the 2-year bond yield will be 0.5%. But at the other end of the spectrum for a 30-year bond the yield is determined by expected economic growth, inflation and the credit worthiness of the country. Who does the determination? Fixed income investors in the City and Wall Street. 

What's terrifying is I'm almost certain neither our Prime Minister nor Finance Minister understand how this all ties together. How can you tell? Their comments around Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) and bond yields being low in the middle of COVID.

MMT's main tenant is that a government which borrows in its own currency cannot default. As a result, government borrowing is only limited by inflation and when you're in a zero rate environment with a demand shortage government borrowing is a ""free lunch"". This is all true but it's incomplete. The ""limited by inflation"" tenant is incredibly important but tends to be down-played. Currently the GoC funds its day-to-day operations through bond sales which on a look-through basis go to both the BoC and bond investors. The BoC buying bonds is what is known as ""monetizing"" the debt, which gets its name from the BoC printing money to purchase bonds. That is totally fine when economy wide supply outstrips demand. Your purchases will stimulate demand, and because there's a demand gap there will be no inflation. 

But if and when the economy is running at full capacity you will start to see inflation from this monetization. At this point the monetization needs to stop to prevent an inflationary spiral. The GoC is then forced to sell many more bonds to actual investors. This will increase bond yields driving up the rates on fixed-rate mortgages.  The BoC will likely be forced to increase its overnight rate as well to keep inflation under control. Now here comes the fallacy that I keep seeing on this sub about how the BoC would never do that, it would send the government and over-levered homeowners into a world of hurt. *They have no choice*. Inflation is a spiral, if you don't raise rates it will drive down the currency, raising the cost of imports, increasing inflation. Anyone who thinks the BoC will keep rates low during a period of rising inflation and bond yields is playing a very dangerous game.",2021-06-03 21:27:33

Darekh87,"It all depends on your situation. If you'd like to live outside your family home and earn a living wage- avoid internships and schemes as they won't pay enough to support yourself under the guise of training, etc. 

If you do live with your family and are happy to continue so, those schemes will provide you with a SOLID training and introduction into the job. 

I can only speak for myself and my life experience. I've worked in finance for the past 10ish years, it is a field of choice for me and as a job it's good enough. I've never done any education in the direction of finance, actually I'm only starting AAT levels 3 and 4 this year (purely just to get a higher paying job). I am what they call a victim of experience. Done every branch of finance, learned on the job and have to say I wouldn't have it any other way- but it's me. I work alongside people who are on apprenticeship schemes, etc. and even tho my workplace offered to pay for whatever I want as long as I will enroll in such a scheme (without it affecting my salary) they all sound like a straight up nightmare to me. Regular calls with a ""talent coach"", catch ups, theory, blah blah blah. I'm used to learning on the job and even tho it's always been a steep learning curve with high stress moments it's the style I prefer. But at my age maybe it's just the fact that I refuse to follow a heavily academic route. If you think that's the way for you tho I'd apply for entry level jobs or admin jobs- those get your foot through the door and later on offer lateral moves into ""proper"" finance within the company. I myself moved to finance from a night shift in a hotel. It involved a lot of audit work and when a finance position opened up my work was appreciated by the FC and I was given a chance. A ""hands- on"" approach also allowed me some better start in the salary area, which was important to me as I am an EU citizen living here by myself so I needed the dough to support myself and save. 

Now, the other side of the coin. If you're OK living at home on an apprentice salary- that's the way to go if your ambition is a Finance Manager/ Financial Controller position still your 20s. Those programs/ schemes provide the certification which will push you forward on the ladder. I have to admit I'm a person who never wanted to be THE BOSS. Mid level managent around 30something k a year is my lifestyle. Come to work, do the job, leave - don't believe in overtime, don't belive in ""we're a family here""- no we're not- it's a job, pay me and leave me alone. So my approach to my career provided me with exactly that- slow but steady salary raises and vastly stress- free jobs. Is there a glass ceiling? Yes, because I do not have the fabled ""ambition"" to progress- don't feel the need to. BUT if you do, and there's nothing wrong with that- if you want it fast- I think sacrificing some years to stay at home and use the schemes to provide you with the necessary papers is worth it. 1 of my current managers is 7 years my junior - and bless her, she's a great boss. I can see she's happy in her position and proud of the hard work she put in in her early 20s. 

So, the question is- what do you think you want from life at this moment? It's not a fair question, because the answer will change many-a times, but all you can do is follow your gut while you find yourself in the current circumstances. 

Get a full time entry level job or follow a more academic/ apprenticeship route..... up to you. 

Good Luck!",2021-06-05 03:53:14
obrian_99,"Story of a dead end team: a team I know have been running more than 5 years now, doing purely quant stuff, mostly machine learning, back test curve fitting. All the guys have backgrounds in stats, math, physics, no finance. 

Performance wise, they've been shitty. Even in the winning years, they've never outperformed the SPX, or even M2 delta. But they're determined to ""never give up""... 

They took me on as an advisor for a while, and the main mistake I noticed was that while the trades were quantitative in nature, their risk management was not. It was all discretionary when it came to position sizing, which trades to put on, or stop; and none of them ever dug deep into why a trade made or lost money. 

So my main advice to you: regardless of how you put trades on. Have an objective, quantitative plan for risk management, i.e. position reduction. When things get stressful, it's very difficult to make optimal decisions quickly on your feet.",2021-06-05 05:53:41
NewCow,"i'm aware of how delta hedging works. what you're describing sounds a little like max pain theory, which fails once you understand MM mechanics better. there are a few things you're misunderstanding.

volume alone doesn't tell you much because you don't know what types of orders those are (buy to open, buy to close, sell to open, sell to close). what matters is open interest at the end of the day, which you don't know either since it is calculated at the end of each day.

delta hedging is a dynamic process, so the MM is continuously adjusting their overall stock + options positions to get as close to aggregate 0 delta as possible. in other words, the MM has been hedging this entire time and does not need to go out at the last minute to buy more shares to fulfill their short call obligations, because they've already been accumulating the necessary inventory (since delta approaches 1 for an ITM option as it approaches expiration). the purpose of delta hedging is to eliminate directional risk, so the MM has no preference of where the stock goes since he/she is hedged already, the MM makes money on volume and the bid/ask spread.

gamma refers to delta's rate of change, and gamma rises as a stock approaches the strike and declines as the option moves deeper into the money (google ""options gamma curve""). consider an OTM call with 0.4 delta. as the stock goes up and approaches the strike, gamma kicks in and delta begins to accelerate, forcing the MM to buy more and more shares to hedge, then once the call is ITM and has a delta of around 0.6, gamma declines and delta starts to decelerate. gamma squeezes have contributed to volatility in these meme stocks since WSB traders buy a lot of OTM weeklies, but a gamma squeeze has no bearing at expiration because again, the MM is already fully hedged at expiration and is not going out to buy stock at the last minute.

hope that helps.

ethereum88,"TL;DR

Curve Finance is a decentralized exchange (DEX) running on Ethereum. It's specifically designed for swapping between stablecoins. All you need is an Ethereum wallet, some funds, and you can swap different stablecoins with low fees and slippage.

Other than swapping, one can also deposit stablecoins for interest. (Currently the interest rate on Curve Polygon is like \~5% + 17% in MATIC which is unparalleled.)

The only downside is its interface, which is quite beginner-unfriendly and looks like MS-DOS.",2021-06-05 15:33:07

&gt; Curve Finance is an automated market maker protocol designed for swapping between stablecoins with low fees and slippage. Curve is one of the best ways to swap between different tokenized versions of Bitcoin, such as WBTC, renBTC, and sBTC.At the time of writing, there are 17 Curve pools available to swap between many different stablecoins and assets. Similarly to SushiSwap and Uniswap, Curve Finance also has a high profile hard fork - Swerve Finance.

&gt; Curve DAO token stands among the few DeFi tokens that have seen a strong recovery over the past two weeks due to reduced Ethereum gas fees, the launch of Convex Finance and the DeFi sector beginning to find a bottom. Curve Finance and the wider DeFi ecosystem could also be benefitting from the sharp decline in gas fees on the Ethereum network, which had previously priced out many retail traders from performing the simple approval and confirmation transactions required to stake and claim earnings from DeFi protocols. Lower fees have allowed a wider range of users to re-engage with their favorite DeFi protocols, and Curve has been a significant beneficiary of this development.

Mediocre-Diamond9902,"Econ Major here, and I've taken all of these classes except for ECMT 475.

Econ 311 is very good for an introduction to the money and banking system. It focuses more on the theory and explaining how money is used in the financial system, focusing on how it is exchanged, it is much more theory and explanation based. Econ 445 on the other hand, goes into the mathematical calculations for portfolio management through investments in stocks, bonds, options, and futures, as well as calculating and managing risk. Econ 445 is very stats heavy, and for many (including myself) that made it quite difficult. 

I took Econ 311 in the fall and then Econ 445 the next semester, and I would recommend doing that if you are able, I think 311 provides a good background before you get into the nitty gritty stuff in 445. I will say that for both classes, the professors are pretty great. I personally liked Edwardson better, who teaches 311, I love the way he lectures, its so laid back and allowed me to learn the content better. Jansen is a good guy, and he does interesting work at the Econ Research Center, but sometimes his lectures on the content can be shallow, leaving you unable to complete the homework, so just know you might be spending time learning on your own. Again, if you have a stronger background in Stats or finance in general, you should be fine. Neither of them try to trick you or have extremely difficult exams, and Jansen offered a curve when the class didn't do so hot on the final, so they aren't looking to destroy your grade.

&amp;#x200B;

As for ECMT classes, I haven't taken Stat 211 as another poster said, but 461 is basically learning how to use Excel and how to manipulate economic data. The capstone is a research paper. If you take it with Schulman (which is likely, and he is awesome), he provides you with a couple different options of data sets based on what you are interested in (for example, when I took it, there was alcohol sales at the beginning of the pandemic in each texas county, NCAA baseball stats, finance data, and high school sat scores) and there would be data on a bunch of variables in each set, and then you would pick a couple variables you want, and then you would form some hypothesis and run your data set through the tests he teaches in class (regression, ANOVA, t-tests, f-tests, etc) and then write your paper about your conclusions.

MiguelChina,"Farming is a little complicated if you haven't done if before and not always advised until you have taken the time to learn about it. But, a quick run down from my understanding:

When you enter a farm, you are providing liquidity to the pool. So you might add liquidity into a FEG pool for example: You add $1,000 worth of FEG and $1,000 worth of another coin (most likely a stable coin or eth). There a many pairs depending on the farms available. Because your liquidity is in the farm's pool, you will be rewarded with a % of the total rewards from that farm's pool. So, if you have add 1% of the total pool, than you get 1% of the total rewards. 

The rewards come from fees from trading on that pair, so a farm (Sushi, Curve, Polycat, etc.) might reward the pool with .25% on every transaction on that pair (of what you would get 1% because of the liquidity you have added to the pool). 

Also, people might take a loan from the farm and depending on how it is setup (mostly in stable coins), that person will have to pay back the loan with interest, so the farm gets interest payments (like a bank). 

The really high ARP makes this seem really good, but it has downsides depending on the farm, there is almost always entry and exit fees, which you have to pay with the liquidity you are providing, transferring liquidity also requires gas (which can get expensive) and some require time locks (which means you can't access your liquidity for a time period). Farms can also rug pull (@RugSteemer on twitter) is a good source to check before entering a farm/pool. 

If you are new to farming, I would suggest doing some research or starting with a very small amount of money until you get a better idea of how it all works. This is just my understanding, I'm also new to farming, and so you should DYOR before starting with farming.

Also, if this explanation is wrong please call me out, so I can also understand it better.

vuduchyld,"I agree with those below who say zoom out just a little bit.  

Don't consider me a credible source on this, but I think I read somewhere that some of the team recently had some lockups expire, which may have put quite a few MATIC in play on exchanges and generated some available supply.  May not be true.  I can't find that or cite it.  But it may be true...click on the 1-month view here: [https://www.viewbase.com/coin/matic-network](https://www.viewbase.com/coin/matic-network)

But that is short term.  As for the L2/DeFi issue, I think Polygon will do well with retail DeFi.  Institutions are definitely going to be more interested by the security of Arbitrum/Optimism, but if BSC proved one thing, it's that there is a ton of retail demand for inexpensive and fast DeFi.  I tend to believe that even with L2s, 2.0, and everything we know is coming, scaling will be an issue for quite some time.  

I actually like some of the DeFi options on Polygon.  One can choose established players, such as Aave and Curve.  Unlike Alpha or 1Inch, they never went to BSC.  This gives Polygon at least a little bit of legitimacy.  Those teams are really fucking good and smart.  There are also some novel options available.  Mai Finance is at least prima facie similar to MakerDAO.  You can collateralize MATIC, borrow a MiMATIC stablecoin, and use that to farm or buy more crypto.  

I'm not fixing to sell off ETH for MATIC.  (Maybe Bitcoin, though!)  ETH wears the crown.  I deployed a bit of new capital to BSC back in February, though, and I am glad I did.  I've since deployed a bit more new capital and re-deployed BSC capital to MATIC.  If nothing else, it's a worthwhile testnet.  I'm a bit of an experiential learner, and I like being able to move in (AND OUT) of positions with some capital efficiency.",2021-06-07 01:04:46
vuduchyld,"I can't in all good conscience recommend these, because I don't know enough about them, really.  I'm just kind of screwing around with a little bit of capital, because that's how I learn.  DYOR DYOR please please DYOR!

* Both Aave and Curve are on Polygon.  I haven't looked at all the offerings in a while, but as I recall, there was a Polygon option that looked like 3Crv with 5-6% returns on your stables plus 15-20% returns in WMATIC.
* Mai Finance is similar, I think, to MakerDAO.  You can deposit MATIC into a vault, then borrow a MiMATIC stablecoin.  They have a few farming options that allow you to earn the QiDAO token, Qi.  That Qi token has recently had a run up in price from around 50 cents to around 80 cents, so that farming reward ends up being pretty substantial.  You can pool MiMATIC/USDC for farming pure stables to Qi or MiMATIC/Qi.
* My favorite aggregator is Adamant Finance.  I'm looking at their website right now, and it seems too good to be true...SO IT PROBABLY IS.  The rewards on stables are outrageously high.  I've got a couple of different stable combos running, including FRAX/USDC on Sushi and DAI/USDC on QuickSwap.
* Maybe somebody like u/LogrisTheBard can tell me what I'm missing, here, but Adamant TVL has jumped from under $100mm to about $130mm in maybe 48 hours.  Keep in mind...some of the rewards come from their ADDY token (not all...and it depends on the pool).  But the market cap of the token is less than $20mm.  They show monthly profits to stakers of the token at more than $4mm.  EDIT: and like the Qi token, the ADDY token has run pretty wild the last 48 hours...up from $34 to $57.
* So market cap to TVL is an absurdly low 0.15...and even assuming no growth in TVL or profits, they would be generating $50mm per year in profits that get paid to $19mm worth of hodlers....so 2.5x cash flow to cap?  How could that even be true in this universe?  Of course, the ADDY token, like the Qi token, has jumped from $34 to $57 just over the course of this weekend, so maybe it's true and people are catching on to it?

DYOR, DYOR, DYOR.  I don't think Curve is going to be rugging you.  Adamant has an audit, at least, but that shit ain't worth much judging by all the BSC rugs lately.

That being said, as someone said below the vault should:

1. Convert 1/2 of your Eth to yvBoost (which is CRV locked permanently in Curve protocol)
2. Stake yvBOOST in the yvBOOST-ETH SLP on SushiSwap for SUSHI rewards
3. Deposits this SLP into the yvBOOST-ETH pJar on Pickle Finance for PICKLE rewards.

Key-Night-3736,"OP here. This is my curiousity. These corporations don't care about actual public sentiment, per se, as much as backlash beyond the point that they can PR it away. In today's infantilish hyper sensitivity to anyone being even 'offended' by literally anything, they are just getting ahead of the curve PR wise, while in fact seeing the numbers on their ledgers reflect the facts that THEIR customer base IS more diverse ethnically than ever, and will continue to be. And they are ALOT more sensitive, but seemingly about the more superficial aspects, while the flagrant abuses of corporate power go unchecked in plain view, while they make a commercial with woke content, or whatever. And that's enough for their critics! Not mocking your assertion, it IS remarkable their stance, which itself is the bigger shame.

Unlike Republican adherents, banks deal in the real world they exist in, not some idealized fantasy throwback to a Norman Rockwell world that never fucking even existed. They don't choose the demographics, they simply do business with the customers that ARE. As for their fading prejudices, they are just getting out of their own way, and with the times, way late, but sooner than most, for PR value. It's just smart business, and they reap kudos as well, from the growing demographics.

As for the opposite side of the coin \[consumers power of boycott of brands not sufficiently woke\] well, good luck, you know? The brand will outlast any protest. It just WILL. Reebok anyone? Hugo fucking Boss anyone? Coco Chanel? People forget, most don't care in the first place, some even go for contrary consumption to own the libs, or the cons for that matter.

Just be careful that DeFi comes with a plethora of added risks.

Hacks, scam, bugs, exploits, exit strategies happen all the time even with the most respected platforms. Also transactions are irreversible and there's no customer support. And as much as I like them, there's always the counterpart risk as basically any respectable defi has a company/org that backs it and has ownership of the smart contract. Best case scenario, the smart contract is your third party.

And for as much we all hate banks, keep in mind that DeFi (and many CeFi yeld platforms) don't provide the same level of asset security that banks provide. And even the best stablecoin is not backed by any government, while in the majority of the world's countries the respective government offer some kind of protections for fiat deposited in Bank accounts by their citizens.


That said, if you move considerable amount of tendies (so gas fees are no big issue), go DeFi on Ethereum. Aave, curve, compound, yearn finance to name a few (in order of trust -imho-).

If you hate fees look out defi on polygon (curve, aave, same as ethereum). Defi platforms on Solana are also super low fee and super fast and since they are new they have high APY right now (don't use it so can't give specific suggestions)

Most documentations are explained simply but may take multiple reads to fully comprehend how the systems work.

The Transmuter plays a major role in trying to maintaing the peg. The yield from the deposited Dai (earned via Yearn Finance Dai vault) is sent to the Transmuter contract. When you deposit alUSD into the Transmuter, you will be able to withdraw Dai at the 1:1 peg. The alUSD is burnt and Dai is distributed.

Things get more complicated though.

But due to some whales wanting to farm efficiently without incurring Slippage, there is a significant amount of Dai (permanently-ish) locked in the Transmuter which is earning yield for all users of Alchemix. Effectively boosting the interest earned on everyone deposits.

Another aspect is the arbritage opportunity. If alUSD loses its peg (alUSD worth less than Dai), you can swap alUSD via curve and deposit the cheap alUSD in the Transmuter to recieve the 1 alUSD:1 Dai. However by using the Transmuter, you are reducing the total amount of Dai in the system that is being used to yield farm. Which means you are reducing the effective yield of Alchemix Dai Vault for everyone. 


The ideas is simple but complicated systems have emerged from them.

yes, those that we, as a society, deem desirable - like investment into R&amp;D.

&gt;The tax laws are simply too complex 

lol, give it a rest.  I own 2 small businesses, have been involved in 5 startups, one pretty well known and producing a nutraceutical component (which means I also dealt with the FDA).  The tax laws are not simple but they are within the reach of the well motivated average person.  

&gt;The only reason we need tax breaks is because the tax rate is too high.

nope, see my post you responded to.

&gt;If we set a lower rate, citizens can pursue and finance those behaviors they want 

and strangely enough, countries with far higher tax rates are actually better environments to start a new business in .. Japan and German as examples -- see https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/entrepreneurship-rankings for the stat.  

Additionally, while we are the venture-capital capital of the world, start-ups and young small businesses play a smaller role in America's economy than in many other rich nations.

greenbean94,"There's one corporate firm that might fit into this category (putting particular value on top-tier finance or consulting experience) and it is literally the #1 ranked corporate firm, Wachtell.  Wachtell only actively recruits top (measured by 1L grades) students from seven law schools. It is very difficult to get a job there, and it's a bad idea to go to law school with the idea that you need to become a Wachtell associate.

With a few exceptions, hiring at the top corporate law firms is determined by two things: (1) whether the firms recruit at your law school (they all recruit at T14 schools, plus a few others, and some try to take most of their summer associate class from the top schools in the T14) and (2) your 1L grades. Previous work experience is not especially relevant, though it might be a conversation starter in an interview or something that helps on the margin. If it informs why you want to go into a particular area of corporate law (e.g. ""I was an investment banker prior to law school, and am now really interested in being a capital markets associate.""), it might  help in the interview, but it won't make up for your grades. I just graduated and know many people working at top 5-10 law firms in NYC - some went straight through to law school, some worked, but their pre-law school jobs didn't in any way affect their outcomes.

If you want to work at a top corporate law firm, the best way to do it is to go to a T14 law school and do well (at least in the top 1/3 of your class) on the curve your 1L year. Your grades are the most important factor in determining where you'll get a job. Many top firms have grade cutoffs (varying by school) below which they won't consider applicants at all. For now, you should focus on getting a good LSAT score.",2021-06-10 22:33:24

ResortBeautiful,"Hi! I am y4 business student (this coming aug), I am not sure if this is going to be super helpful, but pehaps maybe sharing my experiences may help? I know what youre feeling, that B+ no matter how hard you work dissapointment really hits hard. 

For me, what I realised that sometimes it comes down to luck and chance, sadly. Like for some of my mods, I did better for all the components and still ended up with a B+ while other mods where i felt i did the bare minimum i ended up with an A- or an A. Usually I attribute this is like the ridiculous papers that are supposed to separate the strong student from the weak student but just end up randomly rewarding some students. For example, when I took FIN3701, Corporate Finance, the finals was a 20+ question MCQ, in the exam, there were some questions that tested really werid obsequre memory facts like one single line burried in a whole mountain of slide decks, you could argue only smart students will memorise this one line from the entrie syllabus, but in truth, i only got it correct because it just so happen i was staring at that particular slide right before the test and did some jimmy neutron brain power memory to remember it. Additionally, in my year, the questions were randomised with no backwards navigation, which resulted in some people getting the really tough questions first and ended up having no time for the easy questions. For this exam particularly, it was clear to me that the forced bell curve really is kinda random at times and does not really favour those that put in effort. Another exam of this would be one of my BA modules, IT3010, Data Management With SQL, it was an MCQ exam only, and again I managed to guess some answers correctly and did better than my friends that are very clearly smarter than me. Personally, imo the bell curve really screws people over and throws them into the B+ grade even if you tried really really hard. 

The only 2 ways I have managed to get an A and A+ in any mod is firstly, like i mentioned dumb luck, and secondly you have to be an absolute god. When I did FIN3702 Investments (sth i cant remember the mod name) I absolutely devoted my entire life to it. I spent hours on it, staying up till 5am+ getting homework absolutely perfect, I would answer questions 2-3 times in class, get full marks for all the assignments and get 80% percentile for all exams. It was very very ridiculous. Not only that, I am naturally more inclined to stats and math so this mod really was right in my wheelhouse. Only then was i able to get an A :""). It was a pretty harrowing experience, while i am proud of it, I realised that it takes a lot to get an A in business school :/.

This experience might be limited to my own point of view, and i may be dumber than your average FCH biz kid so this might be a wharpped opinion, but it is an opinion nonetheless haha. Some people plan from the start of the sem which mod they want to dedicate their lives to, i did that with mine. I started before the sem began, studying seniors notes, looking through slides for class part opportunities and finding practice papers etc so perhaps you may try this. But this is not a guarantee, the bell curve gods might simply think you unworthy and cast you aside no matter how hard you try :"").

Sorry for the long post i am very passionate about the B+ A- grade boundary war. 

TLDR: If you wanna do well in biz school, dumb luck, or absolutely sacrifice your life and prepare to hit the ground running before the week 0 even begins.

ChanceTheWrapper68,"If you find these step complicated then I assume you haven't used defi a lot or not at all. If that assumption is correct I would like to warn you of the amount of risk you would be taking by doing what the OP is suggesting. 
Defi is not like Binance, you are on your own if something happens. In this case the largest risk that I would consider is that you have to purchase the Dfyn token because 50% of liquidity provider token has to be the Dfyn token and the other half is whatever you choose to match with it.
The token is very new and there is no guarantee that it will not be worthless in some time, if that happens you also lose whatever you matched with the Dfyn token. That said, I don't know this project and have only looked at their website. This might be a good project that goes far. But from what I saw there is nothing special about it.
Additionally, the OP is incentivised to advertise this since anyone who participates will have to buy the Dfyn token, therefore pushing up the price of the token (which the OP has already invested in). They present this as a good way to get high apy, but apy means nothing if the token is worthless. I find this disingenuous and therefore would trust the OP less (or they just don't realize this themselves or have some reason to believe in this project).

If you're interested in getting better yields than Binance offers, I would advise to either try out projects on the Binance chain first and only ones that have been around for a bit or time (pancakeswap, beefy finance, autofarm, pancakebunny, or some others that I don't know about) or if you want the cheaper fees of polygon then curve, aave, quickswap, and sushiswap are all reputable (but with lower apys) and they do not require you to purchase their tokens to participate.

If you knew all of this then sorry for wasting your time. I just get a bit scared for people because of the amount of scams and bad projects in this space and a new person often hasn't developed the level of scepticism and mistrust that you have to have.",2021-06-11 09:04:33

We will launch our TITAN liquidity pools on SushiSwap. The farms will be on our Iron Finance homepage

Emission rate at launch: 639,270 TITAN per day
TITAN/MATIC: 191,780 TITAN per day (30%)
IRON/USDC: 447,488 TITAN per day (70%)

My understanding is the Sushiswap liquidity pools are subsidised so 191780 Titan are allocated to the Titan/Matic pool per day, with $14 million in the pool at the moment it means this large amount of coins is spread amongst a small number of deposited coins, hence the high interest?

herbys,"&gt; What does a Cybertruck do that a lightly used F-150 XL couldn't?

Driving at six cents per mile of operational cost. An F150 costs three times as much in operational cost per mile.

That such difference in operational cost can offset the additional acquisition cost of an electric truck at a certain mileage level should be fairly easy to understand for someone with a background in finance. Cost difference which for the single motor truck is less than $10K compared to a minimally equipped F150, and that is not even counting tax incentives and resale price of the truck after you are done with it.
And if you are comparing with a used truck, you have to consider the even lower efficiency and higher maintenance cost of a used truck, and resale difference of the used electric truck and the numbers will still make sense after a certain mileage level. What that mileage level is depends on the cost of the used truck, it's fuel economy, how long you plan to keep it and the actual resale price of a Cybertruck, which we don't know yet, but if you are saying that a no mileage that intersection happens I will have to call BS on your stated credentials since it's finance 101 that a curve with a higher fixed cost with a lower incremental cost will eventually intercept one with a lower fixed cost and higher incremental cost. Do the math for yourself if you want to find out when, I did it and there were very reasonable scenarios where the numbers added up.

BNEIte,"Behind the paywall:


Beijing will cast the G7 as a democratic China-bashing weekend, but it has only itself to blame. Australia’s presence shows it is getting support from a growing list of nations.


There is a view liberal democracy is in its twilight years and this weekend’s gathering of the Group of Seven industrialised economies – with Australia, South Korea, and India also invited – could be little more than a heroic last stand by the so-called Democratic 10, or D10.


According to this perspective, Scott Morrison landing in Britain to rally democracies to resist coercion and preserve freedom is a fool’s errand and will needlessly provoke China. Why will he not accept the tide of history has changed and is washing away liberal practices in its wake?


The record shows arguments about inevitability are almost always wrong. That China is powerful is undeniable.


Even so, it is poorly appreciated that China, and the entire region more generally, cannot continue to rise without the resources, know-how and assistance of the democracies about to meet in Cornwall.


We know getting democracies to act together is more difficult than herding cats. But they are far from a spent force and democracies retain considerable strategic and economic agency. The summit will be one of the more consequential gatherings for Australia and the Indo-Pacific region.


A rule of thumb in international affairs is the inverse relationship between the size of the grouping and the determination to tackle important and difficult issues.


Unlike recent G7 summits with a motley collection of observer nations, this year’s version has only four invited guests – the three regional democracies mentioned and democratic South Africa. Narendra Modi is unable to attend in person because of the Covid-19 emergency in India.



But composition is indicative of intent. It is no coincidence that Australia and India were invited. With the US and Japan, they comprise the Indo-Pacific Quad, the four formidable economic and military powers most committed to counter directly the worst aspects of Chinese behaviour.


The Quad countries may be ahead of the curve but there is broader support for them than is widely appreciated.


Britain, the EU and Canada belatedly have come to a similar conclusion that the military, industrial, trade, technological and repressive policies of China is a serious and growing threat to their individual and collective interests.


It is worth noting this year’s G7 summit is framing discussion on many issues ranging from pandemic response to trade and technological policy as defined by a contest between liberal and authoritarian approaches.


Resolve is one thing. What about the notion that the proverbial horse has bolted and it is futile to resist creeping Chinese economic and eventually political and military dominance of the region? The combined military weight and prowess of the democracies are superior, even if the gap is closing quickly. But much will depend on the trajectory and decisions of the trading nations in the Indo-Pacific.


In this context, Chinese hopes of economic dominance may be fulfilled only if maritime East Asia becomes a Sino-centric region. Many believe this has already occurred or else is imminent.


It may surprise some that foreign direct investment from Japan, the US, EU and South Korea – all present at Cornwall this weekend – are more important sources of capital for developing trading nations in Asia than is China. Partnerships with government and firms from these advanced democracies add far more to the productive capacity of these developing maritime nations than do interactions with Chinese entities.


Moreover, these regional economies – China included – are heavily reliant on importing innovation, technology and know-how, the lion’s share coming from entities headquartered in D10 nations. Beijing cannot afford economic separation from democratic nations but seeks their subservience and acquiescence to unequal arrangements in China’s favour.


In large measure, ambitious Chinese blueprints such as the Belt and Road Initiative and Made in China 2025 were formulated to address its own vulnerabilities and shortcomings. Even then, the BRI cannot succeed if China is unable to freely access the deep consumer markets in Western Europe.


This then is the frustration and danger for the Chinese Communist Party. China needs continued access to D10 consumer markets, technologies, innovation, know-how and finance to get itself into a position of enduring strength.


Far from being a self-sustaining economic behemoth, China is making the mistake of spiting the nations on which it needs to continue its rise. The list of complaints is long and growing – systemic economic predation and theft, unreciprocated trade and investment practices, military assertiveness, territorial expansion, economic coercion and interference in the institutions of other nations.


Shouldn’t China have expected pushback? Yes, although Beijing was relying on a divide-and-rule approach, which is possible in the absence of democratic unity or where there is a loss of faith in democratic community itself. Encouraging the latter is what its messaging about superior authoritarian competence is all about – a perspective too many enjoying the fruits of democratic society are all too happy to accept without further investigation.


Hubris and overreach will come back to bite. China has crossed the line too far and too many times. Democracies in North America, Europe and Asia are starting to talk in similar ways and move in similar directions, albeit at different speeds as democratic processes are always messy and inelegant.


Australia has been invited to the past three summits, including the one this weekend, and it is playing more than its part in focusing and steering the conversation, with the economic bruises to show for it.


But we are receiving support from a growing list of nations and the Prime Minister’s attendance is confirmation of this.


Beijing will cast the summit as a democratic China-bashing weekend, but it has only itself to blame.",2021-06-11 17:52:25
Kiwi_Global,"think people are excited about defi because it brought new opportunities in this space and there is a glimp of hope that crypto assets aren't just going to be converted to dollars in the end, only for speculation to increase your net value outside crypto. with defi there are ways you can leave your assets on the network while also profiting, against just holding the asset to sell it.

i'm eth bull so keep that in mind, my experience is mostly in eth and ofc would recommend to check defi on ethereum BUT with calculated risks. you asked me are there better deals on exchanges or on ethereum and the thing is, nobody can tell you what is more profitable in the end. its similar as if you asked me what next token will moon. no one knows, and if they claim to know they are probably lying.

in my view if you are entering with smaller amounts exchanges like coinbase or binance are just fine. but keep in mind that on binance chain there were a lot of hacks for smaller cap tokens lately so don't ape into staking the most obscure tokens, stick with those that have already some history behind them.

for ethereum you can check ROI percentages using [https://zapper.fi](https://zapper.fi) \- go to Farm and under Farmin Opportunities search for token you have, and there you can check current ROI on different dapps. Zapper is just a view from which you can interact with all different dapps from one interface. So you got aave, curve, uniswap etc in there, no need to go to different web pages. also keep in mind that ROI or APY are constantly changing and there is always a smart contract risk. But for the most popular dapps the risk isn't that high because they were already battle tested. also the disadvantage are the fees for interacting with the network. on ethereum fees are currently larger than on binance chain for example. for them to fall down you will have to wait unfortunately a few weeks till arbitrum gets live. currently you can transfer your funds on polygon using zapper for smaller fees between contracts. but polygon is a side chain so with it you aren't as bad as on binance chain(centralized) but not also high security(ethereum), you are somewhere in the middle..

&amp;#x200B;

from my experience, if you want to earn something from defi on ethereum right now, firstly read about different defi apps and what they do. after you select one enter slowly but you need to have at least couple of hundred dollars to be profitable in the medium term(3-6months) because you are dealing with network fees which will eat you net value if you are just clicking around on different dapps.

&amp;#x200B;

hopefully you can find something that will suit you. if defi is boring(in the end when was finance really exciting?) you can check other dapps that aren't defi, like pooltogether for lossless lottery, maybe ens or even opensea for ntfs. but keep in mind those aren't financial opportunities, they are more exploring type of apps",2021-06-11 19:12:06
Basement_Armory,"@OP, I get what you're saying, as you've told people at least twice now that you're saying ""What if all you had to use for armor was AR500 targets?"" .....So that we're on the same page, I'll give you the short answer, a possibility of what you're looking for, and the correct response.

Short answer: ""...then I wouldn't run armor."" 

Lots of people don't run armor, and while yes I do have some and I do run it, it is not a necessity. The honest to goodness truth is, most of us will never, EVER be in a gunfight. We train in the hopes that if we HAVE to be, we'll be able to swiftly and accurately employ whatever means we have to end it quick. As such, if we're ever in a position that we should be going in with armor, it means this situation is already royally fucked - unless it is literally your job to do this and if that is the case, you're gonna have good armor already (I hope). Truthfully, armor weighs you down unless you're spending $texas$ for something lightweight enough that it doesn't ruin your day to be in it for more than 5 minutes. So if you don't NEED it, go without it. Think of Heemayer's ""Killdozer"" - AR500 plate is 3/8"" thick, and he stacked 1/2""+ inch thick armor all over it .... but unless you as a person have the horsepower and endurance of a Komatsu d355a (and even then, it was only running at like 10MPH), carrying several loaded mags and any other kit PLUS heavy, heat-inducing plates is not gonna be a good time.

If you really want, I am happy do give a graduate-level dissertation as to WHY using steel made for construction buckets is a terrible idea for armor, but for the sake of an already long response, I'll just say ""don't"". If you are dead set on using it, I would slip a phone book or textbook over the front and have some sort closed cell foam pad on the back to absorb trauma. Part of the point of armor is not only to deflect bullets, but to slow them down and spread/absorb the impact enough that it doesn't feel like you got hit by a 3200fps Mack truck. The thickness and repetitive layers of the phonebook/textbook can help slow it down and capture it in place enough that the spalling could be minimized as well as slowing the bullet even more to prevent penetration, and the foam backing may also work as a cheap way to not feel slapped by the side of a bulldozer.

IF. YOU. HAVE. TO. RUN. BUDGET. PLATES. .... which NOBODY does, but if for whatever reason you absolutely HAVE to keep up with your larper8or hipstergram friends, don't spend nearly $400 on a ""if the gunshots don't kill me, the plates will"" setup when you can get a legitimate setup for the same price. You can pick up a Condor MOPC plate carrier for around $75 new if you look around or a DDT Krieger for near the same. After that, search for ""4401"" or ""4401sh"" plates. Bulletproof-it.com and bodyarmoronline.com both sell a pair of the 4401 single curve composite stand-alone plates that are essentially Hesco 4401's without the logo for around $300. You can even finance with something like Sezzle, or for the super-broke with garbage credit, you can use Quadpay or the PayPal Buy-in-4 options to split that $300 into much easier to chew on bites. There are also RMA 1155 plates, and many other affordable options that are infinitely less likely to sever arteries from their spall than splashy steel. You can do it, I believe in you.",2021-06-11 21:34:35

TheGarbageStore,"Stablecoin update: the total supply of stablecoins is $108.953 billion, a 0.38% increase week-over week.    A 0.38% increase is not really what you would expect to see if money was massively flowing in to stablecoin issuers.   We saw some growth in the US-domiciled and non-US-domiciled custodial sectors (Tether).   We have a new high of $22.32b USDC, $9.356b BUSD (despite Silvergate having some issues with Binance), $1.009b PAX, $0.714b HUSD, $1.436b TUSD, and $0.178b GUSD- the latter two being new highs.   In the algorithmic sector, Dai increased 9.6% week-over-week, while many of the others decreased: we have $0.203b sUSD, $1.899b UST, $0.366b USDN, and $0.713b LUSD, along with $2.043b Fei.  The supply of Tether increased 0.94% to $62.6b.  
 
Here on BTCM, we proudly bring you Real Quantitative Alpha with respect to the stablecoin sector.    Often it is asked “How risky is Tether”?    Often, it is answered very poorly in a conspiratorial manner.  Let’s take a look at stablecoin borrowing rates on Compound: Tether was added to this protocol in mid-May and you can borrow it (or other stablecoins)  in exchange for paying an APR, shown below on the y-axis with time on the X-axis.  

https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/cryptocurrency-lending/compound-borrow-rates

If you integrate the area under the curve for these rates, you get a rough estimate of the interest the borrower pays, which allows us to ask the question “if we want to borrow a stablecoin, is Tether more expensive to borrow than USDC”?   Now, the real, hard-hitting question is “what is each stablecoin’s perceived default risk”, and the market is an aggregate of all of our feelings on the matter.   But, Compound supply rates don’t tell you that entirely because there’s variable supply/demand for each product due to things like USDT-denominated perps markets and USDC-denominated smart contracts. 

So, let’s integrate this function, from May 2020 to the present time, with respect to time.    The ratio of the USDT area under the curve (AUC)  to the USDC AUC is 1.3157:  Tether is more expensive to borrow since its inception.    If you only calculate the rates after the date of the NYAG settlement (23 Feb 2021), the USDT-USDC premium drops to 1.137, with the caveat of this being a smaller interval.    The market reacted and Tether became cheaper to borrow.   If a default happens, the borrower is favored, because furnishing a USDT-denominated debt becomes cheaper in USD.     Finally, if you only calculate the rates post-release of Tether’s balance sheet, the premium steepens again to 1.224- which is still lower than when Tether was under investigation by NYAG. This is very recent and I have the least confidence in this number.

How do you interpret this data?  The relative borrowing costs of USDT to USDC have dropped since the settlement, which implies that the market thinks risk is lower.   Now, you can buy BTC with borrowed USDT or borrowed USDC.    The USDT markets are more liquid and developed.  The 13.7% Tether premium is an aggregate of a liquidity premium and a risk premium, which implies that Compound users (who tend to be high-information digital asset veterans, given the protocol is not incredibly user friendly) perceive the additional riskiness of Tether as being quite low.",2021-06-12 01:00:01

Through my experiences, it's all about overcoming the learning curve.

&amp;#x200B;

Reading, listening &amp; watching always helps, but when you are actively establishing a startup, you need to be actively always doing what you have read, listened to &amp; watched - to then after evaluating the bad/good which came after doing it.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, if things are not going the way you planned, modify your plan into something more coherent in nature to achieve the goal you have established.

&amp;#x200B;

In business, it's one thing to know it, and a whole other thing to know why/how/where + when to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

Another challenge for me, in the beginning, was understanding that everything you have learned related to your industry &amp; service are things that your customers vaguely understand. So you are, in a way, trying to get the attention of something super opposite to you personally.

&amp;#x200B;

Why? Because that's why you are there to service them - if they already knew everything about it, they'd tell you to fly a kite &amp; they already have that taken care of.

&amp;#x200B;

**Simple Example:**

Let's say you hate finance - who would you consider paying for help?

A person the opposite of you that loves finance so much they do it every day.",2021-06-12 02:09:52
Rain_Bear,"From the link:

The Laffer curve as presented is simplistic in that it assumes a single tax rate and a single labor supply. Actual systems of public finance are more complex, and there is serious doubt about the relevance of considering a single marginal tax rate.\[4\] In addition, revenue may well be a multivalued function of tax rate; for instance, an increase in tax rate to a certain percentage may not result in the same revenue as a decrease in tax rate to the same percentage (a kind of hysteresis). Furthermore, the Laffer curve does not take explicitly into account the nature of the tax avoidance taking place. It is possible that if all producers are endowed with two survival factors in the market (ability to produce efficiently and ability to avoid tax), then the revenues raised under tax avoidance can be greater than without avoidance, and thus the Laffer curve maximum is found to be farther right than thought. The reason for this result is that if producers with low productive abilities (high production costs) tend to have strong avoidance abilities as well, a uniform tax on producers actually becomes a tax that discriminates on the ability to pay. However, if avoidance abilities and productive abilities are unrelated, then this result disappears.\[66\]

Additionally, the Laffer curve depends on the assumption that tax revenue is used to provide a public good that is separable in utility and separate from labor supply, which may not be true in practice.\[65\]

Some A/R function are co-mingled with credit functions (like where I use to previously work) and you might assist with credit analysis, updating credit records, etc. 

If the company you are joining is advanced on the automation curve, you might be assisting with A/R master data activities (opening customer accounts in the ERP, closing accounts, changing invoicing terms, etc.)

If your company has A/R co-mingled with accounting, you might be performing A/R reconciliations for large customers who make lump-sum payments to their accounts periodically and invoices have to be manually matched/paired to keep on top of the account. 

A/R and A/P functions get really bad rep on a lot of these subreddit because they are not sexy but, depending on the organization and the structure, this is not a bad place to start you career. 

Folks in finance forget that A/R and A/P is where a business 'core' exists from a back-office perspective (collecting from customers paying your suppliers) so you can get a really deep understanding of the business and its cash activities if you are switched on! 

E.g. who are their top customers? how often do they pay? How good is the business at collecting cash? How easily does the business extend credit? Is the business trying to attract customers with super relaxed credit? 

In my old organization, if  you worked in A/R you had A LOT of interaction with sales including the VP because of allowance for doubtful accounts reporting, collection cycles problems, new customers with unusual credit terms or one-off transactions or 'deals'.

Beefy and Autofarm don't work on the Ethereum network like Yearn does.  They work on other networks such as BSC and Polygon.  The fees are cheaper on BSC and Poly so it's easier to jump in and out of vaults and you don't have to worry about tx fees cutting into your gains any time the APY drops to 8% and you want to change vaults.

moanonyme,"Je préface en précisant que si je bosse en finance, je ne suis pas du tout économiste, et la macro c'est toujours complexe, donc tout ce que je dis est a prendre avec des pincettes.

Ce que tu décris est vrai : l'effet du 
 lag entre l'inflation réelle et les prix d'abord des produits et services, puis des salaires. Mais en réalité a moins qu'il y est hyper inflation son impact n'est pas si important si tant est que les salaires suivent.

Par contre l'effet sur les prêts est bien réel, et c'est très positif pour les emprunteurs. Ça devient un vrai levier d'accession au capital.

Une théorie de macro qui n'est plus 100% vraie dit aussi que l'inflation c'est la variable d'ajustement utilisée par les banques centrales pour pouvoir accélérer ou ralentir l'économie et arriver à un niveau d'équilibre ou théoriquement on a le chômage minimum. C'est la Philips curve. L'idée c'est de dire que comme il y a peut d'inflation tu peux te permettre d'économiser pour consommer plus tard, la où un peu plus d'inflation forcerait les gens a consommer immédiatement, ce qui augmenterait consommation, et donc production et activité. 

Une autre idée pour répondre un peu a l'envers sur pourquoi j'aimerais voir plus d'inflation : les banques centrales font du quantitative easing de façon assez aggressive depuis 2008 pour relancer l'economie. Mais depuis qu'elles font ça deux choses se sont passé : le PIB se decorelle de plus en plus du salaire moyen ou du chômage, et nous n'avons pas d'inflation si on regarde les mesures tradi comme le CPI.

En réalité il y a de l'inflation... Mais sur les capitaux, deux actifs ont vu leur prix s'envoler depuis 2008 par rapport aux produits et services : c'est l'immobilier et les valeurs boursières. Tout le monde dit que les prix sont complètement decorrelés des fondamentaux. Pourquoi ?  Parceque tout l'argent du quantitative easing est capté par les propriétaires de capital, qui le réinvestissent dans ces actifs. Le retour de l'inflation montrerait pour moi que l'argent circule à nouveau dans les classes de travailleurs et consommateurs.",2021-06-13 17:27:12

FuzzyOneAdmin,"OMG, mate, with a Masters in Accounting all you need to do is supplement it with a CIPS certificate and you are good to go. So, to make things simple. Supply chain has many branches that include logistics, inventory management, purchasing, information management, finance...analytics. It like Medicine, you have a lot of specialities sitting under the title. You need to decide which specialty attracts you and then do a course on that speciality. Now, with a masters degree you don't need to start at the bottom, you can come in at the middle level. Consider this, would being a warehouse worker or a buyer in a company help your career? Nope, because they are now under your professional proficiency level. What you need to do is leverage your CPA to get a good logistics job, which you will find very easily if you apply for middle management level roles where your CPA is a benefit. 

Just remember, supply chain intro roles can be a fork lift driver or a warehouse stacker, or it can be a procurement manager a supply chain analyst and more. Just decide what branch you want to take and start your career in the middle of an organizational hierarchy. Don't waste time being a pawn when you can be a rook. 

I speak from experience, having started out literally sweeping floors back in the 1970's and working up the ladder to C-level roles. The degree is great for basic knowledge and getting a good level job, but what will make you great is your attitude, your learning curve and your ingenuity.

Oh, and never ever say, ever ""I don’t plan on furthering my education"" this is the dumbest thing to say.

ObModder,"""The Gotthard Post is one of the best-loved Swiss paintings, embodying as it does the quintessence of the Alpine country. The stagecoach, now the very model of romantic serenity, had at the time only been travelling the pass for a few decades. The new road was celebrated as a masterpiece of engineering. Koller here depicts the acceleration it made possible by having the vehicle overtake a herd of cows as it plunges down the valley. The varieties of movement shown – the plodding cows and the racing coach – amplify the painting’s dramatic effect. The panicked calf serves Koller as an anecdotal focus for his illustration of speed. The coach is heading straight for the viewer along the steep zigzag of the pass, and, under full steam and heavily laden as it is, threatens to overshoot the curve, as apparently exemplified by the direction in which the driver is holding his whip.
And yet Koller is far from painting a realistic portrait of the Gotthard post. One of his initial ideas, showing guests at a rest stop, would have been a more faithful representation of what was a safe and dependable means of transport, moving over 70,000 travellers a year across the 2,100-metre pass. 
Koller’s Gotthard Post was commissioned by Switzerland’s Northeastern Railway as a farewell gift to Alfred Escher, the Swiss tycoon who was leaving to help found and finance the Gotthard railway. Koller deliberately avoided including any direct reference to the modernizing influence of rail, preferring instead to create an allegory of the acceleration of means of transport.
The painter was not particularly fond of the work himself; according to him, the best thing about it was its title. But it was to enjoy great and long-standing popularity, due surely to the associative range of its motif: the Gotthard is a symbol of safe passage across the Alps, of a remarkable feat of Swiss engineering, for all that the accomplishment itself is not the main subject. And finally, the Gotthard is emblematic of the sublimity of the Alps. All of these aspects stand for the qualities and achievements of the young nation of Switzerland, and thus crystallize the concept of ‘home’.""

SnoopHappyCoin,"I agree with a lot of your points except when you say that TITAN has no value. It has value in the sense that you can use it in a liquidity pool to get a high APR and it's also linked to Iron Finance. If you believe in their mission it might hold value to you.  
It is similar to tokens like AAVE, QUICK, CAKE, BAKE, SUSHI,...  
But of course as I said in my post, native exchange tokens are really risky, especially when they are new and not used by a lot of people. TVL is at 1.8 billion so user base is getting a lot bigger. At the moment TITAN is still doing great. Had a few drops but keeps going up.   


As you said, the risk is still high. One of the advantages though is that the TITAN yield returns are continuously being sold. Both in autocompounding vaults and manually. Even for small amounts because the transaction cost is so low on polygon.  
It becomes more dangerous when lots of people start holding TITAN and then a whale decides to dump all of it causing FUD and a price drop.  


But I get why you left, there are definitely safer options (like AAVE and CURVE) out there but for the risk takers (and lets admit it, greedy people) among us, Iron Finance  is still a great way to get huge APR's  


However, Iron Finance still seems to have a lot of potential. There are 18k IRON holders and 13K TITAN holders right now. I feel like that is not the ceiling. But feelings can be wrong. TITAN could drop to 1$ today and you would be happy you got out, but it's also possible it grows for another couple of weeks to 100$ and then you might be sorry. Time will tell :-)",2021-06-14 17:35:49
Ehoro,"Don't be disingenuous. 

Many people do not understand tax. The article you're referring to doesn't specify that we should tax unrealized gains, it used the 'true tax rate' to get a point across about unequal sources of revenue. If you read the whole article you'd know that the bigger issue is utilizing assets at their market rate for collateral while not recognizing their value creating a taxable event + when being able to reset the cost basis to market rate upon death without having to ever  trigger the taxable event. And when you talk about those points it's more politics and finance, as the laffer curve never entered the discussion, and it is highly debated where the maximum efficient tax rate is anyway.


It is good to link FRED data, good stuff there. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881600Q
Employed full time: Median usual weekly real earnings: Wage and salary workers: 16 years and over

And your source 

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEPAINUSA672N
Real Median Personal Income in the United States

So the first one is relatively stagnant until Q2 2020, the second shows a net gain of 50% up until 2018.

Both can be true, and it's about how you look at data, there's a lot more information to be gathered here.

Do the FRED numbers include benefits tied to jobs, like vacation? Is it possible real median household wages are actually worse on a per hour worked basis, because (using random  numbers) 30 years ago there were 1.3 wage earners per household, now there are 1.6. It also does not include part time work, which may be worse off than full time employment in general?

From the personal income data, likewise does it account for the average amount of hours worked for these weekly wages? Maybe there's a story here, where business owners and self employed have been seeing gains but wage earners less so? ( the former dataset does not include self employed and business owners) Does CPI capture all the true costs tied to modern living, like being able to budget for your own retirement since there will likely be no pension for many of us?

I'm not trying to argue all the finer points, and fred data is great, but there's still a lot to read into it as well.",2021-06-14 19:18:26
xaretha,"Glad to help! BA mods are very time consuming, much more than the usual biz mods. For the DBA3k mods I took, there were individual programming assignments to be completed each week for about 1/2 - 3/4 of the sem. This is on top of the 2 CAs and group projects (can be multiple assignments) to be done

I did the usual fin cos it was easy to map on exchange and I did not like mno/mkt (also didn't do well, scoring B, B-). While the 3k fin mods did not appeal to me (not very fond of all those markowitz, alpha beta stuff), I was interested in the 4k fintech mods (at that time I thought it was the closest alternative to BA mods). But tbh now I think that supply chain would be nice to spec in as an alternative to BA, although unfortunately I left DAO2703 to be cleared on exchange cos nth else to clear as a BAC student. However, I'm not so clear about the supply chain spec since I don't have any friends doing that and didn't take any related mods.

worldwide369,"Many great points so far, so I'll mention curve ball ideas that haven't been covered.

If water levels do continue to rise, you could maybe purchase land and build a house on it that is elevated, kind of like the old fashioned houses for when it floods.

Have a big ass plastic boat in storage for if it ever floods. Then you will fit right in with the floating markets  :-) 

Water wont be around forever during a flood, it's in many rich land owners and government property interests to keep the lands dry. They will surely want the BTS and Airport to stay dry.

As china continues to dam rivers up, maybe it will reduce chao praya river level flow? Speaking of China, if a dam was ever built from Hua Hin to Pattaya, it would probably be the chinese who finance the whole thing.

If you do purchase, and the payments are low, and then the property is worthless in 25 years, then you could have a bit of peace of mind by pretending that the monthly payments were just ""rent"" that you would have paid if you rented to begin with.

Humans are pretty clever, and have lived on water (venice) and near flood areas for thousands of years. The change is gradual, you will have time to prepare if you keep an eye on it. the riskier it gets, prices will reflect that, so maybe you can sell in 10-15 years?",2021-06-15 11:55:57

When you earn on Beefy you auto compound meaning you get more LP tokens you don't get the reward token. This can be good or bad..on stablecoin pools you get more stable coins that you redeem when you unstake - but if you want the titan token you have to stake on [iron.finance](https://iron.finance) and claim the rewards there manually (or whatever that auto vault thing is I'm not familiar with it).

After thinking about things today I pulled Iron/USDC out of Beefy and added more to stake directly on iron finance.  As I earn Titan I'm going to put more into the titan/matic pool on beefy to build up the riskier high yield position without having to risk my own capital.  The TVL on titan is continuing to rise and the iron token hasn't shown any indication of losing it's peg.

I'm shooting for \~85% in stable pools and 15% in the beefy pool for titan/matic.  Once I get my position I'll start selling for profit.

Not only does the proposal consider whether the IP should be enforced more broadly, but it considers a specific example of Saddle Finance, which the proposer claims has been accused of copying Curve's code. The platform is managed by a core team but it has a decentralized autonomous organization that is able to propose and vote for ways it should be changed, using Curve's governance token CRV. The key questions are whether Curve can enforce its IP - since the organization itself is largely decentralized - and also whether it should, something that would be new to the largely open-source and unregulated DeFi industry.

proverbialbunny,"&gt;So does that mean Wall Street itself is a lie?

It depends what you're considering a lie.  Most of wall street is banks.. you know, loans, savings, and checking accounts.

The trading side of wall street has historically relied on 1) quantitative finance, eg arbitrage bots 2) hedge funds, aiming to reduce volatility not increase profits 3) and legal insider information.  Part of the job for many traders is going to bars and hearing the talk of the town.  Lucrative information leaks.  Eg, Citadel two days before AMC's announcement that blew up their stock, they bought a bunch of calls.  They made away like bandits.  Inside information runs rampant this part of wall street.

&gt;Cramer is just a confident idiot trying to see patterns in static.

If you study his recommendations he is a trend follower.  He says buy what has already gone up in the morning and says sell what has already gone down.  Outside of that he has a nearly 50/50 chance of being correct.

&gt;Cathie Wood and Bill Ackman are charismatic charlatans trying to fool investors into thinking they know what they're doing. 

Some people get it rich by making speculative bets that pay off.  This is part of the probability curve.  If you make speculative bets you'll win bigger than an index fund or lose bigger than an index fund.  The problem is when they win it big they do not step down.  The more trades one makes the more they are diversifying over time, so over time people like Cathie Woods will always end up at the top of the bell curve being no better than investing in an index fund.

&gt;Robinhood is a crime against humanity.

I'm pretty sure everyone knows that at this point.  The lying CEO who makes money off of hedge funds using trading data to predict the future using bots.

&gt;It's on par with the advent of heroin in terms of its devastating impact on human well-being. The addictive gamification of trading that Robinhood has brought us will be the downfall of millions. 

Uhh.. a bit harsh.  Like I mentioned earlier, speculative bets have a wide bell curve (lognorm curve technically) so if someone is young and has nothing to lose, why not make a few speculative bets?  If they lose everything they lose very little, if they win a lot they make a killing.  The downside is some of these kids don't know to stop.  You make a few trades.  If you win, you win.  Walk away.  Now you have something to lose.  Now is the time to move into VTI or whatever.  I wouldn't blame Robinhood on that.  Their trading style is legitimate and there are studies to back it up, as long as they walk away when the time is right.

wildheart38,"I changed. All along in Public Service. 

Was in Organization A for 1.5 years. 

In charge of the enforcement and contract management portfolio in the most dreary and insipid department ever (no, its not even HR or Finance). Not related to my field of studies and I remember sighing every morning, even on Fridays.  It was a retirement home basically - got pros and cons. You can actually knock off largely on time. Cruise along, but frustrated and not happy. Loads of office politics among the young staff and old staff. Bosses are clueless and loads of arrow (crafting knee-jerk SOPs, etc) towards young staff. Limited professional growth and only a rare chance to rotate out of the department to do the core work of the stat board, or even work that is of critical national importance.

Then Organization B came along with an offer at the start of 2020. Was thrilled because I had interned there as a Research intern (but in another department) before, and my position was also a Research Executive. So I naively thought it would be the same. 

To my horror, the work was completely research and work on legislation. Every job has its learning curve but if you are not trained in legal stuff, its a learning wall. It was not mentioned in the job description or interview that they were looking out for a candidate with legal background. Funnily during my exit interview, HR told me grimly that my position is a hot seat (meaning people quit every couple of months) and after I left, they updated the job description to specify that candidates with legal training can apply. I remember feeling very lost at work and my RO got impatient and personal with me. 

Organization C extended an offer 6 months after I joined Organization B , and because I thought I already had no future in Organization B, I joined despite my intuition having some reservations. 

I think I posted about my time in Organization C. I dont want to revisit those memories. Basically I went to Hell and back, and was on a verge of a mental breakdown. I lasted 2.5 months before resigning (including notice period). 

2020 was a horrible year for me. 

Now in Organization D and I am finally contented with my work. Its a 1 year non-renewable contract though (left with 4 months), and Im currently looking to reapply back to Organization D as a full time perm/contract with possibility of being emplaced as perm staff or something. 

On hindsight, shouldnt have left Organization A. Wasn’t happy but I think my time in Organizations B and C were worse. But hindsight is always 20/20 lah.",2021-06-18 14:01:32

Riusech,"¿ Qué son las Defi y por qué deberías saberlo ?  
Muy Posiblemente habrás oído hablar o habrás leído algún titular en prensa sobre las Defi y te habrás preguntado ¿qué son? . En este vídeo trataremos de explicarte en qué consisten.    
No dejes de visitar nuestra web pigmaliontrading.com y suscribirte a este canal para conocer más sobre el mundo cripto y otras oportunidades de inversión.  
‘DeFi’  Decentralized Finance significa Finanzas Descentralizadas en español.  
Las Defi han creado un ecosistema financiero descentralizado y global totalmente inclusivo (pues cualquier persona con un smartphone sin necesidad de cuenta bancaria puede acceder) justo y transparente, resistente a la fuerza, la censura y totalmente automatizado, sin la necesidad de intermediarios estériles que encarezcan, ralenticen o impidan las operaciones entre la comunidad , como sí ocurre en el sistema financiero tradicional, fuertemente centralizado.  
Las finanzas descentralizadas, aspiran a eliminar los bancos tradicionales y otros intermediarios de las operaciones financieras ya que son opacos, centralizados y difícilmente añaden ya nuevo valor. Las Defi hacen que el papel actual de los Bancos, los prestamistas o las Agencias de Seguros se desvanezca lentamente pues emulan en muchos casos las operaciones del sistema financiero tradicional, como los préstamos, pago o ganancia de intereses o el intercambio de divisas o moneda de forma descentralizada y atomatizada gracias a los contratos inteligentes que eliminan la necesidad de intermediarios.  
Estos contratos inteligentes se crearon en un principio sobre la red de Ethereum, de la que Vitalik Butherin Es el cocreador e inventor y descrita como la “combinación de una red descentralizada de minería digital y una plataforma de desarrollo de software”   
Ether, el nombre de su criptomoneda que es más conocida por el nombre de su red Ethereum seguro que la conocéis pues es la segunda criptomoneda más popular después de Bitcoin.  
Esta red actualmente aloja plataformas como Uniswap, SushiSwap y Curve Finance que es un protocolo de liquidez de intercambio descentralizado diseñado para el comercio extremadamente eficiente de stablecoins (criptomonedas estables normalmente al valor de 1 dólar estadounidense) y Bitcoin sintético para la red Ethereum donde se pueden obtener intereses por la participación en éstos además del intercambio totalmente privado de monedas y otros servicios financieros.  
Como veréis existen numerosas ventajas en las Defi con respecto a las finanzas tradicionalmente centralizadas, especialmente cuando los intereses obtenidos son sobre una stablecoin, una criptomoneda de valor estable lo que elimina el riesgo de pérdida de valor por la volatilidad de éstas, aunque obviamente existen otros riesgos que enumeraremos al final del vídeo.  
Si bien las Defi comenzaron a desarrollarse con fuerza en 2018 especialmente sobre Ethereum ha sido durante el último año 2020 y este 2021 cuando han vivido un verdadero Boom con un movimiento diario de miles de millones de dólares.  
Sin embargo diversos problemas relativos a la escalabilidad de Ethereum están actualmente afectando a los principales proyectos DeFi en esta red. Los altos costos de comisión y la  congestión son un problema real que ha provocado que otras redes Blockchain empiecen a ganar mayor visibilidad.   
Estas redes Blockchain descentralizadas con enorme potencial para el desarrollo de DeFi son Cardano, Polkadot, Avalanche, RSK o Celo.  
Sin embargo ha sido la Binance Smart Chain aunque se trate de una Red centralizada que pertenece al Exchange Chino Binance la que ha tenido un enorme éxito en materia de soporte para DeFi por la escalabilidad de su red y los bajos costos por operaciones de intercambio, aunque esta funcione de forma mucho más centralizada que las otras que ya os he citado, Binance lleva claramente la ventaja respecto a las demás y es actualmente rival directa de la red de Ethereum.  
Riesgos y desventajas de las Defi  
Las Aplicaciones Defi se ejecutan en Blockchains descentralizadas como Ethereum Aunque esto no implica que todos protocolos de las Defi sean totalmente descentralizados, ni siquiera todas las redes sobre las que operan como vimos en el caso de la Binance Smart Chain.  
El Espacio Defi está aún verde y en constante evolución Uniswap, dForce, Bancor, Balancer has sufrido hacks por vulnerabilidad en sus Smart Contracts.  
Este estado inicial de desarrollo del entorno Defi implica también que la dificultad para el aprovechamiento de todas las posibilidades y servicios que nos ofrecen  es notable aún. Las Defi no son aún para todo el mundo, queda mucho camino por recorrer en el desarrollo de entornos más intuitivos y ‘user friendly’ que faciliten el acceso al usuario medio, algo aún lejos de ser una realidad.  
Otro riesgo ha sido las numerosas estafas que se han dado como es el caso de TurtleDex en la red de Binance, pues aprovechan la codicia de algunos usuarios aún poco informados que corren a lograr los retornos prometidos para su capital.  
Aún así la seguridad en Blockchain una vez se vayan superando los escollos propios del estado de temprano desarrollo de las defi es altísimo.

Filipe_G21,"A Buyback providers more flexibility, but this does not exclude completely the possibility for a burn. 

For instance, we provide farming rewards for aETHc/ETH liquidity providers on Curve Finance and many of our employees receive Ankr tokens vested for 6 months as part of their compensation. Other options are possible as long as it does not involve buying Ankr token to sell it right after.

However, a locking mechanism seems more attractive to us than the only Buyback and/or Burn at the moment as we can integrate token locking to some products that we are developing.",2021-06-19 02:19:03
No_Effort_244,"Very well put! I read your recent post on r/CryptoCurrency and was curious to find out more - I am a couple of weeks into my crypto journey, and my learning curve has been stuck at around 89.5 degrees! 

One of the advantages of being a total ""noob"" is that you get a non-biased view of the various factions in the crypto world. Tribalistic is a good word, but I would go so far as calling it a Zoo :)

Some observations from a noob: Clan BTC are convinced of their superiority by fact of being the ""original and best"" coin, and all alt-coins are simply ""shitcoins"". Let's just say that this is not the most welcoming of environments for us noobs, so I quickly exited from there. 

Clan ETH: Much more of a community spirit here, and I was quickly sucked into the project with all the current and future work towards making ETH the top dog in the Crypto world (The various scaling solutions and eventually ETH 2.0). All very exciting. I also dabbled in the world of de-fi via the Polygon side-chain (a cost -effective way of learning the ropes with small amounts!). Forget the zoo - this is a real jungle, complete with crocs and anacondas lurking in the swamp! I have only been doing this for about a week and already been witness to the multi-billion dollar implosion of titan finance! Weekly rug-pulls are par for the course, and nobody even bats an eyelid. A great many gambling-types are being attracted here by the continuous inflating of coin-bubbles and funny tokens at silly APYs. So many sad tales of woe are the net result.  Being risk-averse, this is probably not the place for me.

Clan ADA: To be fair, I haven't spent much time looking into it, but so far I also get a sense that ""Cardashians"" have a distinct  holier than thou attitude towards others and I am still not quite sure what's the point..

Clan Nano: a refreshing welcoming attitude seems to prevail here! I am still learning about the coin, seems to be the friendly underdog-coin, which I can totally get behind. Un-pretentious is also a quality I like, along with the clearly-stated purpose of aiming to be a transactional coin that ANYONE can use as a currency instead of HODLing to infinity and beyond. 

I took the first steps and installed a wallet and used the faucet to get some Nano - it was a doddle, even for a noob! Very impressed by the speed. I will be hanging out here for a while, learning and hopefully contributing what I can at some point. Cheers!",2021-06-19 02:51:28
tulumex,"Mark Cuban has done a lot of positive for the community the last several weeks and it wouldn't be fair to throw him under the bus for any comments regarding regulation. Deep, down, I also support regulation, mostly because I'd rather we get ahead of the curve and lobby for favorable regulations instead of waiting for a scenario where bad regulations are forced upon us. Under the Biden administration, the SEC has been cautious not to disrupt financial innovation and we need to use this opportunity to help them shape the future.

In my opinion, here's one way to think about regulations. One of the most valuable principles of DeFi is that everything is open source. The code and logic for every DeFi app you interact with is published online. This means that, in theory, anyone auditing the code can come up with every possible way the app can be used and misused. In theory, what can go wrong can be predicted in advance. The right type of auditor could have predicted what could go wrong with Titan finance.

Supposedly, our tax dollars finance some of the most advanced Computer Scientists working for the NSA and other government agencies. Since we're already financing coding and other software R&amp;D, there's no reason out tax dollars shouldn't support regulatory agencies who can audit DeFi programs and make the public aware of the risks. Instead of taking the risk of creating regulations which cause a chilling effect and slow down innovation, the government can be active in development and make the public aware of bad code. Since code is logical and transparent, it would decrease the risk of political opinions affecting audit: any risk identified needs to be supported with math and logic.

I'm not saying this is the right way, but this is how I'd lobby the government so that we can move towards creating protections without hurting innovation.",2021-06-19 07:39:33
thomgloams,"This got crazy long. Sorry. I'll put some key points in a reply after this. 
In the meantime, look into how you can figure out if a project is over or under valued by the time you get to it.
-MCap/TVL ratio only a piece of the puzzle
-FDV/TVL is the other (fully diluted value) ratio.
-If both of these are low, less than 1, that's usually good thing.
-Examine the "" Charts "" page and compare different pairs to get a feel for why several metrics are similar yet one has 10k in fees a day and other has 60k. There are several red herrings you'll see. For example, the most swapped coins are the most liquid ones (gas coin , ETH always, and native junk token) and generate the most fees but also attract the most users so you're sharing with more ppl. 
Look up spreadsheets you can just plug numbers into. 
-always check the native token holders wallets on polyscsn. See how many the whales hold. Besides the contract wallets, can 1 whale disrupt the whole thing if they sell?  Look for better distro among holders. 

Take screenshots at every stage before, during and while compounding. I guarantee you will forget what you started with and if the payments are accurate. Compare screenshots with each other. 

Obviously, impermanent loss. This is covered tons of places here. I'll leave that out.  But NATIVE + USDC will incur ALOT of IL swings.  USDT+USDC hardly any.  Then everything in between. 
-The general total Crypto market sentiment matters if you should hold off or rush in. 

Go with Blue Chips if you want to set and forget and just peek in now and again. Low risk low rewards but better than any bank.
Wanna play? Then you gotta be on top of the platforms all day, and have a plan B ready to execute in case you have to exit. You don't wanna waste time doing a whole new vetting process.  Have a backup always. 
- There are fantastic tracker apps to use.
I love yfat

TLDR

May I ask what you expect or hope to experience?  I'm not being snarky I promise you. I'm truly asking bc it seems like none of the responses here are giving any indication that they have an "" expected ROI "" per day/week/month that one calculates on their own before depositing, then see if the numbers match once you begin.  And also, when I see 364% APY my eyes light up too. But it's an exponential distro which means the curve is boring and slow at first, but after TIME, the steep rise appears. But TIME, you don't have. It's a fact we will not realize that 354% interest bc it takes a year to reach it. 
Do a web search for compound interest images and you'll see no matter what the APR/Y is, the curve gets explosive over halfway thru. Or look at an interest table and you'll see it as well.  
The more capital you start with, then the more you gains WILL BE PERCEIVED to be.  1% of 10,000 is $100. That's meaningful to most ppl per day. 1% of 500 is $5.  Much less meaningful even tho it's still 1%. Don't fall for the idea that gains are gains. Bc we still live in a system of accepted value attached to things we need. 
$5 a day + 7 days is $35 a week.  That is TONS TONS more than you'll ever see from a bank. But is it worth the hours of research, farming, reading etc etc.?  Maybe maybe nott.
$100 a day + 7 days is $700 a week.  Well I don't know about you but that's pretty meaningful to me all of a sudden.  That's some life upgrade money if it's regular (it's not) , don't care if you're rich or poor. Everyone can grow $700 free money a week into something way bigger.  So is 1% = to 1% ? Sure.  But the impact is drastically different between 10k and $500. 

TL;DR

I'll be the first to admit that I haven't a clue how it truly truly works beyond the real basic stuff. You know why? It's intentional. It's kept vague in every tokenomics doc. These are old school centralized banking methods under cover of cute graphics and themes. 

It IS real though.. This is how banks make billions. The capital comes from us. The tons of ppl putting in $500, $1000, $2500 etc. It all goes into a pool aka a Money Market. The devs can now leverage millions for a nice return and simply shave off the LP 0.25% fees to all providers. But it's only temporary.  Once the new money stops flowing in, the fun stops. And you gotta get out quickly. 
Just look at any DeFi token chart on tracker apps and you'll see the wild unpredictable nature of these native tokens. 

So, native tokens. It's price is meaningless. It's decided by the circulating supply devs choose divided into the gross amount we invest into the platform + the pre-live capital they raise before going public. Basically this is the initial Market Cap + number of coins (shares) outstanding.  5,000,000 capital let's say.  They could choose to mint 1000 native tokens to give an "" rich "" price of $5000 per token.  Or they can mint 100,000 for a price of $50 to make it seem affordable. Doesn't matter. It has no value except for the day 1 - day 10 or so ppl who ape in whatever they have, get the token rewards ASAP and swap into Stable coin right away.  

This causes price to go down steadily since no smart money or experienced degen is going to HODL that coin. They know it's going to correct fast as supply goes up + minting + ineffective burns + they are REMOVING LIQUIDITY from the pool each time they lock in profit dumping the useless Cat or dog or booboo or doodoo token back to the pool and taking out stablecoins. 

At the same time, tier 2 ppl are reading about the PolyXYZ buzz so they check it out and see the attractive price of the native token so they dump in more actual liquidity, in the hopes that the 357% APY will make them rich quickly since that's like 3 tokens a day x $50 or whatever the price is.  However, they get attached to the project and emotionally vested in the Diamond Hands mentality, and they hoard the native booboo token. Price go up. 

But you're not earning value, you're earning the token + a tiny cut of fees. As your farming grows the price (more or less) seems stable until a whale calls it and swaps 50k of it. On small projects, this will cause a chain reaction and those 6.3688 shooshoo s you were banking on as being $50 ea are now $5 ea.  Sucks but not bad. 

Then tier 3 comes in and sees all this action and they prop up the project a bit longer.  The devs are going hard now, marketing and advertising and creating a buzz for vroovycakes . It's hip to be hodling them. 

You ever see the math functions that the fee distro and rewards are based on? They print it clear as day with a verbal explanation.... Which is fine if you have a Masters Degree in Economics and finance from fkin MIT. It's complete gibberish to any normal, even high IQ person. It APPEARS to be transparent but it's cloaked bc: 

THEY KNOW that only a tiny fraction of ppl MIGHT understand it (these are the MIT graduates) and think it's cute that we, ppl who are NOT master mathematicians think we have any idea how it all actually works. 

BUT you can get a feel for the patterns. Think about it, how long did it take to get 200 POLY-CLONE platforms up? Like locusts.  Fast. The deposit fee here, the performance fee there, the withdrawal fee etc all is priced in.  You can surely come out on top but you need to understand the basic dance, timing, and to not kid yourself that any of these projects are trying to pay you out of the kindness of their heart. And this, these are the nice ones.  I haven't even discussed risks of bad code, rugs, functions that can change dynamically, who controls the pools, it's ENDLESS. 

Don't get me wrong tho - this is not "" malicious "" per se. They tell you upfront you can lose it all.  But we are blinded by the hopes of high returns. 
But guess what?  These returns are only valid OVER TIME.  Compound interests are EXPONENTIAL in that you don't really see the magic until you cross into the law of large numbers area. Yet the one thing you don't have is TIME.  WE ALL KNOW 90% of these things last a month or two tops.  By then the googoo token is worth fractions and the APY has gradually decreased over this time. You are wondering where the gains are... 

There are good ones that last longer but the only reason for that is marketing and good social media presence to keep a constant inflow of fresh capital.  Ignore the special burn rates, lock times, and all the things that they try to stand out from the others. They are all just complex finance formulas with the same end goal.  Make alot of money, re distro some of it to users, to keep them happy and let it ride as long as it will sustain itself. 

So you're wondering still, how are all these ppl on reddit making the big gainz in DeFi?  Well first, you can't trust everything you read. That being said, there are many ppl who have a whole year of DeFi experience where they know what to look for and maybe not exactly how it works but you can start to make educated inferences on the data you CAN interpret. 

This is crazy long. Sorry. I'll put some key points next reply.",2021-06-19 12:58:40
xB_I-O_S,"I farmed cake when APY was 30k%. Not trying to brag just saying. It might not be a scam you might just be early. While finding farms, try to find out if and what project they forked. If that was a success, this might be too on a different network. Cake ist just an uniswap clone at it’s core. Ellipsis finance forked curve finance code and had 3k% APY in the beginning. I farmed that because they airdropped me tokens for my vote-locked curve. Stay away from 2-3gen clones, manage risk and bet LOW. Also auto compounding yield optimizer like beefy finance and autofarm or any other are great for farming these high volatility pools. Mostly they reach these high APY from these auto compounding mechanisms. Make a farming wallet to keep your funds safe while you invest in these new projects. Also try fantom or polygon, BSC is not lucrative right now imo.",2021-06-19 13:13:38

thomgloams,"Hey glad my absurdly long post was helpful for you. After reading your reply tho I think there are alot of plays out there that have reasonable and sustainable ROI ESPECIALLY compared to a bank, and the risk is minimal with blue chips. 
Not financial advice but what I ended up doing was splitting my funds into 3 parts. 50% stable pair like USDC-USDT (or DAI) which will much lessen the IL problem to almost nil.  One can find modest returns (20-40%) on these pairs on sushi, beefy, polycat and wault.  Curve finance also good but complex.  These platforms have been around long enough one can harvest and restake the rewards to get exposure to some more upside (and risk)
Then i take 25% funds (usually core coins like eth, wbtc, and MATIC) and do some decent yield single asset vaults preferable one that rewards in like kind. Might do a pair as well if the markets are nice and liquid and price isn't all nuts like it is now in market. 

Then I sorta play degen with the remaining 25%. Usually scout out newer things and follow up to launch, follow the socials, read the docs do some math and basically just dump whatever looks high and risky.  I watch the native token closely, watch the bug holders and just soak up what I can and lock in profit 2x week.  If anything goes wacky I'm already prepared to be satisfied with what I returned and just assess if I need to make any moves. 

The bread and butter tho is the stable pairs (at least for now) cuz it's generally low math risk. (Just the typical risk of hacks etc) . Oh and I'm only working w a portion of my overall. 

I hate the saying don't risk what you can't lose, bc I hate losing regardless. So I try to limit it and keep a number in mind. I'm not gonna be ok going to zero and I'm not gonna get rich going to 100 but the plan is to find a modest place in the middle.  

PS you should check out Hodlnaut too. Msg me if you want the gist. But I love them and awesome stable returns on 5 major coin.
Cheers and good luck!",2021-06-19 14:42:23
thomgloams,"Guh. This means you can afford to lose 500k.  Which means you have traditional Investments prob valued around 1M at least. Then the emergency fund. Kudos. For real. But less than 0.1% of us can even comprehend that.  500k? Sure.  Risking 500k in risky  DeFi with highly volatile assets?  No. That's called play money. 

Again, congrats tho for real.  But I need to point out that yes on paper 60% = 60% but the value doesn't translate. Money is equal to all of us from $0 to about $1000. Every one of us could survive if we had no choice other than $1000 month. 

10k a month is cushy for some but just right for others. 
100k you instantly see the gap open up.  That's where wealthy ppl are used to having to spend 100k a month just for the services they use. 
Other ppl, 100k a month is like the lottery. 

Law of large numbers. 

So sure 1‰ of $1000 is $10. Can't do anything with that. In 7 days that's $70. That's gas, maybe grocery, basics. We all spend that same and it's not meaningful.

1% of 100,000 is relativly  same but now that's equal to $1000 a day. $7000 week.  That is a major upgrade to most ppls lives and a stress ava worry reducer on orders of magnitude.  For the wealthy it can simply just be the cost of living modestly bc the car payments, house, house 2 &amp; 3, services, etc just cost that much. It's easy less significant. 

Point is 60% gains are not all equal in actual value delivered. Is highly dependent on lifestyle and where time put in meets the reward.  So ppl should keep this in mind and , in a single instance, only use percent to calc your risk reward and know your up and downside.  But then watch your gains losses in fiat once they become useful and only until they become arbitrary. 

Not a single one of these DeFi projects will last long enough for any average person to actually see 1 full year of projected APY realized. And don't forget the curve for compounding is not linear. It starts off slow and flat for 2/5ths the time.  Then the interest finally skips a digit at 3/5s time. That's the catalyst. But it's not til 4th and 5th zone do you see the money mooning.  Most will not make it that long before the protocol fizzle out. 

So ask yourself, do you want decent money tmrw which could also mean you get rugged, hacked, human error, contact fault etc 
Or do you want no realized gains now cuz you don't need them but in 10-15 years you are pretty much guaranteed 7% gains compounded. Hundred of thousands potentially vs. a hundred or so now.  (The answer is leave money to your future self. In return, your future self will give you access to smart debt and leverage.

DeFi is great and all but it's no different than the central banks bc the exact same formulas and Liquidity mining (high yield Money Market funds aka pools) 
The banks advertising for you to open a savings account every other week is the same as devs shilling their pooboo deedioo token with ads and cute pics.  When you open a savings account you are giving the bank thousands that they can play with, fully insured. In return you get crumbs, if that.
These ideas and formulas are made to grow large sums for the banks (devs) and keep the customers just happy enough to keep pouring in thousands of hard cash that they (banks and dev) get for the cost of NADA. 0.1% or 0.25% fees re distro. 

We will never know the exact model, it's too complex and designed by graduate students of finance. With DeFi tho, you get the added "" benefit "" of no one to help, having to become a skilled account, banker, security guard, trader, mathematical scholar as well.  Who the hell wants that? 

We don't.  But them gains!  We can't resist",2021-06-19 19:38:24
magus678,"&gt;But when you asked the moms, 97% of them claimed that they were doing most of the work.

Here is a different survey with similar results about who splits what on dates and household costs. At every delineation women think they pay more than men think they pay. At the largest, where the men paying all vs the women paying none, the gap of acknowledgement is almost double. Which would be a tough one to really get wrong.

Interestingly enough, I am fairly sure this article used to be larger and more damning, but they have shortened it quite a bit and the link to read all the data is now 404. 

[Here is another](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-08/asa-seb080913.php) more academic study that found:

&gt;*Consistent with conventional norms, most men (84 percent) and women (58 percent) reported that men pay for most expenses, even after dating for a while. Over half (57 percent) of women claim they offer to help pay, but many women (39 percent) confessed they hope men would reject their offers to pay, and 44 percent of women were bothered when men expected women to help pay.*

84% vs 58% with that kind of sample size really points to a systemic gap. And while anecdotal, I am fairly sure my own experiences would hold up against actual data that women most certainly *do not* offer to pay over half the time. 

Women do seem to largely exist in a bubble that grades themselves on some sort of curve; they really do seem to believe they are being more egalitarian than they are.",2021-06-19 19:54:55

MetaMask is not user friendly. There’s no doubt about it that Trust Wallet is designed to make everything easier however if you’re using Trust Wallet on iOS the new update will remove your dapp feature and you can’t get it back. You’ll have e to rely on “wallet connect” and that can be a serious pain sometimes. 

Also, Trust is great for BSC, but won’t be compatible with Polygon and Fantom. 

MetaMask is a switch you have to make if you are serious about getting involved in any other networks. MetaMask on a computer is easier than MM on a phone. 

If you ever want to set up a new network on MM, do an internet search for “MetaMask setup (network name)” and there will be a medium post that walks you through it like the one I have posted above.

Volfefe,"If the goal is a high paying job, then I think there are a couple of options.  As someone that graduated around median from a T50 that was the top ranked in the state, my experience in the job market was not pleasant. With your grades, you probably won’t get anything from OCI (if your career services even lets your resume get through;  they plucked out ones that didn’t meet firms GPA requirements).  You basically are going to be working very hard to get grades up and hustle for a job the next two years.  I would seriously consider adding another degree to the JD or dropping out to pursue another graduate program.  It is going to be a lot easier and less work to study for the GMAT/GRE and do a graduate program that won’t fuck you with a curve and has good exit options.  I would look at MBAs, Masters in finance/data analytics/software development.  UVA has a masters of commerce program I desperately wish I had found out about before law school.  I am now considering going part time to get a Masters in Data Analytics at Duke/Berkeley/UVA.  I work at a big 4s consulting/advisory arm and we cannot hire people with data analytics degrees fast enough.  These programs will also actually help you get a job.  Your law schools career office is just going to tell you to go network…. They really are only good for helping students get big law jobs and clerkship, which only the students with great GPAs even qualify for.

If you decide to stay, I think there are two paths you can look at that may help you get a large salary later (but not straight out of law school).  First, you can try to get a job on the hill as a staffer for a senator or congressperson.   You would need to start networking now.  If your school is in or close to DC this is a viable option.  I would just intern as much as possible and try to get a job as a legislative aide after law school.  It won’t pay a lot initially but if you work for the right committees/senators/congressperson you can get a job as a lobbyist or in a in-house government affairs role.

Second, get your grades up and try to get a job at a boutique or gov agency (you will probably only qualify for state level work) that does big lawish type of work.  Look for firms that are made up of old big law partners.  They will care less about grades, and I have seen people make a jump to the mid-law and regional big law firms from there.  For the government work, look for attorney general offices that do employment law, insurance, environmental or another field that the big law firms have practice areas in.  This is not a sure bet path and some of the small law firms can realllyyyyy suck to work for.  Remember, everyone is going to be applying for jobs and the only real differentiators employers have is grades, pre law school work experience (if any), and connections.

My experience with being around median grades wise sucked big time.  The market is way too crowded and going to the T50 was not as big of a differentiator than I expected.  I lost out to the local T3 candidates in a lot of cases just because they had an alumni connection.  The T50 really only seemed to get a couple more big law firms at oci than the T3.  But that only helps if you are in the top 15% of the class…",2021-06-20 23:50:41
WorshipTheSunGods,"&gt; There is almost no crypto whose price is based on its demand in a certain application atm. 

Aave, yEarn, comp, curve and maker vaults all have TVL ranging from multi-hundred millions to billions. Look at this:

https://defipulse.com/yearn.finance

TVL in yEarn vaults has been increasing non-stop, even post-crash. And if this isn't a viable metric then look at tokens which generate revenue:

https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/protocol-revenue

These tokens are literally generating revenue that goes straight to liquidity providers, stakers and lenders. There are tokens that have value due to rooted fundamentals - a huge shift from the paradigm in 2017 where your statement would have been correct and demand was dominated by solely by speculation. But we now have other applications arising which do give tokens intrinsic value and this should not be forgotten.",2021-06-21 01:54:09
Anlarb,"&gt; Yes, you can learn a more in demand skill.

An individual can, the bottom 50% of wage earners can't all clown car into plumbing.

&gt; nah. there is no conspiracy here.

Never attribute to malice that which can be attributed to incompetence.

&gt; People move into and out of income brackets. You can take a snapshot of the country at any given decade and say these people are middle class, but its rather pointless because it will be an entirely different set of people a decade later or a decade before.

Thats nice and has nothing to do with the point- this pots still boiling, frog.

&gt; If you want to talk about consumption levels, sure. The middle class consumes more now than ever before.

What specifically are you talking about, per capita? Are you defining rich as the middle class?

&gt; If GDP grows 7% a year for a decade, the standard of living for people in the middle class 10 years from will be double what it is today. But it won't be the same people.

Guy, ""same people"" is a red herring. Median wage is 34k, thats Poor.

https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/family-finance/articles/where-do-i-fall-in-the-american-economic-class-system

&gt; You can have all the free time you want. Just depends on what material standard of living you're comfortable with.

Sure, as a bum living under a bridge you can, but being homeless takes 40 years off your life expectancy.

If you want things, you need enough money to pay for them, thats what a living wage does.

&gt; There are supply constraints. In my neighborhood, you can't add more housing because the area is low density zoned. So the price of an additional unit is effectively infinitely high. The supply curve is effectively vertical. Plenty of room for speculation.

We could try punishing speculation, get investors back into the business of investing in factories and other profitable endeavors, instead of just beating the middle class like a pinata.",2021-06-21 08:04:55

Right now it’s very clear we are in a downturn (and might be for some time) so I wanted to say that there’s nothing wrong with converting your crypto to stablecoins and using them on defi protocols to gain interest. Right now it’s not a bad strategy and there are some big liquidity incentives happening on Matic (Polygon) using Curve Finance, AAVE, and Kyber Network (“Rainmaker” liquidity boost pending June 30th). These are all battle-tested, reliable protocols with competent teams - and Polygon has such low fees that folks like us can make a ton of transactions for nothing.

Fatigued_Otter,"Thank you for your kind words. As far as balance not moving, its the same as paying $500/mo interest payments on credit cards, $500/mo interest payments on mortgages, and $500/mo interest payments on cars. Mathematically there’s no difference, you’re in a contract with a rate and your balance is just a function of the payments you make or don’t make. That’s not the question here. 

If you take out a car loan or mortgage you cannot afford, this will also happen, just like taking out student loans that you cannot afford. Tangent, but the biggie (and imo, atrocity, though I understand it was to get enough political will to pass the NDEA circa 1958ish mid-Cold War) is the lack of discharge in bankruptcy.

Student loan forgiveness would be great, but the reality is even if that happens there will be people taking them out in the future as well. So the question for me is longer-sighted than forgiveness, it’s where does our system go wrong as a root cause? Is it that student loans of that magnitude and interest simply shouldn’t have been offered because they are not collectible? And if so, do people enter into them because the perceived value of certain degrees is inflated? Or is it because they are not aware of the nature of the obligation (eg can’t discharge in bankruptcy, seeing a payment schedule)? Or do we lack education in personal finance (“if I borrow money can I pay it back, and how to I do that math?”) A combo of the above?

The next question of course is how do you amend policy to fix it going forward. Lowering the interest rate and/or capping amounts that can be loaned seems easy, but would have to be offset with federal tax hikes elsewhere to pay for the subsidy (ideally with a more progressive tax curve, though we’ve seen it’s frustratingly difficult to get the political will to do that). 

Thoughts?",2021-06-22 07:06:40
Kashmir79,"There is definitely something to the idea that as a company grows larger and scales up the index into the mega cap zone, it has proportionally less room to grow relative to the total market cap and therefore lower return potential. For example, with a $2.2 trillion valuation, Apple can only grow roughly another 25x before it represents the value of the entire US stock market so that is the upper limit of its growth. But a smaller company could easily grow 10,000x and then some. So an optimal weighting that accounts for the greater growth potential of smaller companies is probably going to look something like an elongated bell curve, with the apex somewhere amidst the large caps. But this is well outside my very modest knowledge of finance and there are thousands of brilliant mathematical minds studying it every day so have to I’ll leave it to them to figure out the right models and just stick with what I can get from my 401k.",2021-06-22 11:00:13

Gallusrostromegalus,"Related Things that could definitely be mistaken as ""Cursed By Genius"", that are way, WAY more common:

\-Having ADHD, Autism or another major learning disorder which can give you a weird advantage at academics, but you still feel the loneliness of being ND in a Neurotypical world.

\-Having ADHD/Autism and having a hyperfixation that is considered 'intellectual' (chess, calculus, latin, etc) but not that common.  It leads to feeling isolated because it's hard to find friends that share your interests/bond with people that don't and having a superiority complex which is a nasty combo to get out of.

\-Having a hyperfixation not generally considered 'intellectual' (NASCAR, card games, klingon etc.) and feeling isolated because it's hard to find friends that share your interest/bond with people who don't, and an inferiority complex, which is even worse.

\-Having anxiety and overthinking everything

\-Having anxiety and constantly feeling like you're the only person taking anything seriously enough.

\-Having low emotional intelligence and getting frustrated when you can't reason your way through basic social interactions

\-Having really high social intelligence and being great at social interactions, but also like you're constantly doing the heavy lifting for other people instead of the mutualism they all get to expirience

\-being really skilled at something that's in very high demand (Programming, electrical work, finance, art, education, home repair etc.) which gets you a ton of attention but also can leave you feeling like there's a ton of work to be done and you're the only one up for it, if only someone else would learn this and come help.  not to mention how this acts as a beacon for choosing beggars and people who want you to work for free, which is also frustrating.

\-Being an absolute fucking moron and not sharp enough to realize that the reason nobody thinks the way you are is because you're a moron, not a genius. (AKA, ""wrong end of the bell curve syndrome"")

Every real Genius I've ever met- people who are genuinely great at a wide range of skills, sharp-witted and intellectually curious- know that there is no such thing as a truly stupid person, just someone who knows different things than you-even your most fuckwitted friend knows how to do stuff you don't, are PROFOUNDLY AWARE they don't know everything and are really, really glad to know people who have wildly different life expiriences and skillsets than they do, because as one of my polymath friends put it ""I have three degrees and NONE of them can help me fix a broken toilet"".

So I don't think ""Cursed by Genius"" is real because real geniuses are aware they're also idiots, but ""Cursed by Undiagnosed Mental Health Issue"" and ""Cursed by Poor Social Skills"" sure as hell are.",2021-06-22 18:36:43

everynewdaysk,"**Oil prices are likely to keep rising toward $100 a barrel while a cool-off in commodity prices won’t last,** leaders of key firms said at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday. The head of Royal Dutch Shell Plc said governments will need to help companies cut customer emissions.  
  
Earlier, one of Deutsche Bank AG’s top shareholders signaled his backing for consolidation in Europe’s financial services industry, arguing that the continent’s lenders need scale to compete globally. Billionaire investor Michael Novogratz said he prefers Bitcoin to buying gold.  
  
The three-day event kicked off on Monday, with billionaire investor Ray Dalio and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers telling the Forum the U.S. is headed for a period of overheating and inflation that could threaten the recovery.  
  
The Qatar Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Investment Promotion Agency Qatar and Media City Qatar are underwriters of the Qatar Economic Forum, Powered by Bloomberg.  
  
**Commodity Cool-Off Won’t Last, Glencore CEO Says (7:30 p.m. Doha)**  
Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive officer of Glencore Plc, told the Forum that Chinese efforts to cool commodity markets, including releasing metals from its strategic stockpile, will be short lived.  
  
Glasenberg said China’s efforts are a “short-term phase” and that the country will have to move to restock strategic supplies that it feeds into the market in order to cool prices. Glasenberg said he expects commodity prices to stay strong for a good while longer, with both China and the U.S. stimulating their economies.  
  
For the first time in over a decade China has pledged to release metals stockpiles if it needs to. While planned sales to end users in China could help boost domestic supply, analysts have questioned the country’s ability to influence any uptick in copper demand seen elsewhere.  
  
Ben van Beurden, chief executive officer of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, said the company can probably fulfill stringent new targets for its carbon emissions: at a push, he can see a “pathway” to cutting them 45% by 2030, as mandated recently by The Hague.  
  
But he cautioned that it would a “different story” if the oil major is obligated to tackle emissions by its customers -- known as Scope-3. Shell can go some of the way by innovating new products and tweaking its business model, van Beurden said, but the “lion’s part” will come down to government policies. These could include measures that encourage the adoption of electric vehicles.  
  
“This is not a challenge for one company,” van Beurden said at Forum on Tuesday. “It is a systems challenge that we all have to embrace.”  
  
**Qatar Reveals Multiple Bids for LNG Expansion Project (7:10 p.m. Doha)**   
Qatar has received interest from prospective investors in its project to expand liquefied natural gas production amounting to double what it was seeking, said Energy Minister Saad Al-Kaabi.  
  
Royal Dutch Shell PLC, TotalEnergies SE and Exxon Mobil Corp. were among the companies that submitted bids to partner on the project, he said. The project will lift Qatar’s annual LNG output to 110 million tons from 77 million tons, and LNG buyers have offered to receive “double what we require,” he said.  
  
**Oil Prices to Keep Rising, Energy Bosses Say (7 p.m. Doha)**  
The leaders of some of the world’s biggest oil companies said crude prices are likely to keep rising as a lack of investments affects future supply, joining major commodity traders and banks in predicting the current rally has more room to run.  
  
**There’s “quite a chance” crude will reach $100 a barrel, TotalEnergies SE Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said at the Forum.**  
  
The energy transition means there has not been enough investment in oil and gas projects and that could push prices higher, Qatar’s Energy Minister Saad Al-Kaabi said.  
  
**Novogratz: Long-Bitcoin Trumps Long-Gold (11:25 a.m. Doha)**  
**Billionaire investor Novogratz said he looks at Bitcoin as “digital gold.” “If you’re going to be long gold, Bitcoin is a better version because it’s got the same macro tailwinds but it is also very early in the adoption curve.”**  
  
“Crypto is a luxury in the developed markets, it’s a necessity in the developing markets, where you’ve got currencies that devalue 20% to 30% every year,” Novogratz said. For the general user of crypto, though, Bitcoin and Ethereum is “probably enough,” he said.

Last week's Fed meeting was undeniably hawkish. As expected short term yields (2Y 5Y) spiked up which is logical. What I don't understand is how the longer end yields (10Y 30Y) are dropping, and how it all interacts with a flattening yield curve. What's the market saying?",2021-06-23 07:13:43
Adderalin,"TMF is amazing. It shot up a few days ago due to interest rate announcement via the Fed and suddenly I'm sitting quite nicely on some major gains and if it continues the July rebalance will be selling TMF for UPRO! 

It sounds illogical but it's the yield curve flattening. There are a ton of trade tactics that you actually want to be LONG on 20+ year treasuries such as the [barbell strategy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbell_strategy)

&gt;In finance, a barbell strategy is formed when a trader invests in long- and short-duration bonds, but does not invest in intermediate-duration bonds. This strategy is useful when interest rates are rising; as the short term maturities are rolled over they receive a higher interest rate, raising the value

In this case with TLT/TMF the Fed's hawkish signal shows they're not going to let inflation get out of control and so yields dropped, which raises bond prices! There is less inflation fear in the market.",2021-06-23 12:04:43

In a recent r/finance post about Japan (https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/nyq2xv/saving_japan_from_fiscal_collapse/), there was a lot of tut-tutting about Japan's supposed inhumane working conditions, how it led to low birth rate and a supposed fiscal collapse.

The difference is much narrower than you imagine.

I guess that's not terribly relevant, but it is funny that we have another area of comparison where the US is rapidly closing its gap with Japan; national debt.

Alex-From-The-North,"From a pure money-driven standpoint, I would not be sure if it is even possible to finance an expensive deck by winning packs or prices in FNMs.

I totally get your point, but I would think that the average expected value of doing well in Tournaments is not enough to buy you a collection within a reasonable amount of time. Thats at least the experience I made with the regional tournaments in my area (Germany).

Not to mention you will have a learning curve for your deck and getting back into the format, which will cost you a lot of games in the beginning and lowering your winnings even more.

&amp;#x200B;

So my suggestion would still be to either find a deck you enjoy playing within a fixed budget, or start saving for a more expensive deck and starting with a budget variant of this exact deck.

MoistGochu,"I can give some information related to your questions.

Ignore the work-from-home increasing amount of miles driven.

Oil going to 100 dollars depends on OPEC and Asian demand in the near future.  Because oil demand is very inelastic, the crude price depends on the excess supply and demand.  Because long cycle investment in oil is dead, oil will structurally get a higher floor in terms of price due to the destruction of capex.  The structural oversupply from overproduction in Permian shale is all gone and the OECD crude inventory levels are about to head lower than 2015 levels.  Crude drawdown is accelerating and will continue to do so through the second half of this year.  This last week, we had a drawdown from the SPR to commercial inventory and still had over a 7 million barrel drawdown in crude.

Second very important fundamental is the backwardation curve on the WTI and Brent.  This curve has gotten extremely steep recently and will likely continue to stay this way.  With a curve like this, huge influx of oil capex will be discouraged.

A little more drilling is required if we want to prevent oil going above 100.  I'm already hearing from friends that Bakken and Athabasca is already seeing an uptick in oil production.  Don't be bearish though, this production won't make a dent in the rising oil demand which will likely rise by 3 mmb/d.  US will at max bring up just a little over 1 mmb/p in new supply.  New supply is also constrained by banks not wanting to finance new oil production due to ESG concerns.

As for current capex, exxon and other oil majors will continue drilling and investing in their offshore assets to maintain current production.",2021-06-24 10:03:06

wc49358,"As a major user of polygon I can argue this.

Pros:  
 I wanted to get into defi and this was the best place to learn.  Mistakes were not very costly.  Learn the ins and outs of approvals... etc

It had the best yields for a bit with the matic promotions.

It ""was"" fast until the bot congestion


Cons:
Polygon could suffer a 51% attack.  Matic prices were dropping and it was a small fear but it was a fear.  A whale could possibly buy up a very large portion and steal the billions of dollars on the network.

8 users have a multi sig for the entire network.  We know 4 of the 8 - founders of polygon.  1 is a curve founder,  I think 1 is aave founder.  (Don't quote me)  you need 5 out of the 8 to control the entire chain.  Possible kidnaps to force others into compliance ""could"" be a possibility.  I know its out there... but for a couple billion?   People have done worse for less.  

The last few weeks have been horrible to use.  Binance chain has been faster.   Yes the iron finance thing was horrible all 5 public rpc were a joke.  Even some private ones.   When it all came down to pulling out and removing liquidity it was near impossible.

Its not ""layer 2"" yet.  Its more of a side chain... layer 2 hasn't been implemented yet. (Honestly i rather them focused on more stable RPC for smother chain use)

Overall:

 I still use polygon heavily, I just understand the risks.  When btc started crashing and people were pulling out... I felt MUCH safer with my funds in the ethereum network than the polygon chain.  Its still growing and I will continue to use it.  More blue chip projects are coming on board which are all good signs.   More bridges , more adoptions... it's all good.  

Currently, fantom network has the best yields for stable coins so alot of liquidity jumped ship to that chain.  I feel safer on polygon than fantom.

wiegleyj,"Yep. Email the finance department. They will likely give you advice and not a permission numbers. The authority of the permission numbers typically rests with the instructor and not with the department office.

Further more most departments will wait until after registration to start dealing with permission numbers. During registration appointment periods needing a permission number is a sign you shouldn't have gotten into the class. It was filled up by students with a greater need than you (they were closer to graduation, this is why seniors get the earliest registration windows) or you didn't satisfy the prerequisites and you are supposed to be taking those instead. So, once registration is over it usually when we really start figuring out which permission number requests are valid and worth providing for.

badelectricity,"I think you might be hung up on the idea of cryptocurrency as ""currency,"" when that's not really what they are, or at least they aren't currencies like the USD or Euro are. It's consensus now that Bitcoin is a store of value asset, like a precious metal. Ether is a utility token without which you can't use the Ethereum network. Neither have grown to the point to having utility as an everyday medium of exchange and so people aren't using them as currencies. Sure there's some black market usage as currency, but that's only due to necessity, not because crypto is currently suited for it. Cryptocurrencies have various different monetary qualities paired with technological utilities and are pretty unique and novel compared to ""traditional"" investment asset classes.

The US dollar is generally a bad investment due to its monetary policy, inflation, and its status as the reserve currency of the world. Though it might be a pretty good investment if your nation's local currency is about to be hyperinflated. Bitcoin has a hard cap monetary policy which makes it finitely scarce, and Ethereum is about to implement token burns per transaction which could make it a deflationary asset. So they don't possess the same monetary qualities that make the USD a bad investment (also they aren't tied at the hip to the global oil market or backed by government guns) and are actually kind of the opposite.

As far as the real world ""value"" i think the tangible values of BTC and ETH are tied to (1) the physical resources (energy, computers) used to create the networks (and I think it's exciting that there isn't a central body that ""owns"" all of those computers), (2) the human power invested in its development, and (3) the network effects that incentivize expanded adoption. The price movement of these assets is wild, but user growth has consistently risen and continues to do so, even through the recent market collapse. 

I will say that I like lots of other crypto projects and own a few altcoins, but I don't think any of them other than BTC, and very recently ETH, have proven themselves beyond the point of being mainly speculative because none of them have achieved a real network effect, which I think is crucial to tangible value. That said, I think speculation exists on a curve and crypto is on the riskier end of the curve, while other investments are ""less risky"" (maybe, looking at you, ""everything bubble"") but still exist on the speculation curve because no one really knows the future, we just play probabilities, and the probabilities of BTC and ETH sticking around for at least the next decade seem to be growing. 

But you said it yourself that you believe digital currency is the future of human transaction, so why wouldn't you want exposure to the space? A non-zero allocation to Bitcoin is even being recommended by many legacy finance entities these days. It could even be argued (with math) that it's riskier to have no exposure to crypto moving forward.",2021-06-25 11:44:45
PlasticPegasus,"I guess the key considerations here are:

1. your appreciation of risk

2. the depreciation against any finance arrangement you may have.

On point 1, software issues are quite common on LR products (AFAIK) and so you should either take a look at third party options to solve (of which there are many), or factor the dealership cost of fixing (975AED diagnosis fee is absurd! - I bet they just unplugged the battery and back again). For example, there are myriad specialists who'll sell you a genuine, OEM battery for less than the dealer will charge.

Also bear in mind that as your car gets older, LRs have a reputation for being maintenance intensive. So you should factor in maintenance costs (tyres / battery / brakes / servicing etc) during the remainder of your planned tenure with the car. And calculate your total cost ownership accordingly.

On point 2, a key decision factor is whether you have negative equity on any finance. Certainly, the car will be easier to sell now with a good chunk of warranty left etc, but if you're still under water with it, then this might not be a wise time to get shot. Especially, as any replacement car will have the same initial heavy depreciation curve. If you're not owing any money on it, then the simple equation is whether your monthly cost of upkeep for basic maintenance and the cost of depreciation could be mitigated by getting into another car, versus the utility you enjoy from your range Rover.

TLDR: There are plenty third party options for software and basic maintenance items. 

If you're in negative equity on the car still, then keep it at least until the warranty runs out and reassess then.",2021-06-25 11:57:56

DarkBert900,"I'm subscribed to a bunch of news letters, including one from Mark Rubenstein. In his latest edition, which came out yesterday, he pointed out an interesting point about stocks:

&gt;It's hard to believe now, but equities were once a new asset class, at least in institutional eyes. A few years ago some finance professors conducted an appraisal of John Maynard Keynes’ performance as manager of his Cambridge college endowment from 1921 to 1946. Keynes’ top-down macro approach generated disappointing returns in the 1920s, but when he switched to stocks – not permitted by many other colleges until later – his performance improved. “Keynes’ great insight was to appreciate the previously overlooked attractions of a new asset class for long-term investors, namely equities.” 

It got me thinking how incredible the past two decades have been in our understanding of finance, including personal finance. We saw the decline in the appeal of bonds, savings and cash deposits because of a low interest rate environment, which seemingly came out of nowhere but now seems like it will stay forever. 

Why wouldn't the same thing happen to stocks? We already see Japan, a country ahead of Europe and the U.S. in numerous ways, including the central banking policy, ageing and a delayed recovery in the stock market, have the BoJ pump money into stocks/ETFs. It's not so far-fetched to think that the fate of bonds and savings cannot transition to stocks and subsequently will deteriorate forward looking returns to the point where (ordinary) people have to move up the risk curve once again for their savings. 

Perhaps subordinated stocks, junior equity or certificates, perhaps other assets for a sense of compounding interest. We take so many topics and principles for granted in personal finance, while most haven't been around long enough for us to fully develop a coherent framework around their stability or dynamics.",2021-06-26 16:17:14

Rtb3422,"Private Equity. This term is fairly loose tho, as many firms in the alternative asset management space have both hedge fund and PE capability. Perfect example is Elliott Mgmt. These are fairly generic terms to describe large asset managers that are not attached to investment banks, typically harboring institutional or family office money, have less then 100 LPs and invest in companies. I used to cover these firms when in worked in finance.

Easiest way to equate: Private equity invests money into non-public companies in the hope ~5-7 years (J-curve) turning the company into a profit for them, then exiting (selling).

Hedge funds: investing that same money but into public companies, with likely much shorter term time horizons (30 days - 1 yr). They’re are many flavors of these funds, market neutral, global macros, distressed, activist (also PE), quant, relative value.

Then all serve a different purpose, but the main ones are to diversify (with higher returns, and therefore risk) large institutional capital bases (like the FDNY pension fund).

They are the Buyside as they take positions in these companies, as where I worked (MM investment firm) was sellside as we work for these and Corp clients and provide services (not capital we are investing ourselves) but rather their capital and advise it.

somewhere_somehow1,"Purchasing a house is certainly an investment, but it's also not as simple as ""renting = bad, buying = good"". It depends on your long term goals and how intentional you are about either strategy. Intentional renting can be seen kind of like insurance, you have a fixed cost for living expenses and aren't on the hook for 15-30 years of a mortgage. You won't have unexpected costs (fixing plumbing, repairing the roof, purchasing new appliances when old ones break, etc...) and you have more flexibility to change your living situation if/when life throws you a curve ball.

It does come down to the ""personal"" aspect of personal finance. Other options to spend the $ you put into a down payment could have been to have a bigger emergency fund, Roth IRA, a mutual fund, and/or start your own business or a side hustle to increase income, etc... I'm not saying any of these are better or worse, it depends on who you are. I will say that there seems to be a common cultural belief that the best thing you can do with your money is buy a house.

Lewis_ABD,"I’m sure they could throw some more finance in, but short of becoming a professional team it’s difficult to say where that finance can go - other than into coaches to help get the best out of local youngsters. 

Because ultimately it’s going to be pretty difficult convincing a player from Glasgow or Edinburgh to turn their whole life upside down in order to move up here to either not get payed at all or only get paid enough for it to be a nice wee side earner (I’m not sure the situation). 

I suppose they could make it worth their while for current players to stay. Plenty talented younger players who could just throw the club a curve ball by going “actually I’m away to Glasgow for Uni”",2021-06-28 16:11:12

And an ever growing cohort of 65+ folks. 
I want to be clear: you’re looking at low % adoption from each of those crowds which eats into that 66 MM

However: even if you say 40 million, for easy maths and accounting for demographic impact on adoption, and each of those puts $100 into crypto ( being mindful that considering a bell curve: there will be some small tail of adopters putting significantly more than $100 in. ) this brings an additional $4B to the market!",2021-06-28 21:32:15

MrMhmToasty,"If he enjoys these classes and thinks it's a good use of his free time, go for it! I would especially recommend taking some proof-based classes, since almost all Caltech math classes are proof-based and trip up a lot of freshmen who have never been exposed to the style of thinking.

However, it's ultimately not necessary. I completed my HS's math curriculum, culminating in AP Calc B/C and AP Stats my senior year. Got a 5 in Calc and a 4 in Stats. The SAT II Subject test in Math is important, with the average at Caltech being an 800 I think, so that's a pretty important one to nail (although one of my classmates got a 730 or so and still got in). I would say the average person at tech goes through something like this, so your son is ahead of the curve!

Ultimately the most important thing is that your son displays a real love for whatever field he intends to go into. Caltech can be really brutal and, if you're not committed to your major, it can be easy to lose motivation and interest in it (lots of people end up switching to something like finance or computer science). Taking college-level classes is a great strategy for showing this commitment, but so is something like setting up a tutoring program at his HS/in your local area. 

Best of luck with the rest of HS and the application process!!",2021-06-29 07:08:31
nightsky2020,"(Pasted below find some information I have been attempting to share)

The lockdowns are not public health policy, they are part of a globalist coup\\Putsch entitled 'the great reset' which will be 'the new normal'.

They began having their propagandists whisper these terms in our ears even before the first 2 weeks to slow the curve were up. We have seen elderly well-connected plutocrats like Nancy Pelosi ignore the lockdowns.

the lockdowns are a psychological warfare attack. This is the only way to make sense of them. From a health policy point of view makes no sense. From an economic POV makes no sense unless you understand how global finance works post-LIBOR fixing revelations and the 2008 bailouts.

Covid = globalist psyop.

BigFinance_Guy,"I am uncertain how the curriculum has changed for '22 but the four topics you've covered were the four most difficult in my opinion. If derivatives is causing you as much trouble as it was for me, I advise watching MM's reading video on the topic. It provided a lot of clarity for me. The other three topics took a couple extra pass throughs, and a lot of extra time to make sure I understood the material and questions. 

Equity is *very* straight forward, despite the breadth of material covered. PM can be confusing, but once you understand the limitations in ways questions can be asked, I think it's less daunting. Economics is confusing but when I focused on material by reading (rather than economics as a whole) it became more transparent. AI is easy - there were only two calculation intensive readings with concepts relatively simple to grasp (except for industry REIT table). Corporate finance was pretty calculation intensive with some easy to follow concepts. 

Keep in mind all of this commentary is my sole opinion. You're very far ahead of the curve (in my opinion) having covered the four more difficult sections with over 7 months to go. Good luck!",2021-07-01 19:52:44

ptchinster,"&gt; Every day I work with families who are stuck in the poverty trap with basically no way out.

I have tangentle experiences with this, and i am looking for volunteer opportunities to help educate people on finances and accounting. Sadly, i dont have a series 7 or 63 or any of those, finance is more of a hobby for me, and we have strict laws on giving financial advice here in the US. Ive heard people tell me ""im in debt to the IRS. So what? All those tech giants are in debt too!"". A business owner legit did not understand why Google might issue low yield bonds to grow their business and have cash on hand, vs owing the IRS money because your accountant fucked up your payroll. That is the state of financial education in this country.

&gt; but for argument's sake, how should someone go about gaining new ones when the price of education is so ridiculous?

I forget where but also ITT i commented about what we need to do. Education is high for a few reasons - get the government out of it, make colleges cosign loans. Not everybody needs a 4 year degree, trade schools are fantastic. Google is trying to condense 4 year computer science degrees into &lt;1 year bootcamps that teach what you need to know. Theres lots of things we can do here.

When i worked at the grocery time, i was also in school. In school, there were people there who worked full time jobs, had kids, AND showed up for class. You can do it - it just takes work. Get rid of needless spending - phones, cable, subscription services, people spend way too much on them. Learn to live within your means. Society forgot how to do that recently.

&gt; The whole roommate argument is crazy, and the solution is out of the hands of people like you and I - we need to build affordable housing

If you are suggesting the government should be building housing, im 100% against that. As for private developers, i would happily invest in a complex, but i am going to have a high bar for entry - i dont want just anybody to move in and squat. Id also do it in a state where squatters dont have rights - squatting laws in places like CA are batshit insane, and discourage homeowners. Additional risk to the owners means higher costs for the renters.

&gt; ""because you're too poor to buy food"" isn't a good reason to have to have a garden

Its not just that. Its because its healthier for your body, its healthier for the environment (if you provide 10% of your own food thats all food that doesnt need to be shipped and trucked around the country burning gas). It takes stess off of the supply chain, reduces our dependence on foreign goods (chinese slave labor).

&gt; Also, there's a learning curve - what should I do if I lose half my garden due to pests, weather, etc.?

Yes, living can require work. You wont be an expert in 1 season. Better to start now. Our society has also lost these skills and it will take a while to rebuild them.

&gt; keep the masses from moving up through the ranks

Up what ranks? Im sorry if your goal isnt ""be more self reliable, have land to protect and live on, and have a peaceful life"". People who want to live in a condo in NYC with 50 people within 100ft of you, people above, below, to the right and left of you, arent living how humans should be. Let their problems manifest to themself - they will have higher rates of mental health issues, have to pay more in taxes, contribute to global warming more, they are the burden of society.

akill33,"Great question and honestly that argument is the thinnest for me too. For larger installs they often need to upgrade meters and transformers (so power can flow both ways). Also they liked to have a remote controllable switch to disconnect the asset if need be. 

Arguably a distributed resource should alleviate transmission and distribution congestion, but its not necessarily true if we want the utility to be the power provider of last resort. A couple years ago I did try looking into how much of an issue this is and what I found is the biggest cause of solar curtailment was not over production, but rather congestion in the system. Basically we sometimes turn off solar because we cant get those kWh to where we need to. 

Under NEM 2.0 the IOU's reviewed each and every interconnection agreement and often delayed projects to do interconnection studies around these points (especially when project size was larger than 1 MW). I do hope that if the avoided cost math takes this into account, they get rid of that. Nothing worse than being a salesperson having to explain to a customer we don't know when we can install because PG&amp;E wants to do a study. 

I do agree on your view of the duck curve though. Right now a good fit for solar is if you have the real estate for it and can afford the upfront cost (or pass the credit worthiness test to get it financed). I do see how it can be perceived as wrong that customers that can afford this pass on these hidden costs to the customers that cant afford/finance distributed resources.

r-2-eth-2,"**3 reasons why analysts are turning bullish on Curve Finance**

&gt; Three reasons why Curve DAO Token is attracting the attention of analysts include attractive yields offered to tokenholders who participate in staking, competition for CRV deposits on multiple decentralized finance platforms and healthy earnings for the Curve protocol as a whole despite the market downturn. The root source of analysts' bullish point of view comes from CRV's attractive yield when staking the token on the Curve platform as well as other DeFi protocols. Users who opt to stake their tokens directly on Curve Finance are offered an average APY of 21% and are given vote-escrowed CRV in exchange, which allows participation in governance votes that take place on the protocol.

MachineTeaching,"&gt;What (if they exist) are the more rigorous economic definitions of a buyer's and a seller's market? How are they quantified? Does it have to do with equilibrium of supply and demand, where there is a shift in the demand- or supply curve (or alternatively quantities demanded or supplied)? Or does it have to do with ""extra"" market forces, meaning bargaining power that takes the situation away from equilibrium?

""Buyer's/seller's market"" is really not a term economists use a lot. Or at all. There is no ""official"", more precise definition as far as I am aware. It's more of a loose term used colloquially, maybe by finance people as well, but economists generally would use entirely different terms.

Most of the time I'd say ""excess supply/demand"" is more appropriate terminology.

&gt;What does this mean for the labor market? How does one ""count"" supply and demand? Does one count the number of workers versus the number of jobs? The number of workers versus the number of employers? The number of hours demanded versus the number of hours supplied?

If we go by the excess supply/demand definition, that's not really sufficient.

One might be inclined to think that a monopoly would constitute a seller's market because the seller has the advantage. But that's not correct.

Excess supply/demand is a disequilibrium between the goods demanded and supplied. A monopoly however leads to a shift in the supply curve.

It's this for monopoly:

https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/256/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-11-at-10.03.48-PM.png

And this for the excess demand:

https://www.ezyeducation.co.uk/images/Lexicon_Images/ED.jpg

A monopoly produces less and charges a higher price than a perfectly competitive market. Excess demand happens because it takes time for markets to find a new equilibrium.

Anyway, to get back on track, for a labor market, you would look at the number of jobs that exists, and the number of people looking for these jobs. It's a market for labor, not a market for *employers*, the number of employers doesn't matter, the number of jobs does.

What are the implications of that? Well, if there is ""too much"" labor, the price of labor will go down, if there's too little, the price will go up, until you reach a new equilibrium where demand=supply.",2021-07-02 17:28:19
erichkeane,"FWIW, if you wanted to still get the tax 'credit' money, you could have leased the car.  Kia Finance actually gets the tax credit in that case, then gives it to you as a 'lease incentive'.

okaydredre,"It's a balancing act. On the one hand, yes. That would be intuitive. On the other, defi is relatively new and the first movers win overall. Look at what this ecosystem is right now:

YDLY is first to market on Algorand. Nipping on their heels is Algodex, Algomint and Folks.Finance all coming in months. Not all fighting for the exact same market share, but there's a good chance one or none of them survive after 5-10 years.

Compound this with having to catch up to Aave, Compound and Curve. Right now, ETH fees are pricing out casual users. Defi on Algorand right now looks great because of low fees. But if ETH2 hits and fees mostly disappear? 

And then there's the Cardano network. Smart contracts go live in the next few months. MELD finance just started their ISO on the first and will be live by end of year. Liqwid Finance and so many more launching Q1 of 2022.

PROB40Airborne,"Agree. Nothing wrong with buying a nice car at all! 

Get the A3, great. Spec the exact car you want, then just find a 12 month *identical* copy of that with 15/20k miles and pay 30-40% less for it. 

Other than the number plate there is absolutely no difference. It’s not even that you’re getting a newer model. They’re *identical*. It’ll be valeted before you buy it and probably have the same ribbon on the bonnet, it’s the same. If you’re worried about what the neighbours will think you can always stick a gash personalised plate on it. 

No Audi is going to break in a big way in the first five years if it’s serviced properly and not hammered. 

Coming to sell, your 5 year car will probably get 85-90% of the value of the 4 year old car with 15/20K less miles on it. The curve really does flatten after the first few years. 

As to the comparison, all depends on what deals your credit allows you to get, dealer discounts etc. Servicing packs are effectively insurance products. You’re hoping it breaks a lot and they cover it all, they’re assuming it won’t. The house always wins overall so, on average, it’s a bad product. Peace of mind can’t be valued though.

But, she wanted me to be ahead of the curve should something happen to the old car.  PLUS, she was pregnant when we bought the car, so we now had younger drivers to take it over.

I decided what I wanted.  It was not available anywhere in the states.  I found a dealer who would bring it from overseas (where the brand is manufactured) without a contract.  Once it was here, I confirmed the price, and wife and I drove up to the dealership.  Low and behold, what we hadn't settled was that I was intending to pay cash (well, write a check).  They were including manufacturer incentives for financing.

So I almost walked away, but decided, yeah, I can do this.  I was told the minimum that I could finance and get the incentive, and then I confirmed that I could pay off the entire amount whenever I wanted without extra fees or anything.

* Or lets say your BBEG sets up a ""philanthropic and humanitarian project"" to uplift a group of people. But to make the project financially solvent the BBEG permits the imprisonment of workers who do not produce enough. NPCs might provide testimonials like this:

 *We were always in the forest to find the rubber vines, to go without food, and our women had to give up cultivating the fields and gardens. Then we starved ... When we failed and our rubber was short, the soldiers came to our towns and killed us. Many were shot, some had their ears cut off; others were tied up with ropes round their necks and taken away.*

  The punishment for failure to meet quotes is set to death. And to prove that quotas are enforced the BBEG decrees that any shortfall in quotas must be made up for by a proportional number of hands of those executed. The party could encounter a small war between two villages where one is attacking the other to collect hands for payment.

Tyrilean,"Using r/personalfinance as a gauge of Americans is going to give you a serious skew.

First of all, the people who post asking for advice generally fall into two categories:

1. They've fallen so deep into debt that no amount of advice from armchair financial advisors is going to help them.
2. They are well off people who have an interest in gaming personal finance.

The latter group are generally those who are commenting. And you'll find that a sample group of people who spend their time on the internet discussing financial planning are generally slightly to the right hand side of the bell curve when it comes to money.

As someone who worked for years in a warehouse, and couldn't even afford to keep a bank account (the overdraft fees were unmanageable, so I just operated off of cash; when I was out, I was out), I understand all too well that there's no amount of budgeting that will help when you literally don't make enough money to survive. I managed to claw myself out, get a degree in CS, and now make well into the six figures. Suddenly, I've got spreadsheets and spend time on r/personalfinance. Funny how that works.

When you started playing the game, and I really felt so humbled and honored you shared your story, as I'm all about the share, you said you started with circa 50k and your mate had about 5k, and the medical dude had a butt load more. Paraphrasing here. Forgive inconsistent numbers. I see them as general abstractions. So, I started in October with same! 4k! I got as high as 97K. Now sit around 52K, but I try to peel off 500 cash everyday due to a plebe kitchen reno. That is a different side story-lord help us, involving Beachbody (FRX) and palm rats and ruination of electrical infrastructure. Nuff said. Fucking magical convergence if you ask me, lol. 

Nonetheless, I duly noted you had a finance vocabulary and 55K going in. I had ZERO finance vocab, and 4K in October. I lurked here, November to January and jumped in. High learning curve. WTF? Not just SPACS, but taxes, options, TAM, valuations, all in 6 months. Still working, learning. That is actually why i asked the mods how to stop followers. I am so new!

Directly addressing your point- YES. Marshall Plan! CRUX of it. --Gingko poised to implement it. Ya, they are manufacturing parachutes right now for Moderna, but will redeploy the tech in peacetime and the augmented efficacy of their platform in the meanwhile, is unassailable, if that makes sense. C'mon, what do you think that 1 Billion loan was for? AI, and CAP EX to print! Do you really think they will repay it, like any other company that got those covid loans? Nobody is repaying that shit if they were under 1 million. Fact. Maybe under 100K will be recalled, if I listen to the street. I don't think they will repay that loan. Pro Bono is a bad analogy, but then who knows? The 1 Billion investment to donate 25 Million services to Moderna, gosh, I have to think that is is going to print.

My feet have been on the ground in this sector for a long time. Started with 5 person teams from different disciplines asking how to fix mega toxic battery acid dump grounds like Super Fund sites in the 1990s. Now, Ginkgo has an app for for that. Apollonia! People are naive to think that there are not twenty teams lined up on five continents of young entrepreneurs waiting for Ginkgo to print their molecules. 500 in 2025 in a understated joke. How have they (Ginkgo) done this? They worked a decade ago to help form the free bio bricks and create the global competitions to seek out talent everywhere. They started, and coalesced as a group, by winning the i-Gem competition with their founder team. That was in the investor presentation. We as r/spacs recently donated 2k to i-gem! 

Yes, they will not only realize, globally, their potential, but it will be ethical and they will help recruit talent to America. Yet, they will also be printing overseas as a transnational. Their goal is to provide a dome of biosecurity on the entire planet. They see their work as eradicating all infectious disease and providing a security dome like that of Israel, for infection, globally, for every infection that exists. In this current historical moment, that is the only approach to biosecurity. Isn't it amazing to think that we will have an atmospheric dome around the planet free of infectious disease? Of course, it is the Marshall plan of American Biosecurity, but I don't think most everyday folks will mind, or comprehend it. 

The part that goes unspoken in this, is they only projected 50million as a one time line item for this year in their valuation. Think about that. There is no more in that number going forward as per SEC regs.  They are undersold, to be sure. The biosecurity will print, alone.",2021-07-06 02:04:47

SnooPickles8744,"I don’t have strict test prep advice, but I wanted to share my insights on / relate to some of the points you made. 

For context, I’ll be taking the LSAT for the first time in August. I don’t feel great about my score right now, so I think I’ll retest in October. 

I have a lot of anxiety and frustration about the test too. I also am a really good student. I have a 3.9 GPA and I’m finishing college in only three years while working and being in the honors program. I’m not saying that to brag or whatnot. I’m saying it to tell you that there are other people out here who are smart and capable and still cannot fully wrap their minds around this test. You are not dumb, not alone, and not lesser than.

I’m a finance major and I don’t know anyone else at my University taking this test, which is why I often reference this subreddit for advice and insight and things like that. However, I personally feel this subreddit can be hard to look at sometimes because it seems all the top scorers really stand out, which is great for them, but not realistic. There are very few posts like yours, even though I feel the majority of people feel the same way as you.

If it helps to have a new perspective on it, my sister took the MCAT last June. We were talking a few weeks ago about what the MCAT Reddit was like because I brought this LSAT Reddit up and discussed how everyone seems to be getting almost effortless perfect scores. She said she too often felt overwhelmed by the advice, scores, etc., shared on that MCAT Reddit. She felt she wasn’t “up there” with all of them, even after she got her final score back. This fall, she will be attending a top medical school in a major metropolitan area with a 3% acceptance rate. So, don’t compare yourself too much to the people on here. For starters, you never know what is true and false, and you also don’t know who the whole person is behind those scores. There are some things and traits you have that will make you a great attorney that a 180 perfect scorer will never have. For example, you can look up specific law school admissions reports and see hundreds of instances where a 170+ scorer was denied entry and a 165 or less walked in with a scholarship in hand. This is across the board at almost every single school. Of course a high score matters and a huge portion of admissions, but who you are also matters. You have a set combination of characteristics and strengths, outside of this test, that others will never have. Don’t count those out during this process. 

Coming into college, somehow I was able to get a huge increase on my ACT score and I thought the LSAT would be the same, but as you know, it’s not. It’s a completely different ball game. Unlike the ACT (or SAT), at least for me, this is something I’m experiencing alone, without my classmates to compare myself to. What is nice about a test like the ACT is it generally compares you to a huge amount of people you know and are in class with everyday. Assuming you’re a good student, for most of your life, you were probably towards the top 20% of those people, maybe not always by nature alone, but it was always possible to work towards that. At least that’s how I feel and I feel like we are at a similar academic level based on what you said. However, the LSAT compares you to some of the smartest kids in college. In that sense, hitting the top 20% is much more difficult. It sounds bad, but in a sense, having those kids on the ACT who I knew I would always run circles around, even in my sleep, somehow made me feel much better about the entire process and lessened my anxiety. Sometimes while practicing the LSAT, I feel I have become those kids. It can be hard not to have a huge group around you while doing this, where you see the low, middle, and high. Instead, this forum, mostly only offers the high range of test takers. But, you have to remember that the low and middle is still there.  

Also, what I can tell you is that even if you are sincerely the least competent person taking this, which I’m sure you are not, you are far ahead of most people, who will not take this test. Just attempting this test is something you should be proud of. We all have different lives. Some people are philosophy majors, or have other prior knowledge that can be practically applied to this test. The sole fact you make the time, have the diligence and character to study for this, take it, feel disappointed in yourself, and get back up again is commendable. Getting back up again —That is something many people can’t do after living their whole lives on this Earth.

I don’t have great advice for a gap year. From reading this forum, I know a lot of people push for a gap year if they don’t get their desired results at first. From a financial standpoint, I would try to avoid a gap year, especially if you are on your parents insurance and will be getting a full time job if you take a gap year. Sometimes you can fall off the insurance since you are working full time and once you get back to school full time it will be very difficult to get back on their insurance plan (I’m talking about mostly health insurance). Sometimes people take a gap year to save up for school though or if you’re not on your parents insurance, it could be more practical. But, graduating early and having one more year as full work as an attorney will be incredibly valuable. This is just a personal opinion, but I think a lot of people take a gap year in hopes of getting into a better school, but end up at the same school (or comparable) they would’ve gotten into anyways and now they have a wasted year under their belt. For me, the test deadline is good because it pressures you to get ready by X date and study hard. Taking a gap year to relax and study here and there will probably bring you the same results as just getting in and getting done, if that makes sense. But, only you know you, and again, everyone has a different situation. Some people have huge struggles that pop up that force them into taking a gap year, etc. If you feel a gap year would be most beneficial, then go for it. You just can’t cheat yourself and take a year to half ass it. Take the full year and really push it. Although, at the end of the day, it will be the same amount of work. However, if you do end up taking the year, again, everyone is different, don’t feel bad about doing what is best for you. 

Next time you feel frustrated, take a step back and remember that it’s a steep learning curve. It doesn’t mean you’re never gonna get there. 

At the end of the day, no matter what your final score is, what is meant for you and your future career as a lawyer, and even beyond that, will not pass you by. Put in the work and keep your head up. Things will inevitably work out if you just keep giving it your best. 

I hope you feel better and know you’re not alone in feeling like this. It’s a hard test but you are talented and bright and it doesn’t define you and cannot fully encapsulate who you are. It’s just a little roadblock and we’ll get over it eventually if we just keep going.",2021-07-06 05:23:13

They go live every Monday and Tuesday night (approx 20-30 mins on Monday nights &amp; approx 60 mins on Tues). They cover the hot topic of the day for about 50% of the show, and spend the remaining 50% of the show answering questions that their followers e-mail them every week (you can message them your question about anything ASX, as long as you are subscribed... they have answered MANY of mine over the years). I love these guys - and it is SUCH a great resource tool to learn about the general market, picking stocks, reading trend lines, understanding fundamentals etc etc etc. The one thing to note is that they always talk about 'buy, hold, sell' signals etc, so they are definitely more traders, buying low, selling high - I am a buy and hold investor, so I have (close to) 0 intention to sell out of my listings for 5-10+ years. Keep this in mind when listening to them, as they are more active investors.

For allocating risk to your portfolio, I would simply ask you ""What would it take for you to sell your stock""? If you stock goes down 5% in a week, would you sell? 7% in a day? 10% in a week? 30% in a month? 

I am not in a stock that I don't whole-heartedly want to be behind. So if a share drops 30-40% in a month or two, i understand that it will bounce back, and I will stick it out. My girlfriend on the other hand is having heart-attacks on the few stocks i've recommended to her, because she's currently -15-20% on it (stocks currently in a market correction).

To keep things as simple as I can - If you don't want to lose sleep at night, and you want your wealth to accumulate over time (over time being the ABSOLUTE KEY - think 10-40 years, not 1-4), then my advice would honestly be as simple as picking 1 low, 1 medium and 1 high risk ETF, and put 33% in each.

If you like the approach above, but you LOVE one sector in particular (tech for me), then you could STILL diversify and spread your risk, and know that you'll be just fine. Example of this for a tech-lover could be:

NDQ - Top 100 Tech (US)

ASIA - Top Tech ASIA (exl. Japan)

ATEC - Top 100 Aussie Tech

That way, you are fully diversified globally across a sector you firmly believe to have attractive returns, you aren't relying on one market to do all the heavy lifting, you are a little more in the medium-risk / medium-reward territory, but you should see more generous returns, as they should outperform the market in the short / medium / long term.

Riskier than that? Pick 2-3 ETF's in sectors that you love (again for me it's tech, for you it may be something else...) to make up 50-70% of your portfolio, and use the remaining 30% to buy some individual stocks that you either have a good understanding of, or that you know currently have great buy opportunities and hold for the long term.

And if you do make a mistake, don't beat yourself up about it. That mistake SHOULD (if your fundamental plan that you put into place now) not punish you too hard, as it should only make up a relatively small part of your portfolio.

Sell the stock, take the loss on the chin as a learning curve, use the remaining money to re-invest wisely (if it is a smaller loss, feel free to re-invest into an individual stock, if it was a bigger loss... maybe that money is better invested into your ETF to avoid the mistake from happening again).

  
Hope there's some logic in here for you to digest :) 

Everyones journey is very individual, so I don't want to sway you to my way. It may be the complete wrong way to go, but it has worked for me, it has given me great returns, and I have thoroughly enjoyed my investing experience so far.

bandersnatching,"The author is a professional Conservative propagandist. His intention here is to ridicule and undermine the credibility of Carney, the Trudeau government, the LPC and Liberals in general. He does this for money, and Sunmedia are pleased to post whatever he and other Conservative political operators have to say. Not that they pay him; it serves as an advertorial to ensure he picks-up lucrative Conservative contracts in the coming election, and, in the unlikely event of Conservative victory, a plum post in the new government.

The target audience is the 30% Conservative base, who appreciate their fundamentally anti-intellectual sentiments being reinforced. That the author's description of Carney's credentials, and those of other Liberals, makes plain what comparative light-weights are the members of the Conservative opposition, doesn't bother them a bit, even if they noticed.  They don't appear to like their politicians to be smarter than they believe themselves to be.

The author paints Carney as a political neophyte, and therefore a fool to have such aspirations. This is of  course incorrect. After a successful career as a senior leader in the Finance Department, he moves to lead the Bank of Canada, and then the Bank of England. These are fundamentally political roles.

Whether he can immediately stand-up to the vitriolic attacks of Conservative politicians and propagandists, while staying on message, remains to seen. There will no doubt be a learning curve for him, as there is for all new MPs.

SwapApp,"&gt;So a 100$ TVL will increase aggregated TVL of the system by 200$

That's true, even more so with vaults accepting deposit tokens distributed by other vaults (curve -&gt; yearn -&gt; vault). The same is happening in conventional finance or even banking (fractional reserve).

&gt;Another mystery to me is why would a platform provide you yield/return when you stake an LP Token?

Exchanges &amp; lending venues offer rewards (liquidity farming) to incentivize liquidity providers (uniswap did this, sushiswap, pancakeswap and quickswap currently do it) as they depend on them.

Farms take advantage of that and resell these rewards to compound the LP of the depositor &amp; help them earn more rewards. In addition many farms issue their own tokens to incentivize depositors even further.",2021-07-06 23:54:30

ColdPorridge,"If maxing your pay potential is really what you’re after (and you have some willingness to relocate), I think pursuing roles at FAANG or NYC finance could be an appropriate career strategy. I would take it in phases though. 

First, try to get that jump from your current salary. If you’re in the US, you’re currently underpaid, and you can certainly get a 50-100% raise no problem at any number of places. If you want to build good skills and use the latest tools, shoot for tech companies. The (former) unicorns (AirBnB, Uber, Lyft, Square, Affirm, Robinhood, etc) are great places to learn the latest best practices, and have excellent compensation (often as good or better than FAANG). These can be as competitive as FAANG to get into, but also some can be less so, depending on the role.

If you’re unable to land something FAANG or a unicorn, I would focus on old tech (Adobe, Oracle, Cisco, etc). They can definitely be behind the curve on modernity, but some teams are cutting edge, and in general they will have more modern practices than large non-tech companies. Other good options are smaller startups, but these can be a total shit show, and in general are high stress but can be good environments to grow in if you’re fine with startup culture (i.e. bro culture).

In general, when looking for jobs, you’ll want to have an honest back and forth with the hiring manager about your skills (both your value add and what you don’t have experience with) and what they’re looking for. You don’t need to have experience with every tech to be hired into a role using it, so don’t stress to much about what you don’t know. 

Also I find it more useful to spear fish for jobs than cast a net. LinkedIn is your friend, and a tried and true method is leveraging your personal network for referrals, and in the absence of this, cold messaging people at your target company (advice here would be to not come off desperate or directly ask about roles in the first message, play it cool cucumber). Target a smaller number of jobs and try to get in via recruiter/referral. In general, if you’re applying to a job before you’ve spoken to someone internally about that specific role, you are doing it wrong (or at least inefficiently).",2021-07-07 20:45:49

Joseph20102011,"1.) Filipino English language teachers are only good at speaking the language in a bookish way that many of them couldn't even hold casual day-to-day conversations with native English language speakers from white Anglophone countries. Much of the English language expressions written in textbooks are not even spoken by native speakers, thus the English language proficiency of most Filipinos cannot achieve a near-native fluency level at a minimum because we rely on obsolete textbooks on how to speak English.

2.) Mandarin has a notoriously higher steeping learning curve that it basically impossible to achieve conversational-level fluency level unless one moves out of the country and live in China, so let's give other foreign language options like Spanish to students who don't like to undergo grueling rote memorization-driven language acquisition that Mandarin demands.

3.) No more further explanation.

4.) It is time to streamline government budgetary priorities that it has to reduce its interference to sectors that the private sector can efficiently do more than the government like education because the public school system is a mess as it relies on public funding through taxes that is too susceptible to corruption by unscrupulous education bureaucrats. Better for the government to abdicate a bit some responsibilities on the public school system like allowing private individuals or corporations to finance public elementary or secondary schools from their own pockets, instead of relying on taxpayers' money.

5.) Generalist teachers (BSED graduates) still dominate in public secondary schools who some of them also teach subjects that are not related to their education baccalaureate degree they finished (out-of-field teaching).",2021-07-09 09:25:08
heyheoy,"Yesterday i remember reading in one Discord that the apy displayed by StakeDAO for example was inaccurate, they stated it was near 30% but in the end it was more like 15%.

I use other platforms like Alpha Finance and Autofarm and doing my months the APY they show are accurate. (Before i tried AAVE, Curve and others and i can say the same).

Problem is that APYs change every minute, depending the platform, if they are lending/borrowing platforms they will change every minute. I think that for LP it will be the same, the only that doesnt change that much constantly are native tokens in single token vaults.

If you are going to do staking for long, you shouldnt do numbers for example i stake $1000 today at a 30% rate, 9 of July 2022 i will end up with $1300, since it wont happen. You can watch the Apy for 1 month, take note on the numbers and do a Minimum and Maximum APY values for something more accurate.",2021-07-09 12:20:32

Extraportion,"Cheers SCfan. As I said elsewhere, we have around 1GW of contracted PV capacity and, as you can probably imagine, we forecast seasonal, 14 day, 7 day and day ahead delivery pretty extensively. You are absolutely right that even on commercial scales with decent geographic distribution you can have days with very little export. 

Again, I think you’ve nailed it with the overcapacity point. People don’t seem to understand that as you cannot (easily) store power it is much more impacted than supply and demand than other commodities. When you have an oversupply of one particular technology the capacity factors drop to basically zero. E.g. you are curtailing so much that you’re almost never exporting. When you do export the price you will achieve in the market will be negligible. You can actually see this happening already in California with what is affectionately known as “the duck curve”, because the intraday price curve looks a bit like a duck. Prices fall in the middle of the day and then pick up around the shoulder periods (when the sun rises and sets). 

Just_one_last_thing is right that the LCOE is outrageously low on PV, but it still has to achieve some margin to make the investment case worthwhile. If the capacity factor is &lt;1% then you’re not going to be exporting enough to recoup your investment and you won’t secure finance.",2021-07-10 09:01:58

MinimalGravitas,"I see people recommending the Nexo, Blockfi, Celsius here all the time, but few people explain the risk of using these centralized platforms. You need to trust them with your coins and tokens but they don't have the same level of regulation and safeguards that you would get at a traditional bank. The advantage over banks is that they can offer higher interest by operating with crypto currencies and it is fair to point out that they have one advantage over DeFi platforms in that they are simple to use and don't require any investment of learning or responsibility for private keys and ownership of wallets on the part of the user... however all you're really doing is giving money to an unknown person and trusting them to make you money, conceptually it's no different to using the legacy financial world, which presumably most people who got interested in crypto are trying to avoid.

DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance, it means you are not giving your coins and tokens to a company but rather you interact with smart contracts and dApps which run on a blockchain. This means that everything is transparent (you can look at the blockchain and the code that's being run to validate it). The disadvantage is that you have to take responsibility for your own investments, you have to learn how they work and control your own wallets and keys. An example of a DeFi platform would be Curve: https://curve.fi/ which as you can see is not so user friendly and doesn't have an expensive corporate website, but you are able to review the code that controls your finances (https://github.com/curvefi/) and can check the maths to understand exactly how it works (https://curve.fi/files/stableswap-paper.pdf). This is a completely different way to make money with your money, which avoids having to trust someone to do it for you. It's still risky, because if you fail to understand something before investing then the protocol can fail, you might get 'rug pulled' or you might lose your keys... however at least you have a fair opportunity to avoid the risks, rather than just picking a random company to 

A comparison might be between using taxis and learning to drive. You can call a taxi every time you want to get somewhere, but you are trusting the driver to be well intentioned and competent. Or you can learn to drive yourself, which is probably more dangerous for the first few times as you figure out how the process works, but ultimately you'll end up better off and can feel secure that you are the person responsible for your own journeys.

I think that what's going on here, whatever the claims made by the companies about security, is that they don't want to get ahead of the curve in adapting to a new technological environment which might upset the above political-economic arrangement. Certainly not for the sake of the mere convenience of a few interchangeable employees.",2021-07-11 19:09:10

KingZiptie,"&gt; In competitive, or potentially competitive, peer polity situations the option to collapse to a lower level of complexity is an invitation to be dominated by some other member of the cluster. To the extent that such domination is to be avoided, invest­ment in organizational complexity must be maintained at a level comparable to one's competitors, even if marginal returns become unfavorable. Complexity must be main­tained regardless of cost. -- Joseph Tainter, *The Collapse of Complex Societies*

Our infrastructure and general systems were built on high marginal returns on complexity, high levels of EROEI, and ultimately the ""loot"" America ended up with post-WW2 (hence bretton woods, etc).

As our system has gotten more and more complicated, marginal returns on complexity have declined. The only way (realistically) to address this problem is to increase energy subsidies... but our EROEI rates are actually declining instead. 

As a consequence the complex society must choose where to invest its EROEI abundance in terms of maintaining (or growing) complexity, engage in empire, etc. As America's windfall ran out and Europe began trading the dollar for gold, America closed the gold window, turned the USD fiat, and then Kissinger weaponized the dollar again by negotiating the rise of the petrodollar. Shortly thereafter Carter would start neoliberalism in motion (while timidly trying to avoid its necessity by using the Malaise speech), and Reagan would in turn deploy it in a full-blown fashion (as every US admin has ever since).

Neofeudalism/neoconservatism/neoliberalism is the empire's conquering mechanism. It spread and ruthlessly conquered Western and third world nations via corporate/finance/fancy-lad-institutional means, the petrodollar, and was protected from those who resisted by its ""muscle""... the US military and CIA. 

As diminishing marginal returns and falling EROEI continue to get worse, even that isn't enough. First, all empires go through ""Foucault's Boomerang"" if given the chance (not taken over by an external enemy first)- this is where the imperial mechanisms are turned inwards on the empire itself. Second, hypernormalization sets in where absurd destructive and ultimately unsustainable paradigms are maintained and accepted as normal. Finally as marginal returns on complexity and EROEI declines, the system must choose to *cannibalize* the parts it doesn't ""need"" in order to afford the parts that it does need. This is colloquially called the ""cannibalization of the peasantry/serf"" phase of empire. We are here now. Many mechanisms are used- neoliberal paywalls extract every cent they can, housing is turned into a means of slavery (too expensive to own- all renting), social stratification of goods intensifies, infrastructure declines in what Chris Hedges calls ""sacrifice zones"" (poor infrastructure decays while richie infrastructures are maintained or expanded), social safety nets are underfunded or non-existent, certain high value but low supply goods are rationed (e.g. US healthcare where poors are basically threatened with financial ruin for using it... while richies have the best insurances, plenty of money to burn, and thus always access to care), etc etc etc.

Even a sense of community- which the OP astutely notices as declining- is being cannibalized. The true horror of our modern process is that it is *disassociated* in terms of how it cannibalizes. Disassociative structures morally launder wealth as it moves upwards, and a Portfolio of Rationalizations (neoliberal/neoconservative dogma, modern economics, etc) exists to absolve any richie beneficiary of this process. 

The world is *abstracted* to the richies via these disassociative structures, and thus they see only numbers and metrics etc that tell them a story completely disconnected from what we see and feel. 

This process is something we can innately *feel* happening *in the form of paywalls being erected in front of every social interaction.* As everything becomes too expensive we can afford only the means to survive and the *appearance* of ""everything is fine"" (home, car, etc etc). Just as the nation's government is a thin visage of bullshit which pretends to value liberty, justice, democracy, etc but which does none of those things, so too do we ""pretend"" because we cannot afford to ""really do""- case in point: excessive video gaming (which I've done plenty of so im not being snobby here). This all sounds familiar doesn't it? *Hypernormalization* again: believing in fiction, and normalizing absurd fictions as reality. 

Many people can only *pretend* to care, and thus no real investment towards social structures which support community is made. 

We really have one of a few options: 1) continue along the curve of decreasing marginal returns on complexity until fracture/war resorts the order or millions/billions die, 2) find new energy subsidies sufficient to continue generating complexity (a higher EROEI than fossil fuels... good luck) while also using this energy to scrub CO2 and export toxicity (hahahaha good luck again), 3) embrace a system which uses significantly less resources, abandons the maintenance of unnecessary complexity (thus increasing marginal returns on complexity), and balances power moreso between the rich and the poor (the rich will burn the world down to avoid this), or 4) realize we are fucked.",2021-07-12 03:58:22
PWNWTFBBQ,"I completely understand your point. Many people have said the same thing about hesitancy to accept what I wrote as truth. I like the saying, ""2 data points make a line but 3 makes a trend."" It is also using this thinking as to why I did a within population comparison. While there are 2 populations of curves, there are a shit ton of candlesticks within each curve.

The 90 day timeframe currently is speculative because we need a 3rd series to determine its accuracy. However, for the two populations of curves, within them their candlesticks show almost the same day to day behavior. The probability of each day have the same behavior in some invisible trend to happen randomly is so fucking low.

Since this has been such a common response made in my previous posts, I'm going to stress the craziness of the candlestick and hopefully calculate the probability of something like this ever occurring. The 90 day time frame was merely an observation that I was hoping a finance person would chime in to explain why that was occurring.

Grocery, development in neglected east OKC getting widespread attention with documentary, and a book.
PAIGE DILLARD, OKLAHOMAN
In the middle of the east side of Oklahoma City, along the main street of the local African American community, a success story is rising against all odds and is attracting national attention as a possible model for overcoming decades of discrimination and systemic racism. 


It took a few years to get built, but EastPoint at NE 23 and Rhode Island is complete and home to a dream list of tenants for any neglected neighborhood.  

The project started with redevelopment of a boarded-up former truck stop and a decision by Centennial Health, formerly known as Oklahoma City Clinic, to anchor EastPoint with its headquarters and healthcare center. Next door, area residents are enjoying a non-profit grocery operated by Homeland and featuring fresh produce from a nearby farm operated by Restore OKC.

The EastPoint development at the 1700 block of NE 23 St. is a success story drawing national attention.
CHRIS LANDSBERGER/THE OKLAHOMAN
The second phase of development tackled a worn-down retail strip across the street from the clinic and grocery. The transformed center is now home to a fitness center, bar, bookstore, optometrist and offices with a pizzeria and coffee shop to open soon. 

And in a unique twist aimed at preventing outside gentrification, the Black-owned businesses opening in the retail strip are each offered an opportunity to include an equity stake in the building as part of their leases. 

A national panel of judges with the Urban Land Institute toured the development in June. A documentary about EastPoint created by Stout Media and the project’s architects at Gardner Studio won the grand prize from the American Institute of Architects’ annual national film challenge. 

Seth Levine and Elizabeth MacBride also made the trek to NE 23 as they researched their book “The New Builders: Face to Face with the TRUE Future of Business.” The authors say EastPoint was one of their first focuses as they sought to chronicle the diversity of minority entrepreneurs starting businesses at a rate that outpaces any other entrepreneurial group in the country.

“EastPoint is quite innovative,” Levine said. “It solves problems of outside developers coming into neighborhoods who are well-intentioned but end up building projects that force residents out of their neighborhoods.” 

MacBride said they were intrigued at the array of challenges overcome by the EastPoint team, starting with the legacy of discriminatory investment and lending for both developers and business owners like Emmanuel Sosanya, who now operates a fitness gym there.

“There is a ton of big money in the world to help communities like on the east side, but not a lot of people who can figure out how to put that together,” MacBride said. “How do you fund a fitness gym in EastPoint? What he needs is a form of finance that helps him build wealth in his company. But what he needs is $5,000 to $12,000. There are banks that want to loan millions, but not at the amount he needs.”

Faded community 
Sandino Thompson grew up in northeast Oklahoma City. His parents, Wayne and Melba Thompson, were civic leaders on the east side with a long list of efforts to improve healthcare and improve prospects for Black youth. His grandmother, Daisy Mitchell, helped establish the Mary Mahoney Center. 

“My grandmother’s house is around the corner,” Thompson said. “I grew up spending time here during the summers, so I’m very familiar with 23rd Street.” 

The area faded over time, he said. 

“When we were growing up, I’d be here in the summer and I’d walk on 23rd Street to go to the stores, walk to the grocery and different businesses,” Thompson said. “By the time I was in high school this wasn’t a place where you would walk anywhere on 23rd. It wasn’t that place anymore.” 

But hope endured. Thompson grew up in a family of activists, his parents always pushing for change and improvement. He was familiar with the starts and stops to rekindle the community and bring back economic development.

BRYAN TERRY/THE OKLAHOMAN
A lot of the discussions took place at the Ralph Ellison Library at NE 23 and Martin Luther King Avenue. 

“Whenever there were events like that, how we could get things going and see revitalization in this part of town, they would be held at the library,” Thompson said. “There are a lot of people I knew who owned property that fell into disrepair. They didn’t know what to do with it, and often they didn’t have the means to follow through with the ideas they had.” 

Interstate 235 is the dividing line between east and west Oklahoma City. And while NE 23 was stagnating, a different story was taking place along NW 23 where similarly neglected commercial buildings were coming back to life with restaurants, bars and entertainment venues. 

The Pivot Project, a group started by David Wanzer, Jonathan Dodson and Ben Sellers (who has since left the partnership), was building a track record of successfully redeveloping older properties, including the iconic Tower Theatre and an adjoining strip of abandoned storefronts. 

Thompson got to know Dodson, a former banker, as the pair served on the Bricktown Design Review Committee. The pair started talking about dreams of bringing similar development to NE 23. The Oklahoma City Clinic was looking to leave its long-time home at the Oklahoma Health Center and rebrand itself as Centennial Health Clinic. 

Thompson, joining with the Pivot Project, did a deal with Centennial Health to move its headquarters and operate its clinic in the former Cleary’s Service Station at 1720 NE 23. 

“The assumption was if we have the capital, a development group that has an inclusive approach to development, and we have local community partners and leaders involved, this should be pretty easy,” Thompson said. “We have an anchor tenant; we know what this looks like and we know what we’re facing.”

Overcoming history 
The development team hoped they had all the ingredients to attract financing. They had the support of the mayor and council and were in communication with community leaders. Two dozen banks declined to finance EastPoint. 

“We would tell them the location, and they would say, ‘Oh, well, we really haven’t loaned money on that side of town,’ ‘We haven’t really done things on that side of town,’ ‘We don’t have comps,’ ‘We’re not sure about appraisals.'” 

After decades of redlining and flight of capital, how could the east side provide comps, which help banks track property values and lending patterns? These bankers weren’t necessarily racist, Thompson said, but he believes it all comes back to the systemic racism that plagues Black communities throughout the country. 

“Despite having the guys who brought the Tower Theatre back, the guys celebrated around town for pulling off some tricky developments, challenging developments that they made work and have success, to have them at the table, and the full-on support of our council person, and community leaders, we couldn’t get financing,” Thompson said. “We couldn’t get a bank to spend a lot of time with us.” 

White flight hit the east side in the 1950s and 1960s as the African American community battled for civil rights and an end to Jim Crow. The GI Bill and federal housing programs started after World War II were not equitably applied, Thompson said. 

“Sometimes the laws were explicitly meant to discourage Black homeownership and particularly in primarily white communities,” Thompson said. “As some of that began to change, you had white flight to the suburbs and this became a community and corridor for the African American community.” 

The city quit investing in the east side; streets and sidewalks crumbled and neighborhoods were not protected from encroaching industrial properties. Black families invested in the community began to see diminishing returns, Thompson said. 

The community lost voices to advocate for its well-being. ",2021-07-12 17:22:07

norcaltraveler,"Every class is subjected to the Haas Curve so there are no GPA boosters at Haas. Especially not among the core classes which are curved to a 3.4 (electives are curved to a 3.6). 

I'd say this really depends on your background and what you think your strengths are. If you have a good background in economics then UGBA 101A or B would be a good idea. Both are significantly less quantitative than their counterparts in the Econ department (Econ 100A/B) and I found UGBA 101B to be a breeze compared to Econ 100A. If you have some prior knowledge in accounting or finance then UGBA 102A or UGBA 103, respectively. Especially if you're decently good at math, UGBA 103 would be a good choice since that's really the only quantitative Haas class that uses anything beyond arithmetic. I took UGBA 104 with Andy Shogan and found it to be pretty clear and fair in terms of material and grading. If you've worked with Excel and/or have some basic knowledge of data science it would be a good choice. My highest core course grade was in UGBA 105 with Dana Carney. The midterm and final were all multiple choice, so if you're good at memorizing concepts/definitions then this would be a good course for you to take. UGBA 100 and 106 vary wildly based on the professor but generally involve quite a bit of public speaking so if you're good at presentations and don't mind group work then consider those. UGBA 107 is taught by Alan Ross every semester unless something has changed. Much of your grade is based on a semester-long research paper which, in my opinion, had very unclear and inconsistent grading. So I would personally avoid 107 your first semester. 

I wish I could give you a more concrete answer but I really think this depends on you and your background. But hopefully this helps and let me know if I can provide any more info! And congrats on getting into Haas :)",2021-07-14 04:27:56

You should have interest, make sure you land in a reputed institute. Even if that's not the case, make sure you have motivation for 4 years. Having spent considerable time in some of the premium institutes in Europe, most of the NPTEL material is on par with current industry trends. Even if you are in a shitty institute, this might help in your learning curve.   


People who studied Engg, give it up and move to other sector: Either they don't have interest  towards it or they failed to develop interest in their studying phase.

cheesetouchbobby,"Ok, I will fall off of the wage gap thought experiment and attempt to give you one that is a bit more neutral and not solely relying on progressive talking points. And I will also try to explain further what I mean by “it’s part”, and attempt to be neutral there also, so you don't necessarily have to rely or heavy dwell on progressive solutions to answer.   
Let's say there's a public school that takes an annual field trip to the zoo. And at the end of the day the kids take a pop quiz about the animals they saw that goes towards their biology grade and the trip itself costs $40 dollars to go. Now there's an one important problem that may arise within the grade system for students that couldn't go due their parents not having extra income to pay for it. This could lead to a grade disparity between students living in lower income households vs  higher income households.  
 Now should the school do “its part” in adjusting the variables surrounding field trips in order to close this gap in grading disparity or should they disregard these efforts on the basis that some kids don’t have the opportunities like education? “Its part” put simply, could be a wide array of solutions with different types of combination but with their goals being to minimize this disparity in grades in relation to field trips. A few of the solutions being, changing when the field trip is held so that it is outside the grading period, remove the pop quiz or grading curve associated with said quiz, or implementing solutions that may help finance poorer students or all students so that income is less of a factor, like a annual bake sale :). Should the school do “its part” in adjusting or removing the system in the pursuit of fairness or should it not on, the basis that other kids do not have access to school?",2021-07-15 04:08:01

Malokium,"I saw your comment on GT about feeling bad that you aren’t landing anything and yet you here younger guys in the library talking about their $45/hr internships. I have a 2.6 GPA and had a 10% hit rate (which is huge) on converting cold-email resume sends to one of those $45/hr finance internships. If you said you’ve sent out 250 applications and aren’t receiving anything back are these just random applications on LinkedIn you quick fill out and send the same resume over to all of them? If so I can see why you aren’t hitting as hard as you could. Your resume shows great experience in an engineering field with some solid skills AND your business experience shows you’re an ambitious self starter willing to take risks to start a business. You have the skills but I think you’re missing some key things:

Delete your other school and keep GT only. You’re super old you said you’re a 4th year but graduating in 2023. Take off 2020-2023 and put class of 2023. You don’t want these companies already assuming the reason you’re taking longer is because of indecision in your major or not succeeding in academic prereqs. Next change skills to skills and interests and put some of your interests that make you stand out and you can form personable connections with your interview. I had cooking as one of mine and 5 minutes that could’ve been used to ask about yield curve convexity and options theory turned into 5 minutes of discussing my favorite cuisine and food recommendations I had for atlanta. Not only did I make a personal connection that made my interview stick out, but I didn’t get asked an additional amount of technicals that could’ve shown weakness (granted anything I got asked I hit out of the park so maybe they just assumed I knew everything and wanted to talk about my cooking). Lastly, the way you should now approach jobs instead of shotgunning you’re resume to 250 companies applying online, go to LinkedIn and start looking for recruiters and their emails and send over an email (Theres templates online for cold emailing resume drops) and if you get a response apply online, or maybe you’ll be lucky and they’ll forward your resume over.

Tldr: be more interesting, take off your second school and turn GT into class of 2023 (this is probably the biggest, approach your recruiting season differently. If you’re filling out 250 applications you’re putting in a ton of time just redoing things, how about fill out 20 applications in which for each of them you: Reach out prior to applying to one of the recruiters or current employees via email (use one of those apps where you can find employee email on LinkedIn), tailor your resume to the position (if you’re applying for a start up emphasize your own business start up and risk management you took challenges you overcame etc - do this in a cover letter or part of the cold email), and assuming you do all this and can finally get interviews im hopeful that you understand interviews are about technichals sure but mainly about making an impact and being memorable - which is why you need interests or club involvement.",2021-07-15 07:13:32

“To align with the ethos of decentralized finance, [we have] begun dissolving our corporate structure, evolving into a community-owned and governed crypto platform,” ShapeShift wrote in a statement.

ShapeShift claims that its airdrop is the largest in history, as FOX tokens will be dropped to more than one million addresses. 60% of the token supply has been allocated to ShapeShift users.

##

Additional tokens have been allocated to users of other DeFi platforms, including those who hold tokens for Gitcoin, Uniswap, SushiSwap, Yearn, Aave, Alchemix, 1inch, Curve, Balancer, and 0x. KeepKey wallet users are also eligible for the airdrop.

Crypto investors can connect their wallet on this web page (https://fox.shapeshift.com/airdrop) to find out if they are eligible for ShapeShift’s airdrop.

Trying to save up 5 mil before I do a big purchase of a faerie xwee morphing potion or desert Aisha morphing potion (not sure which I want first!)

For anyone curious how I did it:

Battledome: I mostly fought chia clown until about a week ago when I finally had trained my BD pet enough to beat jetsam ace everytime. Chia clown dropped lots of codestones for me and the occasional chocolate ice cream. Jetsam ace has been dropping the occasional nerkmid and a good amount of codestones. For a while I was saving the tan codestones for training and selling everything else, but now that I can 1 shot the ace I am selling everything of value. I keep the food that I get from the battledome to feed my pets instead of using the neolodge, and donate any junk items.

Faerieland employment agency: I only take jobs that are a base reward of 5000np+, and only if the price difference bt completing the job and the reward is at least 1000np. Some days I make 10k, some days 20k. It all depends on what jobs are available. Last night I had a single job net me 8k, some days the only jobs I find worth while will only net 2k.

Stonks: I have only cashed out on one stock, with 2000 shares bought at 15 and sold at 60. That got me 90k profit. I have 450k invested in the stock market, and intend to only cash out at 60 for each stock. It takes a while, but in the long term it always pays off.

Restocking: I do occasional restocking, mostly at the food shop or the smoothie store. Sometimes I will do the neopian central petpet store or the clothing shop. In general my advice is always search on SW (or SSW if you have it) to see if you can get a good profit before buying. Faerie quest items sell quickly. Get familiar with what sells for a profit and sells within a decent timeframe in any shop you decide to restock. This takes some time.

Food club: I only recently started playing food club. I have played 5 times and on my betting page it says I have made a profit of 125k so far. I follow the food club bets threads in the sub and choose one of the talented bettors suggestions each day. I was playing only 2000np on each bet, but since my last few plays were quite successful I raised it to 4000np.

Dailies: I do a good amount of the dailies on jellyneo's dailies. Trudy's is an absolute must, as is forgotten shore and the Magical blue grundo plushie. Those three dailies have given me the most return out of any of them. Obviously do the other free ones because it costs you nothing but if you only have time for a handful a day I'd say don't miss the aforementioned three. Especially Trudy's!!

And that's about it !!

I will say that I probably would already be to 3 mil by now if I hadn't spent 450k on an origami pb to use my premium perk for my alien Aisha. I impulsively did that when I only had 550k in the bank even after telling myself that I'd wait til 1 mil. An alien Aisha has been one of my top dreamies ever since I was a kid though so I couldn't resist!!

 I would not recommend this route though. Definitely smarter to follow the ""don't buy 1 of it until you could buy 3 of it"" rule of finance. Of course I understand if the impulse gets the better of you, but it's much easier to make more money when you have more money.

Also: the only other things I have bought were some inexpensive petpets for my pets (petpets were bt 1k-20k) battledome gear for my BD pet and Dubloons/codestones for training. Every other NP has gone into the bank, stonks, restocking, food club or the occasional wheel of excitement spin.

brooklynlad,"**Artículo Periodístico de Bloomberg (Parte 1 de 3):**

Every weekday morning, Mexico’s president holds a rambling televised celebration of his supposed successes: a news conference with special guests, video clips, and slick graphics that often has the air of a variety show. Until mid-January one of the favored features was a giant graphic that showcased Mexico’s undisputed progress as the first Latin American nation to vaccinate its citizens against Covid-19. Then the data turned bad. Pfizer Inc., at the time Mexico’s only supplier of Covid shots, halved, then completely stopped, deliveries. Vaccinations remained unchanged for almost a month; deaths surged. The vaccine tracker got yanked from the show.

Mexican viewers didn’t know it from watching President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s daily discourse, but Mexico was becoming one of the world’s deadliest Covid hot spots. The government’s alternate version of reality included an undercounting of cases and deaths, something it belatedly acknowledged in March when it announced that Covid-related deaths were far higher than the official count, which stood at about 234,000 as of July 5. More expansive estimates can be derived from excess deaths, the epidemiological term for increased mortality compared with an average year. In one such analysis, the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics &amp; Evaluation places Mexico’s Covid deaths at about 540,000.

During his morning broadcast on Jan. 18, López Obrador swerved around an uncomfortable truth: Pfizer had just shunted Mexico to the back of the line for limited supplies while it closed a plant in Belgium for upgrades. He spun a different tale: that he was altruistically acceding to a (nonexistent) request by the United Nations to give up shots so Pfizer could boost production to supply poorer nations “that don’t have the economic possibility to buy vaccines.” AMLO, as the president is known, claimed that he approved the Pfizer cut because “it would be unjust and inhumane and contradictory” not to. “We have to walk together, be supportive,” he said. On his YouTube channel, the news conference was titled “Redistribution of Covid-19 vaccines is an act of solidarity.”

What was actually happening was entirely out of Mexico’s hands. Yes, Pfizer’s retooling of its Belgian factory would eventually lead to greater global supply. But in the short term, the company made decisions about where it would send its vials and where it wouldn’t. It chose to make cuts in Latin America and Europe while sending millions of shots to Israel. The difference was that Israel had just signed a data-sharing deal with Pfizer, which would flood the country with its vaccine to test its real-world effectiveness—good for science and, of course, Pfizer.

The methods of estimating Covid’s true death toll vary, but study after study show Mexico among the world’s hardest-hit countries. For average monthly excess deaths during the pandemic, Mexico is third, behind Ecuador and Peru, according to a Bloomberg analysis of figures collected by Our World in Data. (As of July 6, Mexico has about 54% more deaths on average than over the previous five years; Ecuador is at 67% and Peru at 136%.) In other published tallies, Mexico has ranked third or fourth in the world for total excess deaths. The president’s office and the health ministry didn’t respond to requests for comment about the government’s handling of the pandemic.

Last winter the carnage in Mexico City was palpable. Black smoke billowed around the clock from overwhelmed cemetery crematoriums. Funereal bottlenecks forced families to take the remains of their loved ones to other parts of the country for timely disposal. In hospitals the bodies were backlogged on gurneys and in autopsy rooms. It took until May for Mexico’s hospitalizations to drop to 13% of capacity, from 90% in January, and the positivity rate, once the world’s highest at roughly 50%, to fall to 17%.

“Many patients didn’t have a chance to even make it to a hospital or wound up in a hospital that wasn’t prepared,” says Francisco Moreno, head of internal medicine at Centro Médico ABC, one of Mexico’s most prestigious private medical institutions. “What I saw was a total collapse of the health system.”

And yet, to the world and even some Mexicans, it’s almost as if it never happened. If you didn’t know that an extraordinary number of people had perished only months ago, it would be easy to see just another sunny summer on the horizon, with bustling boulevards and packed beaches. Some of this collective amnesia is due in part to the actions AMLO never took: While Europe is publicly wrestling with how to reopen to foreign tourism, Mexico never closed air travel from any countries or required any testing or quarantines from visitors. But the forgetting doesn’t mean it didn’t happen—or can’t happen again, soon.Mexico’s first mistake, and probably its biggest, was its coronavirus testing plan. As part of its initial pandemic response in March 2020, AMLO’s government didn’t offer tests unless a patient had symptoms. The method’s power to obscure was the envy of then-U.S. President Donald Trump. “I want to do what Mexico does. They don’t give you a test till you get to the emergency room and you’re vomiting,” Trump groused to top aides last summer, the New York Times reported.

Mexico’s strategy, which has never officially changed, both failed to keep the virus’s spread in check and meant the country’s death toll escaped wide notice. When researchers tried to put together more accurate numbers, the government erected barriers. Some researchers had been able to cobble together a rough count of excess deaths in Mexico City based on death certificates, having noticed they were sequentially numbered. The idea was, if you know the latest number on the certificates, you know how many are dead. In March the authorities thwarted that workaround: The certificates were no longer searchable by number, only by name. There are no longer independently available statistics on excess mortality.

Mexico’s second big mistake was AMLO’s refusal to raise debt to pay for fiscal stimulus or aid to the poor, as the leaders of most major economies did. This reflected the economic quirks of the president himself, who’s never possessed a credit card in his name. The son of fabric shop owners from the state of Tabasco, AMLO has shunned luxuries and refused to fly on the presidential Boeing 787 Dreamliner—he’s been trying to sell it from his first day in office. His political philosophy was shaped by the disastrous debt default of 1982, which brought inflation to 115%, and the Tequila Crisis of 1994, which produced a sudden devaluation of the peso and a recession.

His government’s spending commitments for Covid relief amount to about 0.7% of gross domestic product—less than a third of the average for other developing countries in the Group of 20, the International Monetary Fund says. And those programs have largely been microloans to small businesses. While other countries essentially paid workers to stay home and supported companies so they could preserve jobs, Mexico’s policies had the effect of keeping people in circulation to earn a living.

Arturo Herrera, AMLO’s outgoing finance minister, argues that the administration saved Mexico from weakened public finances that would have had worse repercussions down the road, leading to cuts in social services. Had Mexico spent like Canada or Germany did on Covid stimulus, he said in a February interview with Bloomberg News, the additional debt would have exceeded all government funding for public universities and high schools. AMLO has also argued that his government inherited a broken hospital system and had to expand its capacity in a short time period to handle the health crisis, which is where it focused much of its attention, rather than on testing.

Throughout the first wave, in the spring and summer of 2020, Hugo López-Gatell, the nation’s virus czar, kept saying Mexico was beating back the outbreak, though it wasn’t. “The epidemic is slowing down,” he declared in a May 5, 2020, news conference. “We’ve flattened the curve.” When confronted with data showing the curve was in fact continuing to go up, he said what he really meant was the slope would have been steeper if it weren’t for the social distancing policies he’d implemented.

brooklynlad,"**Artículo Periodístico de Bloomberg (Parte 1 de 3):**

Every weekday morning, Mexico’s president holds a rambling televised celebration of his supposed successes: a news conference with special guests, video clips, and slick graphics that often has the air of a variety show. Until mid-January one of the favored features was a giant graphic that showcased Mexico’s undisputed progress as the first Latin American nation to vaccinate its citizens against Covid-19. Then the data turned bad. Pfizer Inc., at the time Mexico’s only supplier of Covid shots, halved, then completely stopped, deliveries. Vaccinations remained unchanged for almost a month; deaths surged. The vaccine tracker got yanked from the show.

Mexican viewers didn’t know it from watching President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s daily discourse, but Mexico was becoming one of the world’s deadliest Covid hot spots. The government’s alternate version of reality included an undercounting of cases and deaths, something it belatedly acknowledged in March when it announced that Covid-related deaths were far higher than the official count, which stood at about 234,000 as of July 5. More expansive estimates can be derived from excess deaths, the epidemiological term for increased mortality compared with an average year. In one such analysis, the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics &amp; Evaluation places Mexico’s Covid deaths at about 540,000.

During his morning broadcast on Jan. 18, López Obrador swerved around an uncomfortable truth: Pfizer had just shunted Mexico to the back of the line for limited supplies while it closed a plant in Belgium for upgrades. He spun a different tale: that he was altruistically acceding to a (nonexistent) request by the United Nations to give up shots so Pfizer could boost production to supply poorer nations “that don’t have the economic possibility to buy vaccines.” AMLO, as the president is known, claimed that he approved the Pfizer cut because “it would be unjust and inhumane and contradictory” not to. “We have to walk together, be supportive,” he said. On his YouTube channel, the news conference was titled “Redistribution of Covid-19 vaccines is an act of solidarity.”

What was actually happening was entirely out of Mexico’s hands. Yes, Pfizer’s retooling of its Belgian factory would eventually lead to greater global supply. But in the short term, the company made decisions about where it would send its vials and where it wouldn’t. It chose to make cuts in Latin America and Europe while sending millions of shots to Israel. The difference was that Israel had just signed a data-sharing deal with Pfizer, which would flood the country with its vaccine to test its real-world effectiveness—good for science and, of course, Pfizer.

The methods of estimating Covid’s true death toll vary, but study after study show Mexico among the world’s hardest-hit countries. For average monthly excess deaths during the pandemic, Mexico is third, behind Ecuador and Peru, according to a Bloomberg analysis of figures collected by Our World in Data. (As of July 6, Mexico has about 54% more deaths on average than over the previous five years; Ecuador is at 67% and Peru at 136%.) In other published tallies, Mexico has ranked third or fourth in the world for total excess deaths. The president’s office and the health ministry didn’t respond to requests for comment about the government’s handling of the pandemic.

Last winter the carnage in Mexico City was palpable. Black smoke billowed around the clock from overwhelmed cemetery crematoriums. Funereal bottlenecks forced families to take the remains of their loved ones to other parts of the country for timely disposal. In hospitals the bodies were backlogged on gurneys and in autopsy rooms. It took until May for Mexico’s hospitalizations to drop to 13% of capacity, from 90% in January, and the positivity rate, once the world’s highest at roughly 50%, to fall to 17%.

“Many patients didn’t have a chance to even make it to a hospital or wound up in a hospital that wasn’t prepared,” says Francisco Moreno, head of internal medicine at Centro Médico ABC, one of Mexico’s most prestigious private medical institutions. “What I saw was a total collapse of the health system.”

And yet, to the world and even some Mexicans, it’s almost as if it never happened. If you didn’t know that an extraordinary number of people had perished only months ago, it would be easy to see just another sunny summer on the horizon, with bustling boulevards and packed beaches. Some of this collective amnesia is due in part to the actions AMLO never took: While Europe is publicly wrestling with how to reopen to foreign tourism, Mexico never closed air travel from any countries or required any testing or quarantines from visitors. But the forgetting doesn’t mean it didn’t happen—or can’t happen again, soon.Mexico’s first mistake, and probably its biggest, was its coronavirus testing plan. As part of its initial pandemic response in March 2020, AMLO’s government didn’t offer tests unless a patient had symptoms. The method’s power to obscure was the envy of then-U.S. President Donald Trump. “I want to do what Mexico does. They don’t give you a test till you get to the emergency room and you’re vomiting,” Trump groused to top aides last summer, the New York Times reported.

Mexico’s strategy, which has never officially changed, both failed to keep the virus’s spread in check and meant the country’s death toll escaped wide notice. When researchers tried to put together more accurate numbers, the government erected barriers. Some researchers had been able to cobble together a rough count of excess deaths in Mexico City based on death certificates, having noticed they were sequentially numbered. The idea was, if you know the latest number on the certificates, you know how many are dead. In March the authorities thwarted that workaround: The certificates were no longer searchable by number, only by name. There are no longer independently available statistics on excess mortality.

Mexico’s second big mistake was AMLO’s refusal to raise debt to pay for fiscal stimulus or aid to the poor, as the leaders of most major economies did. This reflected the economic quirks of the president himself, who’s never possessed a credit card in his name. The son of fabric shop owners from the state of Tabasco, AMLO has shunned luxuries and refused to fly on the presidential Boeing 787 Dreamliner—he’s been trying to sell it from his first day in office. His political philosophy was shaped by the disastrous debt default of 1982, which brought inflation to 115%, and the Tequila Crisis of 1994, which produced a sudden devaluation of the peso and a recession.

His government’s spending commitments for Covid relief amount to about 0.7% of gross domestic product—less than a third of the average for other developing countries in the Group of 20, the International Monetary Fund says. And those programs have largely been microloans to small businesses. While other countries essentially paid workers to stay home and supported companies so they could preserve jobs, Mexico’s policies had the effect of keeping people in circulation to earn a living.

Arturo Herrera, AMLO’s outgoing finance minister, argues that the administration saved Mexico from weakened public finances that would have had worse repercussions down the road, leading to cuts in social services. Had Mexico spent like Canada or Germany did on Covid stimulus, he said in a February interview with Bloomberg News, the additional debt would have exceeded all government funding for public universities and high schools. AMLO has also argued that his government inherited a broken hospital system and had to expand its capacity in a short time period to handle the health crisis, which is where it focused much of its attention, rather than on testing.

Throughout the first wave, in the spring and summer of 2020, Hugo López-Gatell, the nation’s virus czar, kept saying Mexico was beating back the outbreak, though it wasn’t. “The epidemic is slowing down,” he declared in a May 5, 2020, news conference. “We’ve flattened the curve.” When confronted with data showing the curve was in fact continuing to go up, he said what he really meant was the slope would have been steeper if it weren’t for the social distancing policies he’d implemented. When a second wave of infections hit Mexico City toward the end of 2020, he and the mayor resisted ordering a shutdown, even as the city’s hospitals overflowed with patients. In January the government denied that the capital’s hospitals were full. Yet Bloomberg News found that paramedics had to drive their ambulances around through the night to find scarce unoccupied beds.

MaskUser_Aoi,"Great question, and I'm happy to chime in on this one as well.

Its value proposition is improving, but I'll start with what it does right now.

**Long-term community is weighted into the voting structure.** Similar to Curve Finance or a few other crypto projects, **the voting strength your $MASK tokens endow you with actually increases over time.** Specifics on this are not announced yet. Some are on the **Town Hall #1 reddit post**. It's sort of a ""Proof of Balance"" or ""Proof of Holding"" via multiple wallet balance Snapshots. We want a balance of large investors, long term community, and core team slowly handing the reigns over to the community for a robust governance structure.

**DAO Governance:** Voting on community proposals; 40% of $MASK supply is allocated to Foundation fund and the DAO community decides what happens to that money. So it's a lot of money to control in the future. Governance isn't unique but the token allocation is.

**Airdrop eligibility:** First airdrop was extremely generous-- 50 $MASK per holder when the token price was $20-$30 each, more for plugin users... up to 250 $MASK for some.

**ITO Participation**

**ITO Partnership Benefits:** O3 is doing an airdrop for participants. Other ITO projects are being encouraged to provide Mask community with yield farming, airdrops, discounts, etc. Depends on the project and their preferences.

**ITO Projects will be required to hold $MASK to launch** on our platform. This is also in the **Town Hall #1**.

Community proposals and core team ideas will bring more value to the token. It launched in February. It's July now. ;)

Two overviews of the token incl. allocations, vesting, MaskDAO.

saturnascend33,"YOu do not suffer IL in stable/stable pairs. Think of it like this. They make money two ways. You want DAI but have USDC. So you trade USDC for DAI and that little .xx% fee goes to the LP providers. Since Curve has the lowest slippage and a large TVL it is a good option (better than UNISWAP for example). 
Second if DAI is trading at 1.02 and someone has USDC which is at 1.00 in the 100k range. For arbitrage sake, they can swap USDC for DAI and instantly make 2% by swapping the DAI on a centralized or different exchange for a different token, all the while paying less than a percent in fees and hopefully when gwei is low. This can be a simple way of making under 2k instantly of course you have to have some serious $$$ to begin with.

If you have say 5k USDC making this small arbitrage play to DAI for 2% is not worth it. You are essentially working in a group to make your little money help someone make more money in return for a fraction of that money.

The real money with curve is learning https://resources.curve.fi/faq/vote-locking-boost#what-are-vecrv what vecrv is and how to lock in your crv to get the 2.5x curve boost (only available on layer 1).

People over look crv because it is so down down (97% from ath) but the thing is, if you check defi pulse it is practically as big as uniswap in terms of fees and volume, and yearn finance and convex both pretty much depend on curve.

A smart play would be earn as much crv as possible and bring it down to layer 1 to lock it in and earn as much as possible. 

I hate to say it but CRV and SUSHI are probably the two most over looked coins out there.  SNX is a serious play when they can really figure out layer 2.

The US is a funny country. We have so many financial regulators that we sometimes wind up without proper financial regulation. Cryptocurrencies represent the latest example.

The trade in bitcoin and its brethren has grown too big to be ignored — and yet that is what has happened. No official public data exist on prices, volume or volatility. No single authority regulates crypto exchanges. No one can be certain investors are being properly protected.

Even folks in the libertarian crypto world are wondering when the federal government will step in. Mike Novogratz, a fund manager who has helped lead the charge into the asset class, told CNBC there would be “relief” in the market once rules of the road were set and suggested Congress give the job to Gary Gensler, head of the Securities and Exchange Commission.“When Gary finally addresses it, it will be good,” Novogratz said of his fellow Goldman Sachs alumnus. “He would love to regulate all the crypto. He doesn’t have the mandate.”

It all amounts to a particularly American regulatory failure. Waiting for Gensler to get his hands on all the crypto has turned into the Wall Street equivalent of waiting for Godot.

The underlying difficulty is that US financial regulation is fragmented. There are multiple federal banking and market authorities, with overlapping jurisdictions, plus state regulatory systems. As Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, put it in his annual letter to shareholders: “There is no one real authority that can co-ordinate all the moving parts and bridge differences.”

In the long run, this is not entirely a bad thing. Checks and balances are as American as apple pie or junk bonds; having so many regulators serves as protection against any one of them messing up.

But this system has its weaknesses. New products that are neither fish nor fowl in a regulatory sense can fall through the cracks. Crypto is hard to regulate because it is hard to define. While true believers call cryptos currencies, US regulators view them differently. Bitcoin, for instance, has been deemed a commodity. Other cryptos are seen as securities.

This resulting confusion helps explain why neither the SEC nor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is directly regulating crypto exchanges such as Coinbase. No one has given them the job — a source of frustration for the regulators.

Congress, in its fashion, is on the case. Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator, wrote to Gensler this month to ask whether the SEC “has the proper authority to close existing gaps in regulation that leave investors and consumers vulnerable to dangers in this highly opaque and volatile market”.

Gensler’s response, due by July 28, will undoubtedly be persuasive. But whether it will prod legislators to act quickly is another matter. If history is any guide, Congress will wait for things to fall apart before deciding how they should have been put together in the first place.

The resulting impasse is exacerbating anxieties that regulators are falling further behind the curve. The crypto craze reminds many Wall Street veterans of the unregulated rise of credit default swaps in years leading to the financial crisis. Like crypto, CDS were hard to characterise, being a form of insurance that was not regulated as such, and were seen by their advocates as being too cool to be overseen by mere bureaucrats.

“It took a crisis to focus our attention on products like CDS,” said Sarah Hammer, managing director of the Stevens Center for Innovation in Finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “In some ways, crypto is more challenging than derivatives because it falls into many different regulatory laps.”

The irony for participants in the crypto markets is that they might be better off if a cop like Gensler was already on the beat. The various parties could get to know each other and reach some sort of an accommodation. It could even be a relief, as Novogratz said.

Now, the best way for regulators to get a handle on the crypto markets may be to come out swinging, using their general enforcement powers to set things straight. The SEC has already brought scores of crypto cases. Dan Berkovitz, CFTC commissioner, recently raised doubts about the legality of any derivatives deals taking place on decentralised finance, or “defi”, programs that use blockchain technology to cut out intermediaries.

It could get very interesting. I find myself reminded of that moment in the film All About Eve when Bette Davis turns to her guests and presents her forecast for the evening to come. “Fasten your seat belts,” she tells them, “it’s going to be a bumpy night.”",2021-07-18 14:42:29

Lots of bullish catalysts ahead —&gt; PLUG POWER is Leading the Charge Worldwide! 🌎

Very, very few companies have the large scaling growth potential of $PLUG.  And, I agree —&gt; It wouldn’t surprise me to start seeing more “double-digit” moves higher like the move up on January 7th when the $PLUG share price closed higher by 35.11%.  

The title of my Original Post here referenced the Gross Margin Expansion.  Investors have been waiting to hear this news for a long time!  NOW we see it happening!  Bullish!  This fundamental strengthening has not gone unnoticed by the investment community.  Note:  This was accomplished via the acquisition of GINER ELX using $PLUG shares as part of the payment.  Therefore, the FUD being pushed out about the shelving of additional shares is unfounded in my honest opinion.  Frankly, I want PLUG POWER to be “aggressive” to capture market share as fast as possible — and using the $PLUG shares wisely is part of the growth strategy —&gt; growth via acquisition.  Again, look at the “booming” Electrolyzer business — which is a result of the GINER ELX acquisition.  

My original investment thesis in 2013:  Invest heavily in $PLUG because it’s an Energy Company with large scaling growth potential in multiple markets spread out across multiple industries worldwide! 🌎 —&gt; I want to see “aggressive” growth.  

I remember CEO Andy Marsh saying back in 2013 on a Conference Call, and I will paraphrase:  “PLUG POWER will only enter into New Markets which have large scaling growth potential.” —&gt; Folks, I like CEO Andy Marsh’s “GO BIG“ mindset — which is why I have not sold 1 share — only added shares!  

At this time, PLUG POWER is financially stronger than it’s been since I first invested in 2013.  

And, the strategic growth initiatives including the Gigafactory &amp; LGH2 Plant Network will vertically integrate PLUG POWER —&gt; morphing this company into one of the Largest Energy Companies in the USA! 🇺🇸 ... The renewable energy cost curve (Cost inputs to generate LGH2 Fuel) is getting lower &amp; lower every year as more renewable energies come online.  Can you all imagine the exponential growth potential when Liquid Green Hydrogen Fuel is LOWER than the cost of diesel? —&gt; Huge Upside in $PLUG 📈

This is best for learning and if you have small kids that will steal your usb wallet ;)  Then if you want rETH or a return use curve.  Just search curve in the defi app on the wallet.  Hit pools ..click eth... Click the rETH pool...you can buy rETH or deposit your ETH into the pool.  Best done on a weekend or after-hours when gas is cheap.  Personally I just use trust wallet and lido finance for stETH.  Daily payout in through the smart contract in stETH. I believe it 5.6% APR atm.,2021-07-19 11:41:27

jmellyn,"Untrue. It's easy to get into law school (because there are too many of them) but law school IS hard. I say this as someone who has always been Type A. Gifted classes, best high schools and colleges, graduating with honors, everyone always expecting me to ace everything, assuming academics are ""easy"" for me, etc. 

Is the material extraordinarily hard? Not for most people. I've always said that the material we learn in law school is not difficult for anyone capable of doing reasonably well in undergrad. It is not engineering and it does NOT require engagement with the level of theory you are exposed to in some PhD programs (though you can certainly find that if you seek it out or are at the right school). It's not the material, it's the environment. Law school is hands down the most toxic academic environment I have ever been in. I have been in many challenging environments including other graduate degree programs. 

Compared to the vast majority of graduate/professional degree programs, law school is extremely intense. The amount of reading, learning a new form of writing, intense competition for grades because of the curve (recall that as difficult as it is - more difficult than law school because of how much they have to memorize - med school is usually pass/fail), jockeying for resume boosters and prestige markers like law review and clerkships is out of control (understandably, given how few law jobs there are that justify law school's price tag). Studying for law school finals during 1L was one of the most intense experiences of my life. My non-law school graduate degree exams do not compare. All so you have the pleasure of studying for the bar exam (an absolute nightmare experience).

Yes, there are people who successfully avoid the most toxic and intense parts and still manage to be successful - hats off to them, but I think most people have to make a choice between sanity and the type of success they envisioned when they started law school. I didn't have any visions of the type of success law students are competing for (big law, clerking, etc.) when I started and I still got sucked in. It's really hard not to.

This guy is supposedly a finance person? I took classes in business school. Yeah, economics is tough but overall, studying finance is not that intense and they've watered down those programs over the years. Anyone who thinks law school is especially easy hasn't been around enough other grad/professional programs. These days an undergrad degree is a high school diploma and a graduate degree is what an undergrad degree used to be. Many graduate degree programs are complete cake walks. Law school is not that.",2021-07-21 08:46:30
minimuminfeasibility,"I think I was unclear. For CS, UIUC is clearly better. For econ, Chicago is clearly better. For business at the undergrad level... it's unclear. If you do econ with the business econ focus at Chicago, the real strength is the econ courses -- because the business courses are totally plain. If you are doing CS and econ, I would say it depends on whether you stress the CS or the econ more.

However, if you really wanted to do CS and business (finance/accounting/marketing), you could probably get more out of UIUC because it has more than plain courses at an undergrad level and AP credits could let you reach the topics courses that are actually useful. Is the base of Chicago econ courses better than taking useful advanced topics classes in finance? Maybe not. It's not like you're going to be estimating a Cobb-Douglas production function at an asset manager, but you might be optimizing a fixed income portfolio to hedge curve risks.

Chicago sends more people into finance, but that's largely driven by MBA and graduate students.  Remember: Chicago has more grad students than undergrads.  Also, even incoming investment banking analysts now want to learn to code.",2021-07-21 14:11:06

SquizzOC,"So I'm going to offer some information on this just because I'm literally going through this process with our organization now.  

This is not as easy as ""I have 10 items and we need this"". Typically this is where you take the heads of each dept., get them on the phone with a few vendors of choice and allow them to ask any and all questions. There are things that finance does, you have no clue on, just like there are things the warehouse does, that you have no clue on and a short list like this just won't cut it. You can get a list, but you really need everyone to be engrained in the decision making process.  

It was a massive learning curve when I started the task for us (Outside my sales role, which is about 50% of what I do, I'm the PM and Administrator for our ERP, Salesforce, Lead Generation tools and ecommerce platform.)  

First, there are no cheap routes.  
Second, there are no cheap routes.  
Third, Netsuite and Salesforce are the best solutions I found out there.  



If you want your ERP to be integrated natively with Salesforce, Financial Force is the only way to go. However this isn't a best practice and usually isn't advised from everything I have been told or read, we are most likely going this route, but only because everything we do is built around Salesforce natively.  

Netsuite is our next runner up simply because they were a top tier product that we could either bring someone in internally to really manage/tweak/customize or have our choice of 100 different firms to do the work for us.  

Both of these solutions do the short list of requirements you have, but every basic ERP solution I took a look at did this as well. Odoo looked great at first, but we found that with the cost of customization and needing to check every little box for every little function, it wasn't as cheap as it appeared. Sage was another one that could have worked for us, but with the workflow abilities in Salesforce and us being a Sales organization primarily, FinancialForce is still looking like the clear winner. It's so easy to customize, that even I, a salesperson can do it. (After the heavy lifting is clearly done by the pro's lol).  

Good luck, these are the kinds of projects I drool over because I love creating processes to automate all the things, but it's exhausting :)",2021-07-22 06:33:23
kimchicabbage,Forget that and check out convex finance. It is built on top of curve. They allow you to earn curve rewards while still keeping your curve liquid. Locking directly with curve is better if you are a whale,2021-07-22 07:40:05
jtdolla911,"To answer your question, yes. If you lock CRV, you get rewarded in the form of Curve 3 pool tokens. These can then be staked into curve for yield plus a small amount of additional CRV tokens.

All of that requires a few gas fees and your rewards will depend on the size of the investment, as far as whether it's worth the gas or not.

There are other ways to utilize CRV tokens for locking.  You can lock them on Yearn Finance, StakeDao, or Convex Finance.  All offer varying strategies and I would recommend any and all of them. If you have enough to split your investment among them, it would be a great way to diversify exposure to Curve and their partners while mitigating risk and earning additional reward tokens.

If you are bullish on Curve and want to grow your stack, you could also deposit into the lending protocol Aave, which provides an interest rate about 12% currently. This would probably be a good short term play until the rates drop.",2021-07-22 09:57:57
VividAd399,"I'm no experienced pro, myself -- having started late, myself -- but I'd like to offer you my 2 cents...

My 1st attempt at trading was via M1 Finance, and I started in late February...

I lost my a$$ -- but I learned a few things...

But it wasn't until my 2nd attempt --  through a DIFFERENT brokerage -- that the mistakes I had made during my previous experience became more clear to me...

That 2nd brokerage is Webull, and IMHO there is NO COMPARISON...!!

I recommend you look on YouTube and check out some basic reviews and trading tutorials using Webull, simply to see what kind of depth of information it offers as a platform...

So, what did I learn...?

Well, through the data that Webull's charts provided, I learned that I jumped into my 1st trading experience at a very unfavorable point in the market when the VAST majority of stocks were at their peaks (which is why I lost my a$$)...

Anyhow, for what it's worth you're not alone in this... There is definitely a learning curve, at times it seems like everyone is a guru but you, and there are some good weeks and some bad ones...

But the most important thing is that you do your own research and make your own decisions, and being able to CONVENIENTLY have ready access to the DATA made ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD...!! 

I cannot overstate this...!!

So, IMHO you should do yourself a BIG favor and download the Webull App after you read this comment...

Remember: if there's anything in life that you WANT to make happen bad enough, you WILL latch onto it, you WILL learn the things that you need to know to become successful, and you WILL make whatever that thing is happen... 
  There are people much less intelligent than you who are doing whatever that thing is, and with a sincere approach, YOU can damn-sure do it, too (probably even better lol)...!!

Much Love and
Full Respect, 
~Jay Etatslla~



PS:  If you (or ANYONE ELSE who stumbles upon this comment, for that matter) appreciate my time spent tapping out this out -- and if decide to follow my advice -- I would surely appreciate it if you were to find my Facebook Account (Jay Etatslla) and click on 

**MY WEBULL REFERRAL LINK**...!!

Doing so will give YOU a couple free stocks...... AND it will ALSO give ME SOME FREE STOCKS, TOO...!! 😀

(Yes, this last part was shameless self-promotion, but I stand by everything else I said previously; I started this comment with only your interests in mind, but at the end it occurred to me that it'd be a pretty sweet side effect if I ended up benefitting, too...!! 😆) 



PSS:  Oh yeah.... In case you were curious how I've done with my 2nd trading attempt (after having switched to Webull)....
So far, I've put in ~$2,000.00 since late March, and I'm sitting at ~$3,180.ish...
Also, since this is what I chose to do with MY stimulus money, I've been trading the way I want to: MOSTLY high-volatility penny stocks (other people will strongly disagree with me, but it's MY CHOICE..... and so far it's paid off)...
I study my charts
 (1 week/1 month/3 months, but NOT counting anything before March), I pick a good (relatively low) entry point in a stock that has swung significantly above the current price AT LEAST TWICE in the past 3 months (at least 20% or higher), and I try my DAMNDEST not to sell out too low (with Webull you can even set a ""trailing stop"" sell order with a few cents gap, if you don't have time to watch the price).... 
Anyhow, this has gotten WAAAY too long, so.... Good luck, my friend...!!",2021-07-22 10:55:59
McKoijion,"Low pay? For years, Amazon literally paid double or more compared to other similar jobs. They were one of the first businesses to pay $15 an hour, and even that was a huge step down compared to the performance based stock compensation they paid out previously.

They are demanding, cutthroat, and fire the lowest performing workers with the same efficiency as a corporate law firm or investment bank. But that's the tradeoff. The most productive workers there made significantly more than they would have in any similar job, while the lowest performers were fired. 

This is a big reason why so many former workers are filled with grievances while the current employees vote against unionization. If you could do 60 units of work in 45 min, you could take a 15 min break. If you could only do 60 units of work in 60 minutes, you might try peeing in a bottle to keep up before you were ultimately let go.

Is this harsh? It depends on where you fit in. In most jobs, the best performing workers get paid the same as the lowest performing ones. There is less incentive to be good at your job. At the best paying jobs including medicine, law, finance, sports, acting, etc. the best performers make far more money while the lowest performers are fired. Amazon just applied this model to regular jobs too. And if it's unfair to fire a poor performer, it's even more unfair to retain that poor performer without even giving a chance to someone who might be better at that task. That's the person who most losses when there's corruption, nepotism, bureaucracy, etc. rather than a meritocracy. There's no unreasonable standard because you're graded on a curve that shifts according to how good the average person is at their job.",2021-07-22 12:36:16

PuffPuffFayeFaye,"I want to agree (and have said things like this myself) but the sad truth is that people don’t “learn” most of what they are “taught”.  We put people through thousands of hours of math that they don’t retain, literacy analysis that they don’t apply, science classes that they might enjoy in the moment but ultimately teach trivia rather than actual scientific principles.  People celebrate their ignorance and find comfort in their lack of agency.  Mandatory finance will be as beneficial as mandatory pool classes.  People who *want* to know and be better prepared than their peers will find a way or at least learn from their mistakes.

Not to be pessimistic but there will always be a bell curve and some people will always be in the wrong half of it.  

And, though I am a capitalist sycophant who is about to sound a bit like a socialist, all the financial literacy in the world won’t help the absurd policy-driven inflation in currency, education, and housing that essentially means that good financial literacy is “don’t even play the game”.

ViperThreat,"&gt;Not sure if you are a local business owner, I suspect not.

Your suspicions are partially incorrect. Technically my mother owns the business, but I've been taking more and more of a leadership role after discovering that she was paying nearly 48% in taxes last year. Even my mild understanding of finance and tax law was enough to drop that significantly, and it became clear that while she knew her operations inside and out, she needed somebody to step in with the higher level strategy stuff, which is basically me right now.

Most recently, I implemented a policy that gives all tenured employees a stake in the company on top of their standard wages and benefits. Sure my mother and I may lose money in the long run, but our employees are now fiercly loyal, and take much more pride in their work knowing that they get a piece of the pie when the business does well, and won't be out on their ass if/when we close the doors.  They don't see their job as a 9-5 anymore, and it was a huge stress reliever for many of our employees.  The company next to us just sold out and closed their doors, leaving about 20 employees with no income, and not even so much as a severance check.  Comparatively, our employees know that if such a thing happens in the future, they stand to make 5 or 6 digits on the deal.

&gt; For example, local construction and trade jobs have been aggressively hiring more unskilled labor than ever before due to shortages in skilled labor. These jobs pay more, and obviously reduces the number of folks available to do unskilled jobs in the food service industry like dishwashers, servers, and busing. 

I strongly disagree with this. I have many friends who work in the construction industry, including those who own their own businesses with numerous employees. They aren't replacing skilled laborers with unskilled laborers (legit, they can't - they have laws and standards that require professionals - they can't for example hire some highschool kid off the street to wire or plumb a 6 bedroom home), and their margins aren't much better than my own. Beyond that, the idea that any sort of labor is ""unskilled"" is a bit of a myth.  Working on a construction site requires quite a bit of knowledge on OSHA safety, not to mention an understanding of tools, materials, and basic construction practices. The same can be said for most all other careers, including the food services industry. There's always a learning curve, and what they learn is skill.

&gt;  I've had some back and forth with folks on here that say its a myth that prices go up if labor increases. That might be true for huge corporate franchised organizations, but it is far from true for your average local small business owner. 

Again, it's about the margin you're operating on. I don't disagree with you at all here, but the point is that most small businesses can't afford full time accountants who can nickel &amp; dime every single aspect of their tax policy, nor can they afford the time or money to invest in local politics. Larger companies simply have more padding to work with, and more resources at hand. Simply helping my mother out for 10-15 hours each week was enough to cut her costs significantly, not to mention a huge tax break that she never knew she could get - she was so busy handling things that she never had the time to research or educate herself on the topic.

&gt;  The last thing you deserve is someone going on Yelp and demonize you for not agreeing with some political talking point that is dramatized by the media or weaponized by a political party.

""Deserve"" is relative. Putting in effort doesn't entitle you to be free of criticisms. Not all of those criticisms are valid, but at the end of the day when you are running a business, you better have the expectation that you will not please everybody, and hopefully have the wisdom in how to keep your head down and avoid becoming a target for public ridicule.  Posting a sign implying that everybody is lazy and living on government handouts isn't a great PR move, especially in an economy where the pay gaps are expanding beyond sustainability. Blaming people for a systemic issue is a sure-fire way of making yourself a public enemy.

&gt; Be kind and tolerant and accept that its OK to disagree as were all grown ups.

This is also a misnomer.  There are certainly topics that it's fair to have disagreements over, but when people's livlihoods are at stake, it's not as simple as that. For example, we shouldn't be kind or tolerant to racists or pedophiles, and in the eyes of most people who are facing a catastrophic economy, saying that we should be ""tolerant and kind"" about opinions is a slap in the face to people who can't afford a place to live. 

The problem here isn't lazy workers or sheisty employers who don't want to pay a fair wage (although this can often be a contributing factor). The real problem is an economy that is rigged against small businesses and low/middle income populations, and a political system that makes these 2 groups think that eachother is the problem.",2021-07-24 07:35:13

In the kitchen manager position the opportunity is to learn and make he job easier to manage and perform well enough to assume more roles for additional money or to leverage your skills and apply for bigger positions at bigger restaurants. In the commission sales position it is a similar path. You could go into management, finance, service…or move to a higher volume dealership. 

Both careers have long abusive hours so you aren’t winning one way or another. You will meet more people in different careers in the sales position. I know many scar salespeople who struck up conversations with customers that later led to job opportunities in other fields, no so much with a kitchen manager. 

Both jobs are hard and failure can lead to instant termination…so not a lot of job security either way if you are not a performer. I would focus on the work environment for each and see what you think fits you the best.",2021-07-24 08:15:21

1) Buy a cheaper car for cash - a Honda or Toyota.  Whoever is going to co-sign on a loan see if you can borrow just enough to buy a decent Corolla or Civic.

2) The other side of the coin is this - find a Civic or Corolla you can finance with manageable payments - the minimum amount to finance with most banks where I am is $7500.  Finance an $8500 Civic/Corolla with your $1000 down and finance the rest. Make sure you make all your payments.

asymmetricloss,"No, you´re highly likely not. Hanging around r/AskStatistics and asking reasonable questions about stuff you´re not sure about would likely suggest you´re at the higher end of the bell curve. I guess it´s not technically wrong to call it ensemble modelling. However, that type of term tends to be used as an umbrella term for aggregating predictions in machine learning. Forecast combinations have been a very researched area during the last 50 years and the main contributors are probably econometricians and statisticians with an interest in economics/finance. There are a lot of these researchers that have been frustrated with how ""people"" re-label forecast combinations as ensemble modelling and ignoring previous research on the topic and acting like they found something new. So it´s not entirely wrong to say ensemble modelling. However, it´s probably more accurate to acknowledge the problem as forecast combinations. However, in the end, these are just words so who gives a shit lol. :)

Also, I think you have misunderstood Bates-Granger weighting. It goes as follows: 1. You compute the mean squared forecast error (MSFE) (either in-sample or out-sample). 2. You take the reciprocal of the MSFE. 3. You divide the reciprocal of each MSFE  with the sum of the MSFEs such that you have weights that are between 0 and 1, and sum to unity. Thus, you give forecasts with higher error (as measured by MSFE) lower weight. This usually works well for several reasons, it is somewhat robust in finite samples and tends to hit the sweet spot when it comes to the bias-variance trade-off.

Yeah sure, there are several other ways. However, simple ways often perform better than more complicated ways due to difficulties in estimating the statistical properties of forecast errors. You should check out ""Handbok of economic forecasting Vol1"" of Timmermann and Graham.  It has a really good chapter on it.",2021-07-24 19:26:45

TechboyUK,"I haven't written an article on DeFi yet, but basically:

DeFi = Decentralised Finance. It's where you and others have control in a collaborative way, without a centralised body being in control.

Some pros:

* It's more secure (as you have full control of your assets i.e. the private keys to your wallet)
* Far less chance of manipulation, theft, etc.

Some cons:

* It's a bit more complicated to use
* Some changes take longer to be implemented because they need a majority vote 

&amp;#x200B;

I maximise my CRO by:

I auto-buy CRO every month.  
  
I put all the CRO I earn into DeFi and re-invest the interest regularly.  
  
I get additional cashback when using my card, by using services like TopCashback and AirTime Rewards (see my [article](https://techboy.medium.com/the-essential-guide-to-the-mco-visa-debit-card-from-crypto-com-61d7b2f358c9) for info).

Sad-Club215,"I agree with your primary point, that sell-offs stabilize the price, and this is good for decentralization in the short run as it allows more consumers a buying opportunity at a lower price.  However, injecting the market and changing the supply in order to maintain a certain price is, by definition, manipulating the market.  The market has two sides, supply and demand.  Since it is the ""producer,"" Algorand has the prerogative of increasing supply to make up for demand when demand increases, at least until the supply is exhausted.  But make no mistake, increasing supply to make up for demand changes the supply curve just as accumulating and holding by individuals and institutions does.

Algorand's mission should be to keep the price as low as possible, as long as possible, while at the same time, allowing for increases so investors get a reasonable return for their investment and do not themselves liquidate their positions.

FYI, I have a decent size holding in Algorand and believe wholeheartedly in the project.  I believe it is the way and the future of finance.",2021-07-25 07:24:27

uglahsD,"Other ""real estate investors"" will insist you keep it, however there is a very sharp learning curve for RE investment that most don't ever realize. 

I could go into a very long list of potential pitfalls, headaches, and disasters of becoming a landlord, but the real concern is, are you financially stable enough to never have to worry about making full monthly payments on both properties? This is on top of other necessary expenses (healthcare, food, bills, insurance, dependant care, etc etc etc).

Not asking you to tell me how rich you think you are; just suggesting food for thought. Not only should you be able to comfortably pay the mortgage, taxes, and insurance on both places even if you were to lose your job(s), you should also have a total of at least 6 months of all of your combined expenses in savings, AND have a very substantial emergency fund in place. 

I've known too many ""investors"" who live paycheck to paycheck, praying nothing goes wrong while they slowly whittle down their mortgages. I've seen many with 6-figure tax liens on their properties. I've seen lots of very ugly stuff. The truth is, most folks aren't real estate experts, they aren't finance experts, they aren't market experts. You'll see a lot of bad advice in this forum and others like it. 

Just pay an actual real financial advisor a fee to review numbers with you. Don't ask a friend, don't ask reddit (lol). Additionally, if you do move forward with renting the property, pay the fee and consult an actual real estate attorney to advise you through the process.

These types of platforms take a cut from your earnings, but then will also boost your rewards with their own token (Pickle Finance will also distribute their Pickle token along with your cut of the rewards).

Stupidstar,"&gt; Wasn't Occupy also saying things like ""don't report crimes, including sexual assault, to the police""? Sounds a lot like BLM.

Brought in by the proto-Wokesters if I recall, but yeah, there was ironically an epidemic of sexual assault that they tried to solve in ways other than going to the police, like a women's-only tent. Also runaway theft.

&gt; And the whole concept of ""rich people bad"" sounds pretty Woke to begin with.

Definitely when it's people railing at the rich for being rich, but I think it had more to do with corporate influence on politics, and how the One Percent had orders of magnitude more wealth than even the top 10% of society.

The ""corporate influence on politics"" is particularly relevant since Occupy happened in the wake of the Great Recession and people had watched the government bail out the big banks. Occupy happened in 2011, and in 2010 the Supreme Court had struck down sections of the bipartisan McCain-Feingold Act that reformed campaign finance, particularly in regards to what corporations are allowed to do. I recall that people on both sides of the aisle were upset about that ruling and worried it would allow companies to essentially put politicians in their pocket.

Regarding the wealth inequality bit, I remember there was an infographic video demonstrating the difference between what people *thought* the wealth distribution looked like in America compared to what it actually was. People thought there was a much more gradual incline between the rich and the poor, and that allowed for upward mobility. The curve is actually much steeper than that.",2021-07-29 13:33:57

yakimawashington,"If you're not planning on grad school, I'd 100% recommend engineering for job outlook and income. Which engineering you choose is 100% up to you, but since you already have the gen chem and o chem out of the way, chemical might be the most efficient route to go. You'll still probably need 3 years anyways since most engineering programs are at *least* three years long from the time you take your first engineering course, but the first of those three years will likely just be a class or two, so you'll have some free time for the first year. If I were in your shoes, I'd consider the following options for that free time while you're doing your first year of only a couple chem e courses:

1) Also start taking the first year of courses of one other engineering discipline. Since you already have physics, math, chem etc out of the way, this should also only be a couple of courses at a time. Going this route will allow you to try chemical and another type of engineering so that you can decide for sure whether you prefer chemical engineering vs another engineering. Chemical might seem like the obvious choice, but most people who switch from chem to chem e will tell you they are very different. If you decide to keep chem e, you will likely have come close to finishing a minor in a different engineering discipline as well, which will be something to add to your resume.

2) Do undergraduate research or a co-op/internship (part time if necessary). You have a great GPA and 2 years of biochem, so you shouldn't have too hard of a time landing one of these opportunities. Prioritize looking for engineering experience.

3) Commit to a minor. If you choose this route, I'd personally recommend computer science or finance. Be ready to work if you choose computer science because there is a steep learning curve if it's your first exposure to programming, but it will open a lot of opportunities when it comes to applying for work/internships down the road, and may even help in your future chem e courses if they require programming (it helped me significantly). Finance is good because a lot of engineering in the private sector is money-driven, and being well-versed in finance can make you an asset to a company you may want to move up in. You'll also help yourself by being finance-savvy (I wish I did this, personally).

That's my advice from someone who did something similar to you. My GPA wasn't nearly as great as yours, but I still managed to land two engineering summer internships before graduating, so you should be in a great spot. What I had going for me was extensive work history (completely unrelated to engineering, but it showed I am capable of being a reliable employee), computer science minor (including C++, algorithm design/analysis, and data structures coursework on my resume looked good), and I'm fairly personable as well. You have a great GPA, so that should help you get your foot in the door, but I've found most companies looking for engineering interns don't care as much about GPA as I thought they would. They mostly care about a good resume, good skills, good work ethic, and good personality. My first internship never even looked at my transcript. My second one had me send it to HR *after* I received my offer letter just to prove I'm studying chemical engineering. They know most engineers who are accepted into their major are already well-enough educated. They find the other things I listed above to be better indicators of how good an engineer you'll be. I actually just finished my second interview for a Tesla internship this week (first was with HR, second was with an engineer). They still haven't seen my transcript and have yet to ask about my grades since they already saw my experience. About to follow up with them tomorrow for an update.

But don't do what a lot of engineering students mistakenly do and go ""why aren't I getting any internships?? I applied to Google, Tesla, Amazon, Space X, Boeing, and not one of them called me back! Is Elon busy or something??"" Sure, go ahead and apply to those, but also apply to other more niche or ""less sexy"" ones too such as mining, waste (nuclear, water etc.), and other local/state ones. Focus on getting *any* first internship on your resume, then your next one will be a lot easier to get. My first engineering internships were ones my classmates never even considered applying for, and now they managed to get me at least considered by Tesla (fingers crossed I get the spot lol)  Either way, FOLLOW UP REGULARLY with any one you apply to until you get a solid yes or no answer.


Anyways, there's a wall of info for you lol. I know it's a bit more than you asked for, but I felt obligated to give you my 2 cents since your situation is nearly identical to what mine was when I made the switch (biochem major, realized I need a masters/PhD just to have a job outlook and salary close to engineering, switched just before reaching upper level courses).",2021-07-30 03:10:16

If you enjoy the work you’re doing that’s a lot better than most people. I wouldn’t consider making an entire career decision based upon 2 weeks of work - 4 months will pass quickly. I can also assure you that the glow of a prestigious degree wears off quite quickly.",2021-07-30 15:12:27

Jawls19881,"Don’t think of this in terms of “freeing up equity”. 

If you’ve got a perfectly good 12k car, why would you be looking to buy another car in a years time, going back to being a 2 car household? Either you need/want 2 cars, or you don’t. If you need 2 cars, little point getting rid of yours now. If you don’t, no point buying another in a year. 

From a personal finance perspective, you want to be on the relatively low points of the depreciation curve for as long as possible (consistent with a hassle factor / old car factor that you can live with). The car you have now is known to you, it’s presumably been looked after, and so on. If you buy another car, then you’re taking a punt on an unknown. 

It makes sense from a personal finance perspective to get a new (to you) car only if:

1. You’re buying something cheaper. Eg. Chop in a 13k A Class, buy a 7k Skoda. This would be the closest you get to a “releasing equity” angle but really you’re just buying something cheaper or

2. Your current car is so much of a banger that it impedes your work or is otherwise a massive inconvenience. 

Of course, you don’t have to think about these things only from a PF angle. If you like cars, you like cars. But then it’s discretionary luxury spending.",2021-08-02 01:00:49

SlyTrout,"Leasing is usually the most expansive way to get a car and less transparent than financing. I highly recommend financing over leasing. I agree with u/BouncyEgg on focusing on getting the best price for the car you want. Most car salespeople will try to keep the conversation in terms of monthly payment. You should only discuss the price of the car.

Since cars, especially new ones, depreciate rapidly, be mindful of that when considering your down payment and loan terms. Be sure to stay ahead of the depreciation curve so you are never upside down on your car. A good thumb rule for this, and to make sure it is not too much of a drain on your finances is to put at least 20% down, finance for no more than three years, and keep the payments less than 8% of your gross income.",2021-08-02 14:17:33

SikhSoldiers,"I'm just going to give you the steps, if you want to understand where the yield is actually coming from that you're getting, it gets complicated bc finance (has to do with the demand for stablecoins so that other people can take leverage positions).

1. buy ETH on the polygon network (cheapest to use)
2. trade that ETH for USDC
3. deposit the USDC into curve finance for an equal split of USDC-USDT-DAI\*
4. optional: Take the token you recieve representing your share of USDC-USDT-DAI and deposit it with pickle finance.
5. when you feel like it, withdraw all your stablecoins, send them to coinbase, and wire the funds back to your bank account

What you're doing here is providing liquidity between the three stablecoins and earning rewards for doing so. Providing liquidity is essentially acting as the market maker in traditional finance. By locking your USD for this you get a percent of the fees the exchange (curve) earns. By using curve on the matic network you earn Matic token rewards that you can sell for extra yield.

* It will indeed give you a leg up in recruitment if you are from an Oxbridge-equivalent university vs. run-of-the-mill local uni student

* It is thus easier to stand out from the pack (i.e. top student from elite foreign uni) vs. a local uni student where you will need to slog like a dog to get First Class Honours etc.
* It is definitely not impossible for local uni students to get into high paying finance jobs, but they probably have to work harder + hustle / network to get them
* Let's say you took the local uni route and got into the high paying finance job that you were targeting: beyond this your career trajectory would largely depend on your own performance / luck - the school you came from should not matter so much anymore.

They began having their propagandists whisper these terms in our ears even before the first 2 weeks to slow the curve were up. We have seen elderly well-connected plutocrats like Nancy Pelosi ignore the lockdowns.

the lockdowns are a psychological warfare attack. This is the only way to make sense of them. From a health policy point of view makes no sense. From an economic POV makes no sense unless you understand how global finance works post-LIBOR fixing revelations and the 2008 bailouts.

nautilus555,"JavaScript isn't in the same category as C/C++. JavaScript is an event-driven scripting language that performs a lot of things synchronously. C/C++ is, unless told otherwise, not event driven and is synchronous. I wouldn't recommend making a library in C/C++ straight away either - there's a steep learning curve for C/C++ coming from other languages. Maybe take a look at Java? It is far more approachable and is definitely easier to create and integrate libraries. Java is probably a better option for finance/accounting given that you will be dealing with non-integer numbers a lot (which can be difficult with C/C++ if you have to convert between strings and numbers as you would do often in an accounting/finance library).",2021-08-04 08:03:58

\------------------------------------------------------------

One of the myths blown apart in the global financial crisis and now the COVID-19 pandemic is that governments that own the printing press need taxpayers to finance their spending.  
  
Again, the familiar strains of “Who will pay for this?” or better still, “We are burdening our children,” have arisen as the federal government has been called upon to help get us through this crisis.

These calls ignore the basic fact that governments don’t need taxes to spend. Unlike the rest of us they spend first, tax later, because they can create money that they need never repay.  
  
When the government spends it puts dollars in people’s pockets and creates activity. This in turn should create activity, confidence and most importantly employment. If there is excess capacity in the economy they need not drain all the money back through taxes. They need only drain enough to make sure inflation is kept under control.  
  
The net result, or budget position, is merely an accounting outcome in the search for low inflation and full employment.  
  
If the government runs a deficit there are then two choices. The usual choice is to drain the money back by issuing Treasury bonds so that money spent is all accounted for by taxes and bond issuance. However, the government through the Reserve Bank of Australia can leave the money out there, monetising the debt, by simply having the central bank buy the bonds. Even more efficient would be direct financing, but for now it seems a bridge too far.  
  
Do you need evidence of this simple fact? Well, since the start of 2020, in those bushfire-ravaged, pre-pandemic days that seem so long ago, the government – via the Australian Office of Financial Management – has issued an extra $250 billion of Treasury bonds. The RBA has bought $180 billion. Better still, the RBA is likely to buy at least another $130 billion of bonds by June next year, more than matching the AOFM’s issuance. No private investors required. The government is quite rightly financing itself.

For governance reasons the RBA is at pains to draw a distinction between its actions and those of state and federal governments, but they are effectively all the same body: our government, trying to achieve the same goal of full employment.  
  
So, what happens when these bonds held by the RBA mature? Well, that all depends on whether the economy is booming. If the economy is booming, and capacity constraints are causing an inflation problem, then government should be draining money from the system. This means a healthy surplus for the government which can be used to repay the RBA. Intra-government accounting assets and liabilities can be deleted.  
  
If the economy still has excess capacity and inflation is not a problem, then the RBA should simply roll its bond holdings. If you want an example of how it all looks down the track, the Bank of Japan owns half of all Japanese government bonds. Put another way, the Bank of Japan has printed money to pay for half of the net activity by the Japanese government, rather than hitting up taxpayers. And the result? An inflation rate still barely above zero.  
  
So why haven’t we done this all along? Well, it is not new. The US did it during World War II, instituting yield curve control at 2.5 per cent for Treasury bonds and 0.375 per cent for Treasury bills in 1942, even as inflation pushed up to double digits at the peak of the war. Some form of control remained in place for a decade. However, by the 1980s the combination of high inflation and free-market thinking meant central banks, not governments, became the controllers of economic cycles.  
  
Governments were told to get out of the way of the efficient private sector and balance their budgets. Armed with independence, central banks would use monetary policy levers to let the private sector flourish.  
  
Unfortunately, despite the compelling narrative the private sector proved even more incapable of controlling cycles. As Chuck Prince, chief executive of Citi, the US bank, said in 2007, “as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing”.

Then, after the GFC, central banks were overly concerned about inflation despite animal spirits being crushed by the crisis. Tony Abbott was busy plying the line of repaying Labor’s debt.  
  
Now the cat is out of the bag let’s hope the RBA and the government don’t put it back in. The needs of the Australian economy remain high, both short and long term. The government has the means and capability of attacking them. Inflation is not about to run away. Government deficits and debt matter far less than most of us had been led to believe.  
  
Investors need to recognise that big government is here to stay. Whether it is tackling healthcare, subsidising environmental initiatives or making sure Australians who want to work have a job, we are entering a new era.  
  
Margaret Thatcher may have said “there is no such thing as society” but environmental and health crises remind us there is. We have now given our governments permission to be far more active and the ability to pay for it is there. Even as many of us remain locked down there is good reason to be optimistic about our future.",2021-08-04 09:04:12

lamdacore-2020,"I have done both kinds of designs in my experience. There was a time that people considered doing L3 up to the edge as it solved so many L2 problems like STP convergence, storm control, etc. But it introduced a whole set of new problems i.e. now you had to do some good routing design and the choice of protocols was a must. Secondly, troubleshooting a defective host i.e. you would first have to determine where the host is with respect to their IP (look up route table and trace to an edge rack) then you would look at the MAC table to pin point the exact port i.e. a two step process. You can improve on that with time and good documentation and design....but we all know that quickly goes out the window once you need to make so many changes that you cant keep the documentation up to date.  
  
L2 has matured a lot and now you get stacked switches, port-channelling via MLAG and with high bandwidth transceivers almost eliminates the problems of the past. Yes, STP still runs but there are no loops thanks to these technologies. The other benefit is that it makes things plug and play and makes it easy for network admins to maintain their networks.  
  
However, there are places where you must be religious in terms of network design and choosing the correct topology e.g. datacentres and the emergence of IaaS which requires plenty of scalability and rapid expansion. In such places, L2 can scale as rapidly. Instead, L3 provides much better scalability and L2 traffic is maintained using newer technologies like VXLAN.  
  
So, my advise is, do not turn your production network into a CCIE lab because you will be in a world of hurt when things go bad. If you can stick to L2, continue on. And now to answer your questions:  
  
1 - I dont think they do because they are meant to perform end host switching. However, I am not too across virtual switches but my experience is that they are almost always configured as L2 switches. The pinned NICs simply perform VLAN tagging and trunk to an upstream physical switch.  
  
2 - If you stick with L2, you probably just need to make minor changes, you get proper stackable switches and the core is in an MLAG configuration and you have multiple SFPs, then you will find the configuration to be a lot more simple and no need for L3. If it is L3, then yes, it is more than just getting switching and/or routing design. You will need to make sure all your interconnects have an IP address as well. You will need to apply more routing controls.  
  
3 - If you go down the path of L3 per access layer, then the VLAN scope is limited to that closet only. This means floor one may have VLANs 10, 20, and 30 and assigned to the Marketing department. Then on Floor two, you can re-use the same VLANs but assigned to another L3 subnet and then given entirely to another team like Finance. However, imagine the confusion where the re-use of VLANs is the same and you mix up VLAN 10 of Marketing with VLAN 10 or Finance. You will overcome that at some point but it will be high learning curve for the new engineer. The L3 access switch is now default gateway of all host connecting to their respective VLANs in the specific closet.  
  
4- Nope, every link will now need to have its own unique subnet for routing purposes. You will have to choose between routing protocols. If you choose OSPF, you may want to regrain from creating a single Area 0 (backbone) network. Your core can be your backbone and each floor distribution will be a particular area. OR the core and distribution can be a single Area 0 and each access layer can be its own unique area. So many design options here. The effort will be significant but if it is worth it then go for it. If it simply because you like to do it...that is not really a good enough reason. As you transition, there is a high chance of making mistakes some of which can be critical.  
  
5 - No, firewalls have the capability of zoning. You simply create the appropriate zones and configure the rules. One zone may be your internal network and then things like guest and iot etc can be their own zones. Then there will be a zone for DMZ or internet etc. You simply block them accordingly. However, this is old school security, what you would do, ideally, is use something like a NAC that does dynamic VLAN assignment irrespective of where the host is on your network. Different NAC solution provide additional layers of Layer 2 security and traffic gets blocked before even reaching the firewall. In one environment, the corporate network used 10.0.0.0/8 but guest and IoT were given 192.168.0.0/24 which were routed directly to the internet gateway. We suppressed this route from ever being learned on the OSPF network.",2021-08-04 15:10:05

Keep in mind, even if you successfully implemented a new spreadsheet software at your company,  you still have vendors, customers, and govt  regulation agencies to deal with. Guess what they all use?.......Excel. Maybe you could influence them to switch over to the new program but that'll be tough.  Maybe Google Sheets might be the future? They're following in Microsofts footsteps by creating an ecosystem to pair with it by making their own PowerPoint and Word.

The other issue is that Excel is a low learning curve ""sandbox"" software that's sort of a jack of all trades. Python or other languages are better at heavy calculations, Minitab is better at statistical analysis, and MS Access is better at database management.  However Excel can do all these things, just not nearly as well. Additionally, it can easily interface with other MS Office programs like PowerPoint and Word. Combine that with the low learning curve, and you understand why it's so hard to beat.


For instance, if you're working with the Finance Dept internally, or a govt agency, or customer, or a vendor, you can guarantee they'll understand your data if it's in Excel format. The same can't be said for Python, Minitab, etc. Maybe in niche applications where those tools are industry standard, but not for general purposes.",2021-08-04 23:50:01
samdachemist,"You can lend out stable coins, that is crypto pegged to the dollar, both on centralized exchanges for 5-10% returns and on decentralized protocols for 10%+.  

Coinbase gives 4% interest on USDC (us dollar coin).  BlockFi gives 7.5% on USDT (us dollar tether) and USDC on up to 50k for each theoretically giving you a savings account earning 7.5%.  

[See this article for information on Coinbase.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/07/05/how-risky-is-coinbases-4-interest-rate-on-usd-coin/)

When it comes to DeFi (decentralized finance) individuals can take the place of large financial institutions both in P2P lending and as market makers on decentralized exchanges.  Individuals provide liquidity and capture the fees that a market maker would otherwise get.  Different market pairings give different incentives increasing and decreasing what fees liquidity providers get.  

Curve is a DeFi protocol that allows someone to provide liquidity solely for stable coins.  You ""stake"" stable coins in a pool of 3-4 stables and earn a return on the pool \~10%.  

People provide liquidity for curve because it gives higher return than anything else for stables and you own your keys instead of relying on a centralized exchange to hold them.  People use curve as an exchange because the fees are lower than other exchanges and because curve is decentralized you own your keys while doing the exchanging.  

Why do people exchange stables?  Because there are arbitrage opportunities with crypto and sometimes different stables paired with a coin like wETH or wBTC will earn wildly different amounts for their liquidity providers. 

This is probably super confusing.  I'm more into crypto than most people I know and i don't fully understand the intricacies of DeFi.  You can always head over to r/defi and read more there.",2021-08-05 03:13:41

awhhh,"It’s really not as a leftist trying to create freedom via post scarcity in the open source and arguably the biggest advocates for freedom on the internet that even includes piracy. 

They’re all right to some extent, but they’re missing a massive component to freedom and that’s free thought. Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook have people regurgitating *rhetoric* that’s usually cultivated in some think tank that has every desire to narrow speech into it arena to dominate it. It’s these people who creating the rules that Zizek is talking about, and that’s where I take problem. 

At times I’m personally not called a leftist, because abandoned the idea of equality. It doesn’t exist in economics, and never will socially. Because everything exists in scarcity, our time, resources, access to those resources, and so on. It will always revert to a utopian idea that can’t and won’t exist. The only liberty is to me is liberty that can be *more accessible* to everyone regardless of race, social standings, and political ideology. The post scarcitists, and anyone the believes socialism in a demand economy, take this on, and we’re by far the most successful ideological framework given that the entire planets economy is built on the back of our contribution. 

Lowkey tried to point out that ideas will die, but let them die naturally then. He wants to hate on Zuck and Dorsey, while also ally with them when it’s convenient. Zizek is right, there’s rules, but they’re mostly made by the platforms that create scarcity for the sake of profit. But the problem is the monopolies are extinguishing rules now by even banning them from hardware like Apple App Store, or even Amazon AWS. These companies benefit from our contributions, but choose to gatekeep the end product from use. 

The problem I have with all 3 of them is they will always have to create a bigger dystopian world with cherry picked evil than it is. Where lowkey is the worst because there’s an actual want for power over another ideology by enforcement. The point at which that left bothers me is through the rhetoric they create for righteous grandstanding that is no different than the right wing authoritarians. The rhetoric evades nuance, and the left is now becoming extremely guilty of this. Most leftist I know will generalize whole systems as capitalist or socialist to create black and white or good and evil in a unified way that matches the rights god complex. For example two people in finance might talk about how monetary policy is setup to hurt people or benefit them, instead of jumping into a nuanced but highly important issue like fractional reserves vs yield curve control, they’ll label the entire system as evil and cherry-pick fancy sounding points. 

Ok, so I’ve lost the point a bit, but there’s a problem that those three doesn’t see I’m the very irony of how they’re perpetuating this nonsense. I would say Zizek least of all, because he’s more so making observations and saying that’s probably why it’s like that, where the other two are making assertions.",2021-08-07 08:09:08

la102,"OPINION:  
  
It is becoming clear that the economic response to the Covid-19 pandemic has been overdone.  
  
As a result of massive fiscal expansion and the loosest monetary policy in living memory, the country is awash in both borrowed and printed money. And our unusually constrained economy can't expand fast enough to absorb all that cash. We are overheating.  
  
Inflation is already running at an annual rate of 3.3 per cent; and most price growth has happened in the last six months. If the second half of this year runs like the first, we are heading to 4 per cent plus inflation by the end of the year.

&amp;#x200B;

Unemployment is at 4 per cent which normally would be considered unambiguously good news. But this time round it is more evidence of severe capacity constraints.  
Because of our largely closed borders, plus a government which is philosophically determined to keep skilled workers out under almost any circumstances, our workforce is growing at nothing like it has in the past. Add a bit of demand-side growth, and businesses, hospitals and the like quickly run out of people to hire.  
The rapid re-emergence of inflationary pressures seems to have surprised many people, including the Reserve Bank Governor. As late as the end of May, the Bank was telling everyone it would maintain its current stimulatory settings in order to meet its policy goals.

&amp;#x200B;

That's despite many people, including this writer, warning as far back as February that inflation was likely re-emerging. The Governor is supposed to be ahead of the curve, not behind it.  
No reasonable person could be too critical of the initial pandemic response by either Grant Robertson or Adrian Orr. With the country plunged into level 4 lockdown, fiscal support for suddenly curtailed businesses was crucial. And dropping interest rates and releasing more cash was a sensible macro-economic response. The main problem has been the period since Christmas.  
The Governor and his Monetary Policy Committee have stuck to their ""least regrets"" expansionary policies all year, despite clear signals they needed to be cut back to limit inflation and soaring house prices.

&amp;#x200B;

It was only three weeks ago that they bowed to the obvious and announced the end of large-scale bond purchases (what we know as quantitative easing). Inexplicably they still haven't stopped lending printed money to the banks at tiny interest rates to ""keep borrowing costs down"" at the same time.  
All this means interest rate rises are now going to have to be sharper and greater than they would have been if the brakes had been tapped a few months ago. The big banks are pricing an increase of up to 1.5 per cent over the next 18 months. If that happens, it's going to hurt borrowers, especially people with large mortgages.  
You must have some sympathy for those who entered the housing market in the last year or so. One of the deliberate effects of ultra-low interest rates is to boost asset prices, so people who own those assets feel wealthier and spend more than they otherwise would. It also means first-home buyers take on more debt to get into a house which costs significantly more than it otherwise would.  
Then, once they are in the house, interest rates are going to hike up because inflation and house prices have gone up too much. Those unfortunate first home buyers will get whacked both ways.  
But it's not just the Reserve Bank Governor who should be questioned over the timing of his decisions. The Finance Minister is taking a far too passive approach to the country's changing economic circumstances.

&amp;#x200B;

Only this week he was in the media washing his hands of our pending interest rate hikes, along the lines of ""we do what we do and the bank will do what it does"". Not so fast.  
His first problem is that the Government has just kept on spending, despite strong signs the economy is recovering. And the quality of that spending has dropped dramatically in the last nine months.  
It's one thing to support people's livelihoods during a government-imposed set of public health restrictions. It's an entirely different thing to spend a bunch of borrowed cash you've put aside for future possible lockdowns on all sorts of ""nice to haves"" that have nothing to do with the pandemic.  
This year's Budget was a doozy, with $20 billion in extra spending over four years, despite it being clear by Budget Day we are having a better pandemic economically than most other countries.  
That's pump-priming on a grand scale; which in turn stokes inflation and the need for interest rate increases. The more the Finance Minister spends, the more the Governor will have to take away the proverbial punch bowl.  
The Finance Minister's other problem is the negative impact the government's wider policies are having on both inflation and economic capacity. The Government is at least partially culpable for the increase in electricity costs, wage inflation (through its big hikes to the minimum wage and increased leave entitlements), and our impossibly restrictive labour market. All these make the Reserve Bank Governor's job harder, and New Zealand an outlier in the inflation stakes amongst developed countries.  
Belatedly, and possibly with the help of a poll or two, the Government is showing signs of waking up to its simultaneous strangling and overheating of the New Zealand economy.  
This week we are told RSE workers from Covid-free pacific islands won't have to quarantine any more; that the totemically wasteful Auckland bike bridge is probably toast; and the Government is, possibly, maybe, going to take some steps to improve the ability of businesses to get crucial workers through the mess that is MIQ. But it is all incredibly late.  
These steps and other corrective actions could have been taken months ago; and the spending on the bike bridge along with a stack of other low priority items could have been nixed before they were announced.  
There are plenty of things that are not of the Government's or Reserve Bank's making that are helping boost inflation. They have no control over Opec, or Joe Biden's profligate spending in the US, or indeed the world's logistics logjam.  
But they can see them all happening, and alter their own response accordingly.  
That would be a true ""least regrets policy"". Unfortunately it looks more like we've had a ""set and forget"" policy, and borrowers are about to feel the sharp end of that.

SecondAccount404,"# Article text

&gt;The U.K. has set one of the most ambitious carbon emission-reduction targets among major economies, making the country a case study in how climate goals call for big shifts in policy, the economy and technology.  
&gt;  
&gt;Britain is one of several heavy polluters including the U.S., China and the European Union to have unveiled emission plans in the run-up to the United Nations climate conference in Scotland this fall. Fires in North America and in Russia’s northeast, flooding in Europe and China and a severe drought in Brazil have injected additional urgency into diplomatic efforts to limit the rise in global temperatures.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a bid to establish the U.K.’s environmental bona fides ahead of the conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the country will reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 78% from 1990 levels by 2035. President Biden, meanwhile, aims to halve U.S. emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels. China is targeting a peak in emissions by 2030.  
&gt;  
&gt;How Britain fares, having already made deeper cuts than other G-20 economies, will offer the U.S. and other countries clues about the steps needed. Emissions in the U.K. fell by 40% from 1990 through 2019, largely because it pivoted away from coal and toward renewable sources of energy in the electricity industry.  
&gt;  
&gt;Further reductions would likely bring tough changes in areas including transportation, housing and industry, according to energy executives, bankers and investors. Companies are paying attention: Firms from major oil companies such as BP BP 0.87% PLC to auto makers such as Tesla Inc. TSLA -2.17% are vying to make money from the U.K.’s transition.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.K. government is committed to meeting its targets and will publish a plan for reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 before the U.N. conference, a spokesman said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here are the five things the U.K. is focused on: Electricity Generation  
&gt;  
&gt;Cleaning up power generation is key because climate plans in the U.K. and elsewhere depend on electrifying swaths of the economy, including transportation and some energy-intensive industrial processes. The U.K. has made quicker progress on this than most other major economies: Wind power alone provided about 25% of electricity in 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;The next step, according to the Climate Change Committee—a panel of external advisers that guides and reports on the government’s efforts to get to net zero—is to generate electricity from entirely low-carbon sources by 2035. That will require billions of dollars to finance offshore-wind farms in particular.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fierce competition is under way to dominate the offshore-wind market, pitting early movers such as Denmark’s Ørsted AS ORSTED 0.63% , Norway’s Equinor AS EQNR 1.74% A and U.K. utility SSE SSEZY 1.09% PLC against newer entrants including BP. “Electricity’s definitely the place to be,” SSE Chief Executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said. Power Storage and Transmission  
&gt;  
&gt;Switching to a power system dominated by renewables at a time of rising power demand will test the reliability of electricity supplies and the stability of the grid.  
&gt;  
&gt;The wind doesn’t always blow, so storing electricity will be crucial, said Robert Gross, a professor of energy policy and technology at Imperial College London. Some of the technology needed to do this, such as pumping water uphill with electricity before releasing it to drive a turbine, has been in use for decades. Other technologies, such as batteries or green hydrogen, are still being developed or remain commercially unviable on an industrial scale.  
&gt;  
&gt;More offshore electrical connections need to be built each year than have been constructed in any year ever, said Nicola Shaw, U.K. president at National Grid PLC. Transportation  
&gt;  
&gt;Cars and other forms of surface transportation are now the biggest source of emissions in the U.K. The country must quickly convert its fleet to run on electricity, according to the government’s advisers.  
&gt;  
&gt;So far this year, fully electric cars have accounted for just 8.1% of the market. Vehicles made by Tesla, Nissan Motor Co. NSANY -0.09% and Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC are the most popular.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.K. would also need to expand its network of public charging points by more than 10 times by 2030. Buildings  
&gt;  
&gt;Another source of emissions that the U.K. has largely failed to plug comes from buildings. Reducing these will depend on insulation and draft-proofing, and on moving from natural-gas boilers to alternative sources of heat.  
&gt;  
&gt;The need to re-equip millions of homes could be a moneymaker for utilities such as Centrica CPYYY 1.33% PLC, investors say. Mortgage lenders such as NatWest Group NWG 2.04% PLC are looking to see if they can offer financial incentives to make homes more efficient. Carbon Capture and Hydrogen  
&gt;  
&gt;Hitting the U.K.’s longer-run target of net-zero emissions by 2050 would involve cleaning up sectors such as manufacturing and construction. Doing so would partly rely on less-established technologies such as using hydrogen to fire furnaces and kilns, and on capturing and storing carbon. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS  
&gt;  
&gt;Do you think the U.K. will reach its climate goals? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.  
&gt;  
&gt;One big company pinning its hopes on carbon capture is Drax Group DRXGY 39.14% PLC, which produces about 6% of the U.K.’s electricity. In June, Drax struck a deal to use Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Group’s carbon-capture solvent at its power plant in Yorkshire, which has been converted to run on wood pellets instead of coal.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.K. doesn’t yet have all the policies in place to eliminate emissions from the power system, said Drax Chief Executive Will Gardiner. “But there’s still time to get the curve to the right place,” he said.",2021-08-09 07:09:07

DaddyDelts,"I just switched to Mac after spending my entire college and working experience on a PC. I have the whole apple ecosystem (iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, etc.).

While I like many of the features of macOS such as the text messaging, shared clipboard and side car.  I have found the switch very challenging. 

I would consider myself a power user of excel and other programs where I extensively and almost exclusively used shortcut keys. Losing those has made my workflow much slower, I love the gestures on Mac, but it has taken a lot of getting used to.

Finder is no match for file explorer. And as above posters have said many apps are made for Mac as a second thought rather than a primary focus. It may be my experience but it also seems my 16gb of ram on Mac is less than my 16gb of ram on PC. That may just be my experience with the apps I use not being optimized for Mac as well.

I found that I needed to install parallels (well bootcamp + parallels) to get much of my work done.

I am in finance though, so most of my work requires Microsoft products. The fact that windows can be run on Mac, but not vice versa is what ultimately got me to stick with my MBP. If I was in design, programming, or other creative spaces I think I would love the more artsy feel of MacOS more. 

I know that for me, prior to Mac the only PC on the market I thought were worth getting were the dell xps and the Razerblade stealth as they both come in the 13 or 15” formats. Not sure if that’s still the case.

Gabrielle4Yeg,"Thank you for asking :-). There are so many candidates! And this is a critical time with big issues and difficult decisions looming. **EXPERIENCE MATTERS!** Both work experience and life experience. 

**I am the only candidate in O-day'min that has the experience, skills, dedication and passion to hit the ground running on day one.** All candidates are passionate and nice. I've met most of them and even encouraged Anne to run when she asked. With the exception of Tony, they will all have a learning curve of up to 6 months.

  
What makes me stand out:

**1. financial acumen** \- I've already overseen billion dollar organizations; I've helped govern credit union banking across Canada - therefore, I will be able to understand how the overall picture on how our very complex finances actually work when it comes to budgeting - both capital and operational  
**2. in depth city council governance &amp; oversight knowledge** \- I currently train other city councils and boards on best practices in governance, oversight, process and building consensus. I deliver the city council 101 mandatory courses.  
**3. I am a lawyer and have been a chief risk officer** \- I understand the intricacies of risk management and legal issues. When those come before Council (and they will every time), I will ask the important questions and will have understood what I've read to be able to get the right information and help convey it - I will also know what's missing and where the gaps are  
**4. I worked in the energy industry from both a profit side and an environmental protection side** \- I understand the climate change issues and environmental concerns - I can immediately dive into files like Blatchford and GHG emissions, understanding how to make practical and future-focussed change  
**5. I've worked with marginalized individuals in my paid and volunteer roles** \- I have experienced using a women's shelter for safety, losing my home, and being poor. I have lived in ""core"" neighbourhoods. I know what it's like to have a disability and to care for those with disabilities. I will not disregard the voices of those who need me most. I will actively seek them out so that they are heard along with all Edmontonians - and I will push for truly inclusive culture change. I have created NFP orgs for vulnerable people and supported diversity, anti-racism, inclusion, accessibility and change.  
**6. I have worked in the policing environment in Edmonton** and already have a deep understanding of the challenges and successes. I am already trying to change systemic issues through creation of the Coalition of Canadian Police Reform. I support systemic change, but I do not support defunding (that's not how finance works and not how you make real change).  
**7. I do tons of pro bono legal work for marginalized communities, people and organizations.** I believe in giving back and I know the power of personal communication, accountability and transparency. I teach it. I will deliver a personal scorecard on a quarterly basis to account for how I am doing against the outcomes I promised and that are important to my Ward and to Edmontonians.  
**8. I am an ethics investigator.** I investigate breaches of Codes of Conduct. I will not put up with that on my watch and I know where changes need to be made.

**9. I have a practical, common sense approach that has been informed by diverse life experiences.**

**10. I live in and operate businesses in my own ward.**",2021-08-10 05:49:45

Frankly, I'm 100% in crypto. Every pay check I get I move to a yield farm where I earn 30-40% on USD, never going to get that from your bank. There's a bit of a learning curve but at the end of the day the risk is quite low. Some of these systems have billions of dollars in them, so they are quite obviously trusted by people. Again though, they're new so they're still maturing. In time the reward rates will lower as they are adopted, but these models are innovative and are likely to be used by banks in the future. If banks don't adopt these systems, they'll mostly be made redundant.

pegasi_admin,"First off, congratulations and well done on completing your degree.

I wouldn’t worry that you’re perhaps feeling unprepared and perhaps a bit overwhelmed. Making the change from student to practitioner is tough. One important thing to remember is that your more experienced colleagues were in your exact situation once, feeling what you’re feeling, and if they can do it – so can you.

Regarding your first concern (specialisation): most translators I know professionally and personally (myself included) didn’t actually have a specialisation when they started their careers. So, the path they’ve had to take to specialise is: get a broad range of experience (in various fields) to begin with in the first few years, work out which of the major fields they enjoy translating in (e.g. finance), then drill down to specialise in a specific niche area a few years down the line (e.g. fintech).

Secondly, regarding CAT tools: I believe this is one shortcoming of translation programs, that they don’t actually give students many insights into the day-to-day tools that translators might use. I do generally feel, though, that they’re best learned on the job, so I don’t think you need to worry about not having any experience as yet. The likes of YouTube’s sure to have tutorials for various tools. You’ve already mentioned OmegaT (which, unfortunately, I can’t advise on, having never used it myself), but CaféTran Espresso is also free (albeit within certain limitations). CTE is certainly more [affordable](https://www.cafetran.com/get-cafetran/) than Trados and memoQ, although do also bear in mind that both Trados and memoQ both offer 30-day free trials, and with memoQ agencies can also grant you a licence to work on their projects once the trial version has expired.

Regarding useful glossaries and dictionaries, I’m not sure I’m best placed to advise on useful ones, not working with Spanish myself, but one thing I would advise is reading around extensively in whatever field you choose. Google is your friend here – good research skills are one of the hallmarks of a competent translator, along with a passion for and mastery of the chosen languages, and good writing skills.

It will take time, but I do believe you’ll get there in the end. The initial learning curve and startup process can be tough (especially if you’re launching your freelance career straight out of university), but get through the first year or two and you’ll find it gets so much easier from then on. The first couple of years are the hardest; persist and you’ll reap the rewards. All the best, buddy.",2021-08-10 10:49:07
drKRB,"Sorry for your loss.

I do not claim to be an expert, but have studied investing and personal finance extensively and teach in a related field. 

Not financial advice, but if it were my money I would take $5,000 - $10,000 and put it in a bank account that you can use over the next year or two to help with life expenses. This will help lightened the load of everyday life for the short term. 

Next I would take the balance (Approximately $40,000) and seek out a professional investment advisor to help prepare a portfolio for you that will make life easier in retirement. Please prepare for it now because you will be so glad you did. It may seem far away, but 10 to 15 years can slip by and then you’re half way to retirement and then feel behind. With that kind of money and a long time line, it can double many times: 40 becomes 80, to 160, to 320, to $640,000. Compound interest and time is your friend. 

Additionally, I would consider a 5-10% allocation to Bitcoin with the rest going into mutual funds that invest in known companies (Think: apple, Amazon, Facebook, google, Starbucks, etc.). Bitcoin has a steep learning curve, but it’s worth learning about. Google: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin. Do some research.

pmuens,"To learn Smart Contract and dApp development you can check out the CryptoDevHub Wiki's ""Getting Started"" guide: https://cryptodevhub.io/wiki/blockchain-development-tutorial

It teaches you everything you need to know to get from complete beginner to proficient Smart Contract engineer.

The Wiki also has a DeFi page with lots of resources you can browse through: https://cryptodevhub.io/wiki/defi

In terms of DeFi codebases I'd recommend that you read the code of a project you're already familiar with. That way you know what to expect. Good codebases IMHO are the Curve one (written in Vyper and well documented), Harvest strategies and yearn strategies:
- https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract
- https://github.com/harvest-finance/harvest-strategy
- https://github.com/yearn/yearn-protocol

For the yearn case there's also a useful repo which walks through the architecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gwZk-IaMRs It's a little bit ""outdated"" but still worthwhile to watch IMHO (you only need to watch the 1st half).

When diving in you can start with the test cases as they simulate real-world interactions with the contracts.

If you're looking for tutorials on how to integrate with existing DeFi projects you should check out the ""Smart Contract Programmer"" YouTube Channel: https://cryptodevhub.io/wiki/ethereum-virtual-machine-media#smart-contract-programmer There's a dedicated playlist which shows you how you can e.g. do flash loans or integrate with Compound and Aave.

There's also the ""Money Legos"" project you should check out (especially their docs): https://cryptodevhub.io/wiki/defi#money-legos

I would often run through the prior day's topics in the shower in the morning, study during downtime at work, then study more when I got home. 

If I didn't understand a topic I would write about the topic, do some out of material research, and get to where I could explain it to a friend who is not a finance professional.

C0SMICLUX,"i think it may be doable but it may be very painful at times. i’d only do this if you aren’t planning on working and won’t be heavily involved in extracurriculars. people have done similar schedules before but not sure at what cost. like for example if getting all As is important then i’d probably stick to 16 units instead

the 201/270 combo can be pretty rough depending on who you have, so i /would/ advise against 20 units with those courses, although from my experience 307, 302, and 312 (i took that course out of the 3) are not too hard. but it just might get tough during midterm season and especially by the end of the semester as you have finals and your group project for 201, which could bite you in the ass especially if you don’t pace it well. 270 is a VERY important course and it would be good if you have a good grasp on algorithms. BUT, i do know people have done 20 units with 201/270/407 or the like, so it’s not IMPOSSIBLE.

for your second semester i feel like your mileage can vary. definitely way more manageable than the first but also depends on how strong you are with finance concepts (it wasn’t too hard for me but i’ve heard some conflicting levels of difficulty). 304 is just a trash class which might tank your gpa with its curve, and the GE-C+G i took was LING 115, which was really, really easy, and depending on your CS elective, it could just feel like a more work heavy 16 unit semester. HOWEVER, i’ve heard varying things about 310 and while i have not taken that specific class yet i’ve heard it’s pretty annoying and can be a time sink sometimes.

so tldr: depending on a lot of things like how confident you are with the subject of your classes, etc. your mileage may vary. honestly if you really want to stick with your schedule, you can just see how you feel before the add/drop deadline, but be aware of how it may feel during finals vs. the first few weeks. people have done 20 units in CS before so i know it’s not impossible but may come at a cost of grades, sleep, or social life if you struggle with certain classes/topics. just don’t overwhelm yourself with classes! just bc it’s doable or not impossible doesn’t mean you should always do it. definitely better to take it a bit easy than to have it topple down on you at rough parts of the semester. obviously i don’t know you so i don’t know what your bandwidth is/your limit so i’m just speaking from a realistic perspective. if you know your limits and this is where they are, great, but also don’t forget about junior year recruiting which is… pretty time consuming 🥶",2021-08-12 00:58:30

MateBeatsTea,"&gt;That's a case of the government completely fucking up with knee jerk policy and nothing related to the relative costs of nuclear and wind/solar.

The relative cost of wind/solar to nuclear a decade ago where way worse than today, let alone 20 years ago when the EEG kicked in. So a lot of that money went into feed-in-tariffs (subsidies) to finance early adoption, and that's also why there will be a lot of inertia in terms of running costs for the German grid in the coming years, as a lot of generation has landed 20-year guaranteed tariffs during the last decade when average costs for new capacity were much larger.

Renewable enthusiasts will roll their eyes and tell you that those costs were justified, because they sent the solar and wind industry down the learning curve path whose results we are seeing today with much lower LCOEs. And I partially agree, but the point remains that Germany could have chosen the nuclear path and have cleaned up its grids for a similar total bill and probably for much less, while restarting the nuclear industry in Europe with a dozen EPRs.

3. Polycat
4. Autofarm

# Exchanges

1. **QuickSwap**: Next-gen Layer 2 DEX. Trade at lightning-fast speeds with near-zero gas fees.

# Liquidity Pools

1. **Curve Finance**: Curve is an exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum (like Uniswap) designed for: extremely efficient stablecoin trading low risk, supplemental fee income for liquidity providers, without an opportunity cost.
2. Quickswap
3. SushiSwap
4. Balancer

# Porfolio Tracker

1. **DeBank**: DeBank is a multichain portfolio tracker that allows you keep track of your own and other peoples portfolios across multiple networks

3. Aavegotchi
4. Cometh

# Bridges

1. **Polygon Bridge:** The Polygon Bridge is the main bridge between the Ethereum network and the Polygon network.

collywallydooda,"Lots of strategies but if you want to keep it simple you can borrow USDC then deposit it into the stable pool on polygon Curve, usually upwards of 10% interest. Many other options available like stable pools on beefy finance with higher returns.

I stick to borrowing USDC, USDT borrows tend to randomly skyrocket in interest rates to 10-20+%. Also try calculating what market value of your coin would see you liquidated and set some price alerts with your favourite app to give you warning. To do this check the ""liquidation threshold"" for your deposited coin, lets use BTC as an example, which is 75%. If the value of what you've borrowed reaches more than 75% of your deposited BTC value then you might be liquidated.

I'll use some extra old BTC values to keep it easy :)

BTC value: $1200
Deposit: 1 BTC
Borrowed: $750
Liquidation threshold: 75%

You have $1200 deposited, the liquidation threshold is 75% of what you've deposited making it $900. If you've borrowed more than your liquidation amount then you'll be liquidated, but you're ok for now because you've only borrowed $750, giving you $150 spare. However, if the BTC value drops to $1000, with the liquidation threshold at 75% that would mean your limit is $750, your current amount borrowed. At this point you'd be up for liquidation.

In this instance you might want to set an alert if the BTC price drops to say, $1100? Depends how much risk you are ok with, the main point is to give yourself enough time to withdraw some of what you've borrowed from where you've deposited it to pay back some of the loan and avoid liquidation.

repawel,"I recommend the same: Lido Finance, and then (when it finally arrives) Rocket Pool.

**I don't recommend any custodial staking. Like for example Binance which has some legal problems currently, so I'm happy I don't have any money frozen in this company.**

Currently Lido seems the best for me. They give you stETH tokens back which you can trade. You can increase your profits by locking stETH and ETH on Curve to earn LDO on incentivized pool (there are also CRV incentives and trading fees, but they are currently not very profitable). You can later sell LDO for ETH, stake it, put into the pool and so on.

There is a very attractive Yearn Finance's Vault ""crvSTETH"" which automates all of this, and makes you pay low gas fees. If you have 1 ETH, then gas fees would kill you if you want to do it manually.

ReverendBlue,"Great post! Thanks for doing the dirty work of outreach to the ""normies"".

So few people understand crypto, even most of us here who are ostensibly way ahead of the curve.  Like 99% of topics out there, people will form a snap judgement about it and then go ahead and block out new information that threatens their perspective.  

Even where there's a true killer app for crypto, it will take a long time to onboard the vast majority of people.  The fact of the matter is that most people, even if they are horribly dissatisfied with the legacy financial system, don't have the imagination to see the world any differently to how they currently see it, or how they've learned that it functions.

In some ways it's the same with climate change; people are starting to acknowledge it as a reality, but can't imagine what its consequences will be, nor how they should act now in order to protect themselves from it.

Crypto is a little different because it's a combination of technology and finance, both subjects that people find threatening in their complexity and inscrutability, but also because people don't see the legacy financial system as a real threat to humanity (despite all the signs).

Like climate change though, people will acknowledge crypto when they are forced to, and let's be honest, they will most likely be forced into using it when CBDCs become mainstream.  This is where the real battle will begin; when CBDCs and 'corpo coins' become totally mainstream, open-source decentralised projects will be a way for people to meaningfully opt out of the legacy financial system.",2021-08-16 10:09:33
baazaa,"It's conceivable a central bank would struggle to control inflation through only this channel as it can hardly start asking for the UBI cheques back. I'd keep open market operations as a mechanism at the same time.

&gt; It seems that by having all money stem from loans issued by central banks at preferable rates to private banks, money is perversely injected into one specific sector of the economy, finance, and thus inflation controls would tend to benefit that sector and only drive consumer demand through loans from banks which seems fundamentally predatory.

There are two types of central bankers.

The first has a mental model which is just, I kid you not, mv=pq. As such they think your suggestion is identical to QE, because all they care about is the quantity of money. Then when the velocity of money plummets because they've pumped cash into banks which are already sitting on a trillion dollars of excess reserves, they just throw up their hands and say they've tried anything. 

The second sort is is what is vulgarly called a supply-sider. They still persist under the delusion that a drop in the interest rate stimulates business loans by dropping the hurdle ROI. And QE can achieve the same by flattening the yield curve. This is of course nonsense, companies often maintain a hurdle rate of like 10% regardless of what the yield curve is doing. Typically cutting interest rates works by stimulating home loans which ultimately increases the money circulating in the real economy, which might cause increased investment but doesn't 'fund' it, which is how you probably imagine it works but the central bankers haven't yet cottoned on.

If you talk to either type about consumer demand you'll just get blank stares, neither of them think it matters or means anything.",2021-08-16 19:57:01

gravis1982,"You need to get into defi my man.  

People are making 20 to 50% per year on Conservative strategies just by collecting fees and liquidity pools, for years now. Look into yearn vaults or curve stable coin pools.  

You think this is ridiculous because Banks don't let normal people participate in this kind of stuff. 

In defi, really smart people have designed extremely complicated strategies that you can join with $10 if you want in 10 minutes from your phone you don't need to ask anyone about anything or wait in line or sign any paperwork or wait for days to get your money back, it just happens, in seconds.


Nexo (which is not defi) gives you 12% on stable coins if you hold 10% of your account balance in nexo coin. And nexo coin it's essentially owning part of the company because you have to own it in order to get good rates.  The value of nexo for example continues to go up. It's almost like owning a share in the company but they would never say that.  Where these really good rewards come from , is lending. Instead of the bank keeping all the income from lending out their money, the system is more decentralized and spreads these profits among the actual users instead of a central entity. Interest rates are also higher because they want your money so they have to give you Great rates. Unlike banks which don't need your money, they just need your equity to leverage it in the market. They have no reason to give you a high interest rate.

World of decentralized finance, or centralized cryptocurrency landing, is slowly but surely starting to mirror the strategies and traditional finance, but it just looks different and sounds different, and CNN tells you it's scary, but there's some very legitimate stuff going on in these money markets if you do your research.  With billions of dollars invested. It's up to you not to pick one that's going to steal your money, and honestly with a few days of reading it's not hard to find the safe havens.",2021-08-17 05:51:08

missquentin,"2 main applications in defi right now.  DEX and lending.

DEX allows users pool assets into a liquidity pool and make markets.  Lending is self explanatory (worth mentioning that all lending that I know of is done with collateral, such that the collateral gets sold if the price drops, so there is not risk of the borrower just stealing funds).

Each project is different and you really need to deep dive into each one and decide a fair price for the token if you want to ""invest"" in defi.  You can always just ape into something if that's what you want.  Many have governance tokens, some have tokens that earn you interest, some have ways for you to use your tokens to earn more money.

What you can also do other than ""invest"" in defi is just use it.  You can lend eth on a lending platform and earn eth, or you can provide liquidity for btc on a DEX and earn BTC.

You really need to go through the docs of a couple projects to understand what they do.  Once you have a frame of reference, you can say ""oh this one is like X but they do Y"".

Some projects you could do a deep dive on:

UniSwap
SushiSwap
QuickSwap
Bancor
Maker DAO
Compound

pr0nh0li0,"&gt;as NRV is providing real utility and we need this on Eth

Hmm I would argue we pretty much already do via Curve/Saddle/Uniswap v3 or one of the dozens of other well optimized stable pools on Ethereum.

[Per Nerve's announcement post](https://nervefinance.medium.com/introducing-nerve-finance-the-first-stableswap-amm-on-binance-smart-chain-e9e659cf6dad), it is a modified fork of Saddle, which in of itself was a modified fork of Curve:

&gt;Much of our StableSwap AMM implementation was based on Saddle’s Solidity contracts, which was originally based on Curve’s Vyper contracts. Saddle’s contracts were audited here. This does not mean that our contracts were audited, as they were slightly modified. Exercise caution.

Not to say those modifications can't make a difference, but I'm failing exactly how Nerve would add significantly more value to the quality/low slippage pools we already have. What exactly makes it stand out from some of the other quality stable pools?",2021-08-17 22:02:24
HelpfulDudeWhoHelps,"I’m going to tell you the truth however unpopular it might be. You don’t have enough money to go to market. To get in front of potential customers you need resources. Essentially skills and labor plus a budget for expenses like ad buys. 

You have some choices.

You can hire someone with the skills to do the labor or;
You can learn everything yourself and use your own labor.

Neither of these things can be done with $1,000. The learning curve for digital marketing is steep and takes years to master. (If anyone really masters it at all since it constantly changes). 

Now, there are plenty of people who will take your $1,000 and blow smoke up your ass about how they are going to rock your sales. They will take what they can for as long as they can and they know they won’t be able to move the needle. So they start looking for your replacement right away because it’s just a matter of time before you figure out you are getting screwed. (Called a churn and burn model). 

I’m willing to bet you invested a lot of money on your shop. Planers, sanders, joiners, table saws, clamps, dust collection, compressed air, on and on. 

Let’s do a mind experiment. 

Let’s say you said “I need to rip all this wood so I need a table saw but I only have $500. Would you be able to make that work? A commercial grade table saw costs thousands. You MIGHT be able to find a saw of some kind for your budget but it would be a pile of shit and a few months down the road, you will he right back where you started except $500 lighter in the wallet. (Like hiring that intern to handle social media). 

I’m not saying you can’t bootstrap this but you will need to spend your days on Facebook. You can’t make too many cutting boards if you are on Facebook all day. 

Businesses need capital. For facilities, equipment, management, labor for production, sales and marketing. 

I don’t know why so many people make investments in machinery and inventory and the like but see marketing as an afterthought. 

Until you find some money, you will piss away any budget you might have because you can’t get enough momentum to cross the threshold for ROI. 

Nobody will tell you this because they want your $1000. Think about it. You approach a social media dude and say “I want to do social media and I have $1000”  How many will push back and say “We can do some low level things for you but you likely won’t see an ROI.” And how many will say “Great idea sir! We can absolutely help you with that. Let me write it up and we can start Monday!”

So what to do? 

1. Invest in a marketing plan with someone who knows what they are doing and has a demonstrable track record of success.
2. Set your budget based on the cost of acquisition and lifetime value of your customer (I can help you figure this out in fifteen minutes)
3. Know what and when your break even point is on your marketing spend. And time to ROI.
4. Finance your marketing execution with metrics and milestones and stick with it. 
5. Test and test some more. As you execute and hater data your plan might change

Think of marketing like a giant flywheel. Your wheel is stationary right now. To get it moving will take a lot more energy (resources) now as opposed to when the flywheel has momentum. Then it will require much less energy.

You have it backwards. Your wheel won’t move.

stkw,"I've been trying to figure this out for the past 2 weeks as well. I think the best answer can be found here (though I haven't proved that this works yet): https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5231649-a-guide-to-curve-finance. Below is my breakdown of what it means.

There are two layers on Curve:

1. Depositing your ETH or stETH for crvSTETH.
1. Staking your crvSTETH in Curve Gauge or Yearn Vault.



**1. Depositing your ETH or stETH for crvSTETH.**  

Depositing your ETH or stETH for crvSTETH should give you 50% of your staking rewareds (50% because half of the pool is non-staked ETH and the other half is staked stETH). With APR on Lido being 5% right now, then 50% is 2.5%. 

The part I don't understand for this is how do we get the rewards for this. Normally, your stETH balance will gradually grow as it rebases everyday. In this case, does crvSTETH increase (I don't think so) or does the ETH to crvSTETH ratio change over time (currently at 1 Curve steth LP token = 1.019961 ETH, found here when you deposit: https://curve.fi/steth/deposit)



**2. Staking your crvSTETH in Curve Gauge or Yearn Vault.**  

Curve Gauge and Yearn vault should be similar in that they both require the staking of your crvSTETH. The biggest difference will probably be in fees, which I haven't dug into yet.

Curve Gauge is very straight forward. You'll earn steCRV and LDO. You withdraw the steCRV and LDO and you can do whatever you want with it. Without doing any additional staking, your crvSTETH should stay the same amount.

Yearn is essentially the same thing, except it will automatically trade steCRV and LDO and re-stake it for you and the result is that the amount of your crvSTETH will gradually increase. When you withdraw, you just withdraw a larger amount of crvSTETH.

So in conclusion, if everything is correct, you should make Yearn Vault APY + ~50% of Lido's ETH staking rewards.",2021-08-18 13:14:15

Sometimes car financing is very cheap.

However, that said, I would never finance a car. Home mortgage is fine (within reason) but a car is a risky asset both from a depreciation standpoint and from actual RISK. Someone hits your car and there goes a certain percentage of value you will never get back.

FX-Macrome,"A rule of thumb I like to stick by is being less than 1% of strategy frequency volume. For example, if I have a strategy trading hourly, my universe is restricted to those assets which have hourly volume of 100 \* my position size.

Only you know the urgency of your positions, e.g. do you mind having orders on the book in between intervals or do you need to be filled near instantly? Over a time horizon? etc. This will determine what execution strategy you use.

Examples for daily turnover might be over the VWAP curve (more traditional finance), DCA orders, iceberg orders (a special option in binance)... everyone here is focussed on finding alpha, but imo thats the easy part. Execution strategies make or breaks a trading strategy and is likely more important. If you come across any books, let me know.

mister_ghost,"So what's the appropriate response to this?

It seems like free money, and I've read here enough to recognize that MMT is a low status belief for losers, and that it doesn't have much acceptance among mainstream economists (i.e. you don't see many 'otherwise normal' economists saying it's a pretty good idea), but I don't have a clear understanding of what exactly is wrong with it. Part of that is down to the fact that it's hard to get a clear sense of what the hell MMT is - the difficulty in pinning it down is captured quite nicely [here](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2019/03/examining-mmt-model-in-detail.html). However if I'm being honest, any counterarguments to MMT that I read mostly go over my head.

&gt; Perhaps MMT is not model-based (""IS-LM with a near-vertical IS curve"") and not idea-based (""Functional Finance"") so that it can be guru-based.

But here we have a pretty accessible video trying to make the case for MMT, and I don't know exactly what the accessible response/debunking would be. My general understanding of the case against MMT is roughly that you can't eat money. Increasing the amount of money you have to spend on stuff doesn't magically make there be more stuff. But I do't know how well that transposes onto this video.

Things I could think of that might be flaws in the video include:

* The situation presented - that there are a bunch of problems and the government doesn't have enough money to fix them - is inaccurate. Either it isn't a plausible situation, or it doesn't represent the current situation well.

* Printing the money to repair a road would somehow not lead to the road being repaired.

* Taxes don't lower inflation, or at least they can't be used to arbitrarily lower the inflation caused by money printing.

* Taxes do lower inflation, but automatically tethering tax levels to inflation wouldn't work for some reason, or there are dramatic side effects to using taxes in this manner.

* There are downsides which are not mentioned in the video.

* The video doesn't actually represent a different way of doing things, it's just a different way of looking at how we currently do things.

So where does the video go off the rails? What is the anti-MMT elevator pitch?",2021-08-19 04:47:36

Right now it's nearly impossible to both be decentralized and follow the regulations required to be directly connected to banks. I think the biggest hurdle is getting people to understand how to use wallets and get funds from fiat into whatever network the apps are on. Once you've done that, a lot of the complexity can be abstracted away behind the scenes with simple interfaces.

[Make them defend these statements](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/ldrapz/z/gm9ww8k), this is what makes MMT different than standard macro. Do not let them get away with it.

IS curves are complicated and inaccessible I don't know if I could put that in an elevator pitch. /u/integralds used a [public finance](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/ldrapz/the_brutalist_housing_block_sticky_come_shoot_the/gmd8xg0?context=1) approach in that thread.

OpeningCultural287,"One place to start could be Angellist's Startup Salary calculator. See if you can find similar roles on there, it's transparent about salary and equity stakes in open startup roles. Easiest way for super early stage is to negotiate for a certain percentage of the company (0.5%, 0.25%, whatever is reasonable).

I worked in Finance at startups and we fielded questions all the time from candidates like what was your latest valuation, how many shares are outstanding, or what was the price per share of your latest round. If you can get figure out the price per share of the latest round, you can apply that same amount to the number of shares they're offering to come up with an implied value of the equity. Then you could also 10x that value but apply a 40% haircut for dilution and say 'if this takes off, this is what my equity could be worth in 8-10 years'

And finally before people jump on me...I know early stage equity is HIGHLY risky. The odds of a huge payoff are incredibly low. But these are some of thought exercises people all over startup land run in their head to assess the risk/reward tradeoff of taking a startup role. Because very few people go to a startup simply because it 'looks fun', most are there because 1) they're passionate about the problem trying to be solved and 2) the risk/reward curve",2021-08-20 03:02:32
Liwet_SJNC,"Whilst technology tends to be fairly winner take all, your own example of phones brings up the pretty obvious point that iOS and Android are currently competing in that space. As for manufacturers, there are... Several. Nokia might be dead, but it is hardly the only company in that space.

As for ETH dying... BTC and USDT are a lot worse than ETH in most ways, and yet are doing fine. First mover in the crypto space is huge. Eth can get by for a long time on just 'being ETH'

On trading... Well first off the S&amp;P is an index, this is more like being in an individual stock. If you're into finance at all you should know that 'diversify' is pretty basic advice.

And secondly, efficient markets random-walk. That's why cats can outperform professionals in picking stock, and why trading is generally just a good way to pay bonus fees. It might move you around on the risk curve a bit, too. But that's usually not a good thing for people who don't know what they're doing.

Crypto is *not* that efficient yet, though. That's why arbitrage is routinely possible in crypto, where it tends to be quite hard to find in the stock market.

glaci0us,"TRADITIONAL STOCK OWNERSHIP BENEFITS  
  
\-Ownership in the company  
  
\-Voting Rights  
  
\-Participation in economic growth and dividends of the company  
  
Fantastic right? Except large institutional players, venture capitalists and high net-worth individuals have advantages through asymmetric information and early access to investments through early stage funding/investing (VC) or taking part in IPOs. This means that transformational levels of returns are reserved only for the wealthy.  
  
WHY OWNING CRYPTOCURRENCY WILL GENERATE SUPERIOR RETURNS FOR MILLENNIALS AND GEN-Z  
  
Millennials and Gen-Z are operating on a 30-40 year investment time horizon and this time horizon allows these groups to be more risk-tolerant. The following outlines how investing in cryptocurrencies combines the best of growth, value and dividend investing to generate superior long term returns.  
  
Cryptographic protocols incentivize the appropriate use-cases by rewarding users with the native currency  
  
\^\^This allows protocols to be bootstrapped from a very small project to $Billions+ in market cap over a 3-10 year period. As of this writing there are 92 crypto currencies with $1B or larger market caps.  
  
\^\^This means protocols have less reliance on VC and early-stage funding  
  
  
  
Critically, less reliance on VC funding creates opportunity for higher returns as smaller investors can get in earlier  
  
\^\^The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency means the number of people with access to and the ability to buy crypto is exponentially larger than your typical purchase of a publicly traded stock which requires access to a broker, KYC (Know-Your-Customer) documentation, and a funded bank account.  
  
\^\^Occasionally protocols will “air-drop” the native currency meaning they will deposit tokens directly into a user’s wallet - typically those users who were early adopters  
  
\^\^\^\^With air-drops like the ones Audius and Uniswap did, there is an even larger incentive to get in at an earlier stage, front-loading the technology adoption curve and expediting the growth of the protocol  
  
  
  
The ability to see on-chain the number of “whale” wallets holding the currency reduces the risk of being dumped on by larger investors – every transaction is viewable on a public blockchain and the largest protocols make their vesting and lockup periods known pre-launch  
  
  
  
Tokens can be staked to earn rewards (interest)  
  
\^\^This simultaneously helps secure the network while generating a return which is often (much) larger than typical stock dividends and significantly larger than bank-offered rates, many of which hover in the .01% - .1% range currently in the US. Dividends are often in the 1.5%-2.5% range.  
  
  
  
Through DeFi (decentralized-finance) protocols, long term holders can earn yields far superior to typical bank-offered yields. The most well-known projects currently offer 5-10% APR’s but for the truly risk-loving it’s easy to find 100-300% APR’s  
  
  
  
\*\*TLDR\*\*  
  
Investing in crypto offers the upside potential similar to investing in seed or pre-seed funding stages while also being able to earn sizeable dividends/interest on investments from day one through staking and Defi. Anyone with a 30-40 year investment horizon, mainly Millennials and Gen-Z, now has better access to this asymmetric return profile through cryptocurrency investing. This paradigm shift opens the doors to transformational wealth creation in the long-run for retail investors.",2021-08-20 09:45:23

I took an abstract algebra course as part of my minor and really loved it, which is essentially the main reason why I am feeling brave enough to apply to math (non-applied) programs.

Always-_-Late,"Ok a lot of people here will tell you just don’t buy anything or the bare minimum. For me I set goals on what my net worth must be before I buys something “luxurious”. One caveat I’d like to ad to this is most of my luxury purchases arnt clothes or fancy dinners or anything that will instantly deprecate or be worth nothing. Here’s how it went for me

10k net worth - buy my mom a cheap $1,000 ca-r-
50k net worth - $2,000 vacation to Puerto Rico 
100k net worth - first luxury watch (it’s actually increased 30% in value since purchase)-
250k net worth - an affordable sports car sub 30k purchased at or near the bottom of its depreciation curve. My passive income pays 2x the car payment. NOT A NEW CAR-
500k - 5k family vacation -
1mil - new car same deal but under 80k-
5mil - pay off my moms house-
10mil - buy my dream home (under 800k)-
50mil - stop working on my income streams and let the systems I’ve established continue on their own.-

Keep in mind that I love cars and watches, these are both hobbies and I also know enough about both of them that I always purchase at or below market value and don’t finance anything that’s interest rate is higher than inflation and that I can’t pay for in cash. Some people may have a problem with this but I find it extremely motivational and keeps me from making small pointless purchases.

Fwiw using this method in the last 2 years I’ve increased my income from 3,000 gross a month to 20k gross a month, purchased my first rental property and set up an additional stream of income on top of my job and rental to help pay for these goals. Went from a net worth of 5k at 22 years old to 250k in at 24 , blessed my family and myself and have things to show for it, while living well below my means. There’s no point in living if you don’t enjoy the moment. I died and needed to be resuscitated earlier this year and learned that the hard way. But that’s another story.",2021-08-20 14:01:26

rememberdigg2004,"I don’t think you’ll get any arguments from anyone in this sub about new cars not being worthwhile, at least not financially. You are absolutely correct in the vast majority of cases.

It’s not due to VAT, though. It’s just down to depreciation - you lose a load of money in the first few years of new car ownership, and then less money the following years. So buying used you join that curve further down the line and thus “lose less”.

New cars offer massive profits to dealers because there is limited competition. Used cars, however, are in a bigger, more transparent, publicly driven market (autotrader et al) and thus offer reduced profits. As such, finance packages on used cars will be much higher interest rates to try and improve profits for dealers.

It’s not unusual to find 0% finance options on new cars (outside of COVID). An absolute no-brainer if you’re set on buying a new car. Whereas rates of 6.9% or even 8.9% are common on used cars. I have only ever seen 0% on used maybe once or twice prior to COVID from entry-level manufacturers - Ford and Volvo from memory.

decisions4me,"This sort of BS is so demeaning. It’s as if charts and trading is just used by people who look at lines going up and down the screen and think it’s some sort of casino and these people like the idea of a mouse click or two outperforming the work of 5 carpenters. And many traders fail at outperforming  the market long term anyway.  So trading is seen as a silly activity inexperienced stupid and lazy people partake in who don’t know what finance is about or how it effects the world and the economy. Trading is seen as exploitative since it is just about buying something in hopes that someone else will buy it for more, that very day. It’s seen as exploiting large hedge funds that rebalance investments based on actual logic. (Such as medical college applications for healthcare sector seasonality, or aluminum extraction and rubber effecting vehicles, or oil surveying company profits hinting at future oil supply) And many traders might not care at all what their actions do to the world around them, they like clicking their mice to make more money in the span of a few hours than 10 carpenters and farmers combined  over a whole day

The lines MEAN something. It’s a logical statement. It is a statement that as time goes buy, the lowest agreed to price is continuously higher, which signifies increased demand. Or lower. It’s just reflection of either multiple parties or a single party purchasing or selling. It could be based on numerous reasons. But it’s connected with actual resources. It’s connected with increased societal productivity. 

It’s like people forget about the logic underpinning the price of certain assets, and everything is just a line or a curve. It’s ridiculous. Technical analysis without logic is wrong. 

People interested in financial markets need to learn  about investment science, financial mathematics, system conceptual design, system architecting, system modeling, management of complex systems, systems engineering, applied analysis for model based systems engineering, 

People need to understand the anatomy of a dynamic system, and how solution and fitness landscapes work. And agent adaptation and density dependent solution spaces. 

First off, the definition of resources/money.

Money as in contracted, widely-recognized individualized localized symbolized units of quality/value resources backed by (Federal Reserve) confidence in the policy decisions of the federal government to raise the average quality of life.

Money is simply a representation of the recognized resources (in units of value) within society.

Businesses/Companies are institutions that exist primarily to capture value. This is done by acquiring and utilizing resources efficiently to maintain a continuous competitive advantage. This is essentially the practice of activity coordination for resource generation and capture through decision making, Or in other words. Business management is a decision making science related to coordination and resource and value generation and capture.

Ownership (cut into small pieces) of these institutions allows
for votes that provide a right to profits and also choice of leadership. 

finance is about the dedication/delegation/assignment of resources in society to incentivize certain activities towards their most profitable outcomes.

investors participate in a fair, orderly, and efficient market, and facilitate capital market formation.

Projecting lines without logic IS astrology. It’s ridiculous and demanding. 

Rising Demand in certain industries MEANS something, and it’s different if it’s intraday or weekly. 

This post is the equivalent of posting Astrology stuff in astronomy.

It’s not ethical, it’s demeaning, and it’s wrong. And it gives new people a wrong idea of what financial markets are about. 

Rapid re-allocation of resources helps society create more total resources. If Finance as an industry can produce 1% more resources  through efficient resource allocation. every four months, that is 36 times more growth in 80 years than without.

80 years is a long time, but 36X more assets developed is good. 

It’s why the Soviet Union fell. The Soviet Union delegated resources to projects and organizations every ten years. While they could achieve larger projects more quickly than the US, the USSR fell, eventually.

If the resources devoted to organizations and institutions can be rebalanced in half a year due to trends and changes, then that’s an optimization.

People need to stop portraying finance, and retail, as astrology and gambling.",2021-08-22 01:22:31

useless_weirdo,"Source: Early adopted ASC842 at my previous company and going through the adoption at my current company. Both adoptions while the company was private. 

Since you mentioned your company is private. You have two options - 1) pay a third party to develop a synthetic borrowing rate. 2) Use the risk free rate.  See ASC 842-20-30-3

1) This option was used at my previous company. Yes, it was more costly, but the benefit was we got a more accurate yield curve to represent our business. This also produced higher rates than the risk free rates which would help in our lease classification testing (PV of minimum lease payments &gt; or &lt; 90% of FV. Keep in mind there is no longer a bright line for this test but 90% from ASC 840 is still acceptable). Also remember, guidance states the rate is secured by the assets underlying the lease. 
2) using this option at my current company. Reason being - much smaller lease portfolio and made more sense for a company our size. Very easy to implement and no additional cost. Current leases are not at risk of being classified as a finance lease. 

Hope that helps. Surpassingly I found the KMPG guide to ASC842 the most helpful as a implementation guide. EY FRD for technical reference.",2021-08-22 06:19:03

RogerMexico,"US trade with China impacts inflation in two ways: (1) lower consumer goods prices and (2) trade imbalances driving down bond yields.

(1) **Lower Prices:** We all intuitively know that prices at Walmart are so low because almost all of their products are made in China. What consumers don't necessarily see is how much of the economy depends on Chinese goods. Healthcare services depend on Chinese manufactured consumables. Cars made in the US and Europe are dependent upon Chinese made parts that are assembled in western countries for tax reasons but still largely produced in Asia or Mexico. New and renovated homes depend on Chinese-made windows, doors, kitchen appliances, bathroom hardware and more. The list goes on...

(2) **Bond yields:** the US had a $338B trade in goods deficit with China over the past 12 months, the highest over any 12 month period in US history. This ""transitory"" supply-side shock is what has caused the recent spike in prices. However, the thing is that when a Chinese company sells a product in USD, they need to convert it to RMB to pay their workers and finance their capital expenditures and other expenses. When the entire economy is demanding RMB and selling USD, that drives down the cost of the dollar while increasing the cost of the RMB, which is bad for exports. To counteract this, the PBOC has bought US Treasury Bonds to the tune of $1.1T. This has kept long-dated treasury yields low and the yield curve flat. While you might be asking yourself, why don't lower rates mean higher inflation? The reason is because the steepness of the yield curve is what drives inflation as that means that banks are able to borrow at a lower rate and lend at a higher rate. If the yield curve is flat, lending is subdued and the economy doesn't overheat.

So what does this all mean? What this means is that we are entirely co-dependent on China. Any reversal of that dependency will turn what is currently talked about as a ""transitory"" effect to a long-term secular trend. And we have the political class of the US on both sides of the aisles talking about China as if it's Nazi Germany. Really doesn't bode well for our relations with our most crucial trading partner.",2021-08-22 09:23:04

Shatter_Hand,"I've written about this previously at length in threads so will provide a long (but fast reading) synopsis here:


If you know your way around DeFi, then you'll know the closest coins to fiat are stablecoins. The problem with stablecoins however, is that the interest rates attached to borrowing them are huge: 9%-15% is an average range on most platforms. 

This messes up an important dynamic, which is me never having to actually sell my crypto. You see, my crypto is either staked, or providing liquidity. That means I'm earning rewards on it at around let's say 6% APY. But if I borrow against it, the stablecoin APY is let's say 10%. That means I'm paying 4% APY. But what if this dynamic was reversed? Suddenly I'm net positive several points on my loan. That's what you can expect with CBDC's, because their interest rates should mirror the Central Bank rate. And if they don't, then I'll opt for a CBDC with the lowest rate, then swap it for my native currency. Central Bank CBDC's will all be forced to compete with one another. Our rate in the US is 0% currently. One reason we can afford to get away with this more so than other countries is because although the Treasury is printing cash like crazy, we're printing far less than  many other countries including our biggest allies. And not only this, but our currency is the world's reserve currency, and we issue bonds in that same currency. 

*But government's will never plug their CBDC's into decentralized finance,* you might hear people say. They'll have no choice. It's like what happened with Batman earlier this year: NFT's boomed and people started minting and selling their own Batman NFT's. These were selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars. DC Comics came out publicly condemning it, but there was nothing they could do, so some of these anonymous indie Batman artists were getting famous and continued raking in fortunes. Finally DC Comics did the only thing they could—join the blockchain. They released their own official NFT collection, captured the Batman market, sold them for a fortune, and the faux Batman NFT prices cratered. Same situation with CBDC's. If governments allow a competing government's currency (like China's digital Yuan) to metastasize and gain trust in a rapidly growing system, there will be trouble. China wouldn't have to call it the ""Digital Yuan"" either, they can call it USDxi or whatever the hell they want, and bundle them together to make 1 USD. 

Then there's the issue of consumer banks. Middle-men. I won't go through the process by which money is loaned into existence to chartered banks and their relationship to the Fed and Treasury, you'll have to learn that yourself. But if the US Treasury is plugging digital dollars directly into DeFi and directly to consumers, what purpose do banks actually serve anymore besides adding a step and transaction cost? None at all. Every retail business, car dealer, and debt collector in the country will have terminals or infrastructure that accepts USD CBDC's. I can also say the same fate awaits Mastercard and Visa. So suddenly there's enormous consolidation. Cashapp, Paypal, etcetera, saw the writing on the wall and realized they had no choice but to get ahead of the curve by integrating crypto into their platforms. Every major retailer is in the process of doing so, even if they don't admit to it. 

The final casualty will be stablecoins themselves, which are overpriced centralized custody solutions.

What's left is us, absorbing the entire financial structure, capturing the margins (profits) that once belonged to banks with our permissionless, censorship resistant, deflationary, hard money. 

This is all a few years out, but those that learn DeFi now, will be in an incredibly advantageous position. I also expect the friction (technical difficulty) of using crypto to halve by then too, which is important, because the only thing holding things back are ignorant people, which is how companies like Western Union, and Moneygram are still breathing, even if barely. 

There's more on volatility, and the flattening confidence curve of crypto globally, liquidity, and what to expect in a deflationary (credit crunch) versus inflationary global economy, but I'm going to call it quits for the night.",2021-08-22 17:59:24

Mengerite,"Great post. I've been holding and researching ALGO for a few months now, but I didn't realize it used that much less power even compared to ADA.

I highly recommend anyone interested in ALGO to listen to this [Lex Fridman episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/168-silvio-micali-cryptocurrency-blockchain-algorand/id1434243584?i=1000513007088) with Silvio Micali. Lex asks the questions that most of us have and Silvio gives great answers.

OP, could you talk a little bit more about how Algorand avoids centralization? Silvio talks about the centralization incentives for miners in PoW, but miners aren't validators. We learned in the block size wars that miners cannot dictate changes to the Bitcoin network. In PoS, tokens are votes. If you hold enough, you could vote to give yourself more tokens ([Yearn example](https://www.coindesk.com/yearn-finance-votes-to-inflate-yfi-token-supply-by-20)). By giving yourself more tokens, you get even more votes.

Silvio states often that he is making a big assumption: that if rich people could acquire a dominant share of the tokens that they wouldn't want to destroy their own value. The gaping hole in this logic is state actors, who could absolutely print fiat -&gt; buy ALGO -&gt; destroy the blockchain. Current ALGO market cap is $3 billion. Even considering the supply curve effect on price, the US could easily do this. As the market gap grows, this will admittedly become harder, but printing money is easy enough.

This is my last main concern (and I have it for all PoS chains including ETH 2.0).",2021-08-23 20:29:37

WeAllDeserveKindness,"I'm not qualified to give financial advice, so this isn't that.

You could put the majority of it into a stable pool, which can get you up to ~20% annually if you're willing to use Polygon. If you put 80-85% into that pool, (assuming Polygon doesn't collapse and Beefy doesn't rug,) you've earned back the principal in about a year. That frees up 15-20% for more riskier assets with potential to appreciate faster than USD; I would consider an automated blended strategy eg one of the ETF-like offerings that have come out recently including the [Future of Finance Fund](https://ndxfi.medium.com/are-you-a-futurist-cbd8d2fd5424), [BED Index](https://www.indexcoop.com/bed), or [Balanced Crypto Pie](https://medium.com/piedao/announcing-balanced-crypto-pie-bcp-btc-eth-and-defi-7a2423c5d94e). All of these options are 33% BTC and 33% ETH, with the last 33% allocated to a curated DeFi basket. Curve also has a tricrypto pool with USD as the last 33%, but you have a ton of USD exposure already.

You could also just buy ETH. Less options for yield, but in many people's eyes this is the safest play. Maybe consider some Uniswap v3 positions at multiple ranges to lock in USD profits (eg ETH-USDC at 3500-4000, 4000-4500, etc), but you'd have to track prices closely enough to exit those positions before volatility comes knocking. I would generally avoid pairing USD with crypto in unbounded liquidity pools (Uni v3 is not unbounded).

2.) Take the stETH to Curve finance, exchange half of it for ETH. Deposit into the Curve ETH/stETH liquidity pool.

3.) Take the Curve LP token over to Convex and swap it for a convex LP token, stake in the stETH/ETH pool for around 11 percent APY on top of your 5 percent from Lido. This allows you to yield farm with ETH without risking impermanent loss.

Numinae,"&gt;Does it matter? the fact is that there was no observable change. But the simple reason is that men and women did not compete much. The only real shift was a massive uptick in childcare, a female dominated profession. And other new positions being created for them.

ORLY? Women didn't just suddenly enter the labor force all at once - or integrate smoothly as many were skeptical a woman could do X job, it was a trickle that slowly eroded PP then it basically became a requirement for a household for both to work. Economics has a lag effect since the economy has ""inertia"" and people shuffle in and out. It can take *years* for a single effect to truly manifest. Also, the effect can be seen in just about every country where women's lib happened.

&amp;#x200B;

The side of the Supply and Demand equation you aren't seeing is that Women were ALREADY creating demand. They just weren't directly paying for goods but buying them using money their husband earned. As in, joint assets. So, demand for existing services and goods was basically the same. Obviously their freedom in purchasing decisions changed *what* they bought but their income but the amount of demand for ""All Stuff"" stayed the same. It existed before and didn't increase proportional to the increase in labor on the market. Therefore, demand stayed the same on a macro level for Goods but supply for labor producing those goods doubled. Simple supply and demand graph. The curve shifted. You're thinking about this like immigrants who add to the labor pool but also bring new demand that didn;t exist before. However, women were already here, already buying stuff. They didn't bring new demand. Maybe different demand but not new demand so, other than a shift in where those purchase were allocated, the total stayed static.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's another way to view the issue since you seem to have a problem grasping the concept. As women started entering the workforce while their husbands continued to earn money, they had much more spending money. The first overs got double the money but as more and more women started adding to the household income, eventually it became the norm. That means that EVERYONE started having double the money with the same production (this is a simplified view as technology changes productivity and other factors but, consider this an ""all things being equal and model the people as perfect sphere's with no air drag"" sort of thing). As always happens when everyone suddenly has double the item, it's value decreased; in this case, it's the value of the money and we got inflation. Obviously there was OPEC and other things happening during that time but inflation kicked in right around that time, even in countries where they weren't as dependent on petroleum. This manifested as wages not halving in number but inflation eroding the value of money faster than wages grew. Hence the lag in effect. Not to mention that it takes time for markets to re-price.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Union jobs used to be much more common and in fact represented a majority of total wages. Which is not surprising as they tended to pay more.

Most *jobs* in the US come from small to medium sized businesses. Most *taxes* come from big businesses At least they did until the goverment forced them to close while their big box competitors and Amazon were allowed to stay open so, we don't know the fallout yet but I've seen estimates ranging from 30%-60% of forcefully closed businesses not reopening. We're also seeing what happens when you pump in shit tons of extra money into the economy right now but the effects haven't even begun to manifest fully yet.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;our broke ass cannot afford a car either. You can just barely buy a beater once in a while.And most middle class people are living paycheck to paycheck, they cannot divert a significant fraction of their income towards buying a beater two rent periods away.

Lol, OK Zoomer. I don't know where you got the idea I by fucking jalopies; I was saying that for a teenager with an iota of motivation and ability, self respect and desire for independence, it's not hard to get a car. I love how you have to think I'm a broke ass loser like you to feel validated. Money is a means to an ends, not an ends in itself to anyone but a miser. That being said, Benz's are overpriced pieces of shit. Unless you want to spend $1k changing the oil. GMC luxury cars are nice though, as are heavy trucks but those are more for work. They're convenient as shit here though and I've had to fix a bunch of cars since I seem to drive trucks most of the time. Time to switch I think.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And most middle class people are living paycheck to paycheck, they cannot divert a significant fraction of their income towards buying a beater two rent periods away.

Then they're not middle class; they're people who have poor financial skills, keeping up with the Jones's, lack the ability to delay gratification or have had some horrible stroke of bad luck. My point wasn't ""oh, just buy a fucking car with money you don't have!"" it was ""Get a job, save your money, don't spend it on frivolous shit and within a relatively short period of time, you can afford at least a functional, if old car."" That means don't buy a fucking $1500 iPhone every time a new one comes out with a different color (better, don't buy apple shit at all) and for the love of god, don't finance it at usurious interest rates! Or a new PlayStation or *whatever* instant gratification trap tickles your vices. Better, start saving in anticipation of getting a car before you can get a license.

&gt;Land and property are tied to generational wealth. Once you have it that is that until you die. The issue is that while these things used to be passed down paternally they are now being hoarded because one generation got unreasonably lucky with having so many historical precedents broken during their childhoods. And now they are just not dying because of healthcare.

Well, sorry you can't wait for your parents to die to get their loot... I guess? God you're fucked up. Probably a commie too given your bullshit rationalizations on how hard work sucks, saving money up sucks, not having it dropped n your lap sucks, etc. This shitty attitude is pervasive amongst Millenials and Zoomers (shamed though I am to be one). Don't worry though, I'm sure someone will ""recognize"" you ""worth"" and make you the CEO of a company you played no part in building! Any day now! Just a matter of time! /s XDXDXD You know, god forbid you pull together what funds you can, save some if you have to and buy a fucking lawnmower or other basic tools, start ""debasing yourself"" with work you can get with that tool, invest your earnings and roll it into a small business and hire and expand as you can. Hell, you can Unionize your employees! I'm sure once you actually are in that position, you'll view them positively....

&gt;Nobody has made new land of source, save for China. But land can become newly available, valuable or developed and young people have been priced out of all of that.

Dude, the point is that the Earth is a finite resource but people are not. Land will only get scarcer. Do what the Boomers you like to blame all your (totally not behaviorally / work ethic derived) problems on did. Buy cheap land at the periphery of a growth zone and wait for growth in the area to reach it. Then you have equity. You can use leverage to develop the property and live there so instead of paying rent you get it as equity or use a *reasonable* loan to develop it and rent it yourself. You think things ho like Step1: Do nothing. Step 2: ???? Step 3: Profit. IRL there are A LOT of bullshit steps between where you are now and a goal. The problem is envious outsiders only see the fruits of labor without seeing all the work and bullshit it took to get there.

LoveLightLibations,"It's not design to convert automatically back to ETH. It literally can't because bETH, at it's core, is really just Staked ETH (stETH) from Lido Finance. Staking ETH, at present, is a one-way street. Once staked, it cannot be unstaked. 

However, because bETH is basically wrapped stETH, you can take advantage for the major benefit of Lido Finance. You can swap bETH back to stETH. At that point, you'll start to collect the staking rewards again. If you don't want staked ETH, you can then swap it back to ETH via Curve finance. Lido Finance is what makes it possible to ""unstake"" ETH via swaps. I suppose you've already figured this out though. 

Honestly, I'm really sorry to hear that you've had a bad experience with the platform. However, I feel as though your complaints are largely self-inflicted. You moved money in without understanding the total costs involved. Once in, you didn't leave your money in long enough to cover your costs. Now that you're out, it's clear you didn't understand the architecture of the system. 

Frankly speaking - it's a good system. Let's say you wanted to do the same thing via AAVE. On AAVE, you deposit ETH and earn 0.42%. You then borrow USDC against the ETH and pay 3.7%. Finally, you deposit the USDC you borrowed and earn 4.87%. You'd net 1.59% on top of your long ETH position. If you did the exact same thing via Anchor on Terra, **you'd net 30.36% plus you're still long on ETH**.",2021-08-24 22:28:07
RollyPollyGiraffe,"&gt;That’s fine as long as the class is curved at the end.

This individual does not curve.  


Even then, the expectation should be communicated upfront as it helps set the appropriate frame of reference for the assessment in question. For example, with your finance prof, I think that's fine since I imagine the following is true:  


1) They identified the exam was for Wharton MBAs, as you state  
2) They identified the intent to curve upfront, I assume  


At that point, the exam is a measure of, ""How well do you stack up to Wharton MBAs?"" which is a different headspace and assessment goal than just, ""Did you meet the necessary learning outcomes for this class?""",2021-08-25 03:20:09
FlatRateForms,"There is one thing I know my friend and it's 'what I know'.... and I understand finance. I'm not talking down to you, but I get tired of giving  a well formed, educated opinion about something that I've lived through more than once, only to get downvoted and told I'm a shill. THEN, I  have someone ask me privately or down the comment chain 'what I think'. 

I am 40 actually (good random guess) and started trading before the .COM bubble when I wasn't old enough to open the account (JTROS account at Ameritrade)... then survived  9/11, then the housing market collapse (that's what I did for a living). I adapted and made money because I was smart enough to look ahead and see what the picture looked like based on the limited pieces I had. Its what I do. Every business I am in stems from me thinking 'where can I fill a need that isn't a need yet' and get ahead of the curve. This is no different. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ive said for months... and will continue to say until this issue is dead that the federal government will not and cannot let this stock squeeze to $500k. Why? It would cripple every other market and index on the planet. Trillions in lost retirement funds would cause millions of families to suffer... all because some guy named DeepFuckingValue convinced a bunch of Reddit guys this would squeeze and they think they're owed their dues. 

They're not. 

This is a gamble. If you bought at $8.01, you could have sold and made 800%  profit in a few months... that's INSANE! Dont be greedy. Some of us actually sold in June and made a bunch and then bought back in later knowing what was going to happen... and while I hate to even assume what's gong on today will continue... it very well could and I very well would be made right a second time. 

What really bothers me is the sheer number of Redditors that have their lives mapped out based on $500k a share... people have quit their jobs, starting interviewing bankers... you understand how much this is going to suck for them when they can't retire because Reddit mismanaged expectations? It'll suck. Bad. Dont know what else to say man.

In closing let me reiterate... 

The technical aspects required are there for this to squeeze. For 100%. I just dont think the Fed will let it happen and that this will peak less than $1500 but over $500.",2021-08-25 04:21:29

“... Through $180 million liquidity mining incentives, the platform aims to attract projects like SushiSwap to build on their blockchain network. SushiSwap is among the most significant players in the DeFi ecosystem, alongside Aave and Curve Finance that are already building on Avalanche's blockchain. 

The smart contracts platform timed the re-release of its bridge for transferring Ethereum ERC-20 tokens to Avalanche ahead of the announcement of mining incentives.

The $600 million DeFi hack on Poly Network and the recent rug pull by the Luna Yield team on the Solana network have negatively impacted user's confidence in liquidity mining pools and DeFi projects. The re-release addresses this issue with enhanced security. 

The latest addition to Avalanche's Rush program, SushiSwap, allows the Avalanche foundation and the project to allocate nearly $7.5 million worth of AVAX and SUSHI tokens to the mining incentives over the next 90 days. 

Interestingly, liquidity mining incentives have become critical when DeFi users have lost funds to rug pulls. Committing their assets to a protocol's liquidity mining pool and earning a reward in return is likely to attract new users to Avalanche.”",2021-08-25 14:41:11

ok_i_am_that_guy,"In a zero-sum game, no matter how much you educate people, there will always be people loosing money.  


For the government, more people being allowed to trade, by lower entry barrier, would mean more STT and other taxes. And yet, there are those doors, that are kept to stop people from trading.  


No one can know if someone can make money or not. But one thing is clear that someone not having enough capital to take deliveries, will most probably be in bad shape, if they loose even a few bets.  


There's a reason why very few long/medium term investors ever jump from the edge of a building, while a lot of traders do.  


There can be exceptions (people with exceptional knowledge and experience, but not much capital), but in general, entry barriers are good at stopping the people who typically fall in the first stage of the dunning-cruger curve.  


I have seen people of my age (25-30) jumping at option/future trading the moment they have enough money to pay for the margin (this was 4-5 years ago, when margins were even lesser). They used to loose badly, and later used to complain that their broker cheated by squaring off their positions (due to lack of margin). Most of these people had just seen some YouTube videos possibly with titles ""Strategy to make fixed monthly income from stock market"" (aka. Options selling)

No one should be trading with all their money, because it's dangerous. We can argue about their right to choice, but then what about drugs? When any government or social institution sees people making really bad choices, they have to add some entry barriers. So that people don't do it in a hurry. Specially, and most importantly, people who don't really have a lot of money. (I know this is a grey area, and it's constantly misused in many other areas)  


And obviously, there are so many places where I hate it as well. I am not allowed to invest in Indian pre-IPO via platforms like Equityzen, unless I am an HNI (or the entry was even higher than HNI limit, not sure). I wanted to invest in so many companies - Zomato, Ola, PayTm, etc, but I couldn't. And the opportunity costs are huge. I find it unfair as well. I have decent (not a lot) knowledge of businesses, and I have a well diversified portfolio. And I was certainly not going to put all my life's savings in a high-risk, illiquid asset. They also had a provision for ""accredited investors"". But I couldn't make into that being a software engineer, no matter my personal investment experience. (had been managing my relative's tiny MF portfolios, even before getting my own first salary. I know, not much to brag about, it was mostly because ""I was good with computers"", and things had started to move online. :D )  


But then, it's also true that if it's allowed, a lot of people will be selling these to unsuspecting people, without telling them the risks &amp; illiquid nature of these instruments. It can happen to an HNI as well, but with few exceptions:  
1. An HNI would generally have a better understanding of finance, or will already have access to CA, CFA, accountants, handling their money.

2. Even if they end up getting their money stuck, they are more probable to have more money, or other income sources, with which they can continue their lives, feed/educate/marry their sons/daughters, and other things. Same can't be said for a primary school teacher, or some other person who ends up putting a lot of money into such investments.

One of my juniors, in a previous job had invested around $1000 dollars in a US-based pre-IPO platform with $100 minimum ticket size, not knowing how illiquid they are. He spent these $1000 (around Rs. 1.5 L ?) out of his total savings of 2 lacs. He happened to have a small emergency later, and we had to jump in to help him. That's when he told all this.  


In an ideal world, everyone would be capable to take sound decisions, and being a strong supporter of individual freedom, it pains me to say this, but it's better to keep people with lesser investible money away from such high risk games.",2021-08-26 23:10:02
Anastariea,"tl;dr the first year is since it's really easy, other years specially 3rd and 4th will fuck you.

The old student union president was well connected, like really well connected. He would secure like 5 or 6 parties a semster with big ones ones like Amr diab and Tamer Hosney and some American singers.

Then there's the new SU head who barely managed to secure any decent one. iirc we only had two before the Uni closed due to covid. 

Or at least that's what the SU representatives told me, I don't particularly care

Anyway, the first year in Uni (prep) is easy, so you would have time to party (if there is still parties kek)  and enjoy your time while still getting high grades, sort of the same for the 2nd year (or first after prep)  too though you will have to put a solid amount of effort, just not the ""no social life for high grades"" type.

Then comes the real assholes, year 3 and 4 (2nd and 3rd after prep) where you pick a specialization/major in year 3 and oh boy, the same effort that got you an A in 2nd year will get you a C in third, specially in a major like Finance and accounting.

FlacidPasta,"Unpopular fact:

The ONRRP was never used as collateral for short positions. The primary participants are mostly Money Market Mutual Funds that banks use to get a 5 basis point return on cash sweep accounts. The Fed TGA $1Tn transfer in March aligns perfectly with the sudden spike in ONRRP activity. The banks don't want this excess cash liability so they send it back to the Fed in a riskless overnight swap for placeholder collateral.

This relieves the pressure on the short end of the yield curve, eliminates the liability in the bank's deposits, allows the Fed to pay themselves 5 basis points to supplant the already excessive liquidity risk-free overnight, and puts a hard floor on the Fed policy rate (0% - 0.25%), otherwise known as the effective Fed Funds Rate.

The filing above does not mention ""REVERSE repo"" anywhere. GCF (General Collateral Financing) repo is the repackaging of general collateral (unknown types of both corporate and government bonds of unknown maturities) lent out for CASH. The ONRRP is specifically 3-month Treasury Bills lent out to MMMFs with a strict 60 day weighted-average maturity (WAM) for COLLATERAL. These two are NOT the same. In fact, they're essentially POLAR OPPOSITES.

This is the biggest piece of misinformation floating around across all social media that refuses to get rectified and makes us all look bad.

SpicyGoop,"I know what you’re saying but think of like Loki. I’m thinking more godlike than Godlike you see?

After a certain amount of time your physical perfection would allow you to mold the world around you as you please, through finance, persuasion, or political gain, whatever. There is little any mortal human could do to stop you, and that at least puts you into minor god range. 

I feel that the “far outside the capabilities” bit is also satisfied by the immortality. Being able to accumulate the totality of all the information around you and make the optimal choice for a desired outcome. Surely, with infinite lifetimes you could figure out how to extend your life artificially. Once that happens it becomes an exponential curve of gathering information, and increased gathering time. You are also now introducing more information as you push further into the future, allowing you to bring more and more advanced technology backwards. 

The longer you live, the more time you have to figure out how to live longer. I am sorry about that sentence. 

Sure, it takes a really really really long time, but it makes you conditionally omnipotent within a small area. 

I mean shit there are some gods that live forever but they don’t have any powers and they just tell stories.

alternativelytoo,"I just scraped together enough of a combination of GSCEs, CSEs and O levels to take A levels.  I wasn’t motivated and flunked them. 

I began a HND on Comp Sci and dropped out half way through the first year because I wasn’t motivated (very long story involving depression, homelessness and childhood trauma).

Got motivated.  Went back to college to do a coupon of A levels in a year - got an A in one of them.

Began a degree ( had to self finance) in a European language I’d never spoken a word of.  Got a 2:1.

Worked in advertising for 2 years - hated it.  

Began IT from scratch by reading 3 books in a small bedroom for three months.  Enjoyed a 20 year career at the cutting edge of IT, got married, raised a family and (whilst I still have a mortgage) have a lovely home in London.

Lost my job the day lockdown began and now I’m almost bankrupt.

So, again, retraining in cutting edge tech stuff with online courses building on my experience and started a new company with people I’ve met in the business.

Life is tough kiddo but if you want to succeed then they key is being motivated, hardworking and fearlessly determined in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles.

That way you can achieve far more than you ever expected and if it doesn’t work out first time, change, adapt and keep going.

Nothing ever happened by doing nothing. Life will always throw curve-balls (excuse the Americanism).

If you want it - go get it.

When you pass,  DM me if you’re not too busy smiling and reviewing a pile of job offers.  If I make and you do then I’d be interested to see if we can work together.

If you want a screen that shows things how they were intended to be viewed you need to put in extra work. Most people don't put in that work and don't know. So everything that's properly set up looks ""flat"".

If you were to tell people that how they view something is ""wrong"" they get mad that you tell them what they should be doing, even though they've been subconsciously taught the ""wrong"" way is right. The difference is simply that one was done without them noticing.

The reason is simple: TVs in big stores were sold under bright artificial lighting and big stores unpack the TV and just leave as is. If your TV is brighter and more colourful people deem it as having a better picture and it gets sold.

marco-sharko,"I imagine it's a perfect storm of increased demand and decreased supply. This will inevitably move the price point upwards along the demand curve. Most comments seem to think its all about semi conductor shortages, but I think its about much more that that. 

**Relevant factors;**

1. **Fewer people qualifying for credit on new cars:** 93.3% of new cars bought privately are purchased on finance ([https://www.fla.org.uk/research/motor-finance/](https://www.fla.org.uk/research/motor-finance/)). A lot of people went on furlough in recent years, or had income reductions / loss of earnings due to the pandemic. A high percentage of people with previous car loans have missed payments or had some form of forbearance on their loan payments. Lenders vary their criteria, but many will not treat furlough payments as income (will see them as benefits) and will see missed payments on previous loans as a red flag. This means that fewer people will now qualify for finance for a new car. If you really need a replacement car, this means a large percentage of those people that would ordinarily buy a new car on finance will now have to enter the market for second hand cars, which will drive up demand and hence prices.
2. **Production problems crimping supply:** the chip shortages are well known and publicised, but there are other reasons why producers have had to scale back their numbers. Labour shortages or shift curtailments due to the pandemic are one serious problem that led to reductions in output. Even with full staff on a shift, social distancing and other measures creates huge inefficiencies that mean lower output. Factories were especially hard hit by labour shortages due to notifications. The lower salary of factory workers also makes the limits of furlough (salary cap at £2.5k per month) more attractive, compared to bankers (for example). 
3. **Decreased demand for new cars:** Related to point 1, if there are fewer qualifying buyers for new cars, there is less demand for new cars, so car makers will scale back output by cancelling overtime. 
4. **Recent history in UK was a glut of second hand cars:** We may not have realised it but in the last 10 years, the price of second hand cars was unusually low. The reason for this was the strong growth in consumer credit for new cars at very low interest rates. This created a market where many customer that would normally buy second hand cars realised that they could get a new car for about £250 a month, so they went with new instead of second hand. This had a double impact: it meant that there were fewer buyers for 2nd hand cars (because a higher percentage than usual opted for new) AND it meant that there was a higher than usual number of 36 month old lease disposals hitting the second hand market. 
5. **Reduction in the supply of lease disposals:** related to the point above, the reduction in output of new cars means a reduction of cars coming into the 2nd hand market. The pipeline is crimped. It's not just the 36 month old lease disposals, there is also a significant 'nearly new' 2nd hand market, at less than 12 months old. 
6. **Reduction in the supply of 2nd hand from the rental sector:**  traditionally a busy route for auto makers to launder excess stock into the 2nd hand market, nearly new rental cars (esp from the volume makers like Ford) often ended up in the 2nd hand market at between 6-18 months old. In the past, these cars would sell at really discounted rates, typically 40% off retail at only 12 months old. Most people would not know that they were buying ex rentals, as the only listed owner would be a finance company, so they are indistinguishable from business cars.  The pandemic basically put a stop to travel, so the usual quote of ex-rentals is not hitting the market, which further pushes up prices. 
7. **Reduction in demand from fleets:** many businesses that were frequent buyers of lease cars for their staff simply stopped leasing during the pandemic as they looked to cut costs that were not necessary. No in person meetings means no need for travel, so no need to lease cars. Once they're not leasing, this means that there is less disposal into the 2nd hand market, less supply means higher prices.",2021-08-27 18:32:34
ha1t_i_am_reptar,"So I was guilty of this a few weeks back. I chalked it up to a learning curve for me, and I took down a post that was considered easily answerable.

C-Jen,"Thanks, I've also lived a decade in the UK and now I'm back in the US.

I was part of a US based business that handled travel, so I made contact with clients in China and helped them out in their own language.

If you do decide to reside in China, you'll need to be pragmatic. First, I wouldn't go while COVID is still a travel issue - you'll need to quarantine at the port of entry, and then even if travel within China, you'll need to quarantine again after each leg.

Once you are able to go to China, make sure you understand what your visa category rules and requirements are. I'd recommend that you take a shorter trip first to become familiar with different areas (if you're talking metropolises, then there's generally Beijing and the northeast as a certain way of life, then Shanghai and the Yangzi cities as another way, then inland metropolises like Chengdu, Chongqing, maybe Xi'An further north, and then Guangzhou/Shenzhen/Zhuhai as the Pearl River three cities.

If you don't speak the language, you'll be at a big disadvantage, so you'll need to either plan to travel with somebody who does, or you can take language classes before you go (probably making use of pandemic time).

China's banking and finance systems are not fully integrated with the developed world's, so you wouldn't necessarily be able to just pack a Visa/Mastercard and expect to be able to pay for everything. Check with your local country's banks to see if they have banking treaties with any of China's main banks (Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China, China Communications Bank) and whether you can easily convert your home currency into Chinese currency.

Set up a VPN so that you can access foreign websites outside of the Chinese system ahead of time. Once you get inside the Chinese internet ecosystem, it's hard to get out without one. You'll need to familiarize yourself with the native Chinese apps that replace standard Android/iPhone apps, like Baidu for search and mapping, Didi for Uber, Dazhongdianpin for Yelp like reviews, and so forth.

If you just want to play tourist and don't need to work to support yourself over a long time, then that may be enough. To actually reside there and work there, you really should not even consider this unless you have the backing of a foreign company to help you.

The foreign company can negotiate on your behalf for whatever contract or transactional disputes come up (and the Chinese professional markets tend to be quite cutthroat, so you will encounter people trying to make a fast buck off of your unfamiliarity). In most cities, if you start to live in a non-hotel lodging, you will be expected to notify the local urban officials so they can log your place of residence. (Chinese citizens themselves are subject to a per-city *hukou* residence system which determines their medical, academic, and employment authorizations.)

Be prepared for air quality and water quality that is lower than developed nations (understandably since China is still a developing nation) and a steep learning curve for things like public transport, local groceries, and places to shop for domestic things.

I myself was well compensated for my work there, as my company recognized that I was doing a lot of hard work far from my permanent home. I was also living and working with my fiancee, so I had somebody who loved me and cared about my well being (as well as insulating me against some of the more predatory types of local relationships that you sometimes hear about expats getting drawn into). I do speak and read Chinese, but not fluently (though well enough to negotiate in my field of specialty). I was able to meet with family inside China and back in the US, but it was a tricky balance. I would come back to US friends who had progressed out of their usual social circles and relationships when I'd left them.

Work was hard - since the downside of being sent over by a western organization meant that I was expected to be available to talk with the leadership at odd hours due to the time difference. 

If I were offered another opportunity to go, I would probably take it - but I would again need proper logistical and organizational support. About eight years ago I almost went over, trying to build contacts my own way (""with a briefcase and my business cards and nothing else"") but I have no idea how that would have turned out. I might have been able to use the local cities' US Chambers of Commerce to build my trade networks, but I could just as easily have been scammed, cheated, or wasted my entire time fruitlessly seeking a profitable venture. There are numerous stories even on Reddit of expats who went to China with one particular idea in mind, and found that the reality was a significant drop from expectations, and they're bitter and angry and used up by it all.

China's not a land of open riches and easy opportunity. It's already supporting a massive population and competition among fellow Chinese is cutthroat even as they start their education. If you're going in search of adventure, make sure you define what sort of time frame you're going to be there, and make sure to have an exit strategy.

That being said, the best trips I've ever taken have been inside China. And from about 2016 to 2018 I did a number of trips (Hainan/Sanya, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Xi'An, and that's not counting cities I visited for business meetings) that I still get misty over when I view the photos.

Final note: China is not a nation of immigrants, and its system is not set up with the same regard for welcoming outsiders that you might see in the Americas or parts of Europe, so you'll need to be willing to potentially be seen as an outsider for the duration of your stay there. If you're smart about it, you can find a niche as ""here's a foreign expert"" or ""here's a foreign traveler having the time of his life"", but it will take effort and some time of adjustment.

My first weekend in China involved several speaking engagements and schedule changes, as well as some high-pressure negotiations back and forth. I look Chinese and I can speak it, but by Sunday evening, I was thoroughly culture shocked and disoriented, and on the verge of tears - even in the comfortable luxury of my international hotel room. I suspect I would not have survived without the grounding presence of my fiancee with me.",2021-08-28 04:35:30
ErnestMorrow,"Some other amazing stuff in that book:

(from the introduction)

My heresy is a different, fractal kind of
statistical relationship, a “long memory.” This is a
delicate point to which a full chapter will be
devoted later. For the moment, think about it by
observing that different kinds of price series
exhibit different degrees of memory. Some exhibit
strong memory. Others have weak memory. Why
this should be is not certain; but one can speculate. What a company does today—a merger, a spin-off,
a critical product launch—shapes what the
company will look like a decade hence; in the
same way, its stock-price movements today will
influence movements tomorrow.

Others suggest that the market may take a long time to absorb and
fully price information. When confronted by bad
news, some quick-triggered investors react
immediately while others, with different financial
goals and longer time-horizons, may not react for
another month or year. Whatever the explanation,
we can confirm the phenomenon exists—and it
contradicts the random-walk model.
Second, contrary to orthodoxy, price changes
are very far from following the bell curve. If they
did, you should be able to run any market’s price
records through a computer, analyze the changes,
and watch them fall into the approximate
“normality” assumed by Bachelier’s random walk.
They should cluster about the mean, or average, of
no change. In fact, the bell curve fits reality very
poorly. From 1916 to 2003, the daily index
movements of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
do not spread out on graph paper like a simple bell
curve. The far edges flare too high: too many big
changes. Theory suggests that over that time, there
should be fifty-eight days when the Dow moved
more than 3.4 percent; in fact, there were 1,001. Theory predicts six days of index swings beyond
4.5 percent; in fact, there were 366. And index
swings of more than 7 percent should come once
every 300,000 years; in fact, the twentieth century
saw forty-eight such days. Truly, a calamitous era
that insists on flaunting all predictions. Or,
perhaps, our assumptions are wrong. 

**Rule V. Market time is relative.** 


There is what one may call a relativity of time
in financial markets. Early on, but mostly when
developing the multifractal model, I came to think
of markets as operating on their own “trading
time”—quite distinct from the linear “clock time”
in which we normally think. This trading time
speeds up the clock in periods of high volatility,
and slows it down in periods of stability.
Mathematically, I can write an equation showing
how one time frame relates to the other and use it
to generate the same kind of jagged price series
that we observe in real life. This is how the
successful forgery shown among the previous
charts was made. It is almost as if dealing rooms
need, besides the standard row of wallclocks
showing the time in Tokyo, London, and New
York, a fourth clock showing “Greenwich Market
Time.”

This last point highlights an important subtext of
this book: Market professionals know far more
than they even realize. Professional traders often
speak of a “fast” market or a “slow” one,
depending on how they judge the volatility at that
moment. They would quickly recognize, and
affirm, the concept of trading time. Likewise, a bit
of market folk-wisdom holds that all charts look
alike: Without the identifying legends, one cannot
tell if a price chart covers eighteen minutes,
eighteen months, or eighteen years. This will be
expressed by saying that markets scale. Even the
financial press scales: There are annual reviews,
quarterly bulletins, monthly newsletters, weekly
magazines, daily newspapers, and tick-by-tick
electronic newswires and Internet services.
Market folklore and anecdote, of course, cannot
confirm the multifractal model; only rigorous
statistical analysis can do that. But the folklore
does signal that the model is on the right track.

The multifractal model also has many
implications for practical finance. As indicated,
portfolio theory needs rethinking; options need revaluing; trading strategies need review. A small
example: “stop-loss” orders are imperfect, to put it
mildly. Many investors or traders leave
instructions to close a position when a price hits a
particular target. But as many have learned to their
grief, when prices are really flying, they typically
whiz past the target so fast that even the most
attentive broker cannot execute the “sell” orders
fast enough. Result: Greater losses, or smaller
profit, than the investor intended. Another
example: the mathematics of this model offers
some potentially new yardsticks to measure
volatility and risk. Instead of the standard
deviations and “betas” of conventional finance,
one can imagine new scales based on two new
variables to be described later in this book: the H
exponent of price dependence, and the α parameter
characterizing volatility. A few fund managers
have experimented with these concepts. They often
call it chaos theory—though strictly speaking, that
is marketing language riding on the coattails of a
popular scientific trend. In reality, the mathematics
is still young, the research barely begun, and reliable applications still distant.

So caveat emptor: This book will not make you
rich. Bookseller: Do not put it on the same shelf
with the “How to Make a Million in the Market”
volumes. If it fits any genre, it is that of popular
science. It explains a new, and important, way of
looking at the world—in this case, the financial
world. It attempts to do so using common English,
with as few formulae and as little mathematical
jargon as possible—or at least, with no jargon
unexplained. That is because I aim to stimulate
broader debate about financial-market modeling. It
is a debate that has, hitherto, been confined to the
rarefied circles of economics-minded
mathematicians, or of mathematically inclined
economists. The underlying mathematics is,
frankly, forbidding—the primary reason why,
when I first began publishing in the 1960s and
1970s, few mainstream economists were inclined
to listen. But the extraordinary tumult and noise of
this fin de siècle market turmoil are opening the
ears of many who previously affected deafness.

Research in this field has far to go. It took more than sixty years after Bachelier’s thesis for
economists to formulate properly the Efficient
Market Hypothesis, and another decade beyond
that for their work to find valuable applications in
the real world of zerocoupons and call options. With fractals, we are only a few short decades
from the origin. But they already illumine some
profound truths of finance and economics. Chief
among these is the paramount importance of risk. We have been mis-measuring risk.
Greater knowledge of a danger permits greater
safety. For centuries, shipbuilders have put care
into the design of their hulls and sails. They know
that, in most cases, the sea is moderate. But they
also know that typhoons arise and hurricanes
happen. They design not just for the 95 percent of
sailing days when the weather is clement, but also
for the other 5 percent, when storms blow and their
skill is tested. The financiers and investors of the
world are, at the moment, like mariners who heed
no weather warnings. This book is such a warning.",2021-08-28 08:57:36
ErnestMorrow,"**But Does It Work?**

Such is the weight of evidence against the
assumptions in the standard model that it is no longer reasonable to ignore entirely. Indeed, forty
years after I started a battle on the subject, most
economists now acknowledge that prices do not
follow the bell curve, and do not move
independently. But for many, after acknowledging
those points, their next comment is: So what?
Independence and normality are, they argue, just
assumptions that help simplify the math of modern
financial theory. What matters are the results. Do
the standard models correctly predict how the
market behaves overall? Can an investor use
Modern Portfolio Theory to build a safe,
profitable investment strategy? Will the Capital
Asset Pricing Model help a financial analyst, or a
corporate finance officer, make the right decision?
If so, then stop arguing about it. This is the so-
called positivist argument, first advanced by
University of Chicago economist Milton Friedman.

Alas, by that measure, too, the standard tools of
financial theory often fail. Economics is a faddish
discipline. In the 1970s, when the CAPM and
Black-Scholes ideas were spreading, the way to
get ahead in economics was to find evidence that they were right. So, evidence was found and
dissent ignored. But in the 1980s, a correction set
in that has continued to this day. Young economists
see Sharpe and his generation as old boys, to be
challenged. Bit by bit, new evidence has been
emerging in academic journals and Wall Street
newsletters that reality is more complicated than
the old-style religion allows.

Recall that, under CAPM, the return an investor
should expect to receive from a stock is just the T-
bill rate, plus some proportion of the stock-
market’s overall performance; that proportion is
the crucial “beta” value, which varies from stock
to stock. Under the orthodox theory, nothing else
should be going on. No need to study the
fundamentals of the company in question. No need
to pump friends on the company’s board for inside
information. Just calculate the beta, check the T-
bill rate in the newspaper, and make a broad
economic forecast about how the stock market
overall will do. End of story.

In fact, the story is a lot longer than that. A string
of what economists euphemistically call “anomalies” have been found—effects that do not
fit or that contradict CAPM:


Anomaly 1: The P/E Efect.
Financial analysts often compare a
stock price to other numbers to help
decide whether it is expensive or
cheap. The most common tool is the
price/earnings ratio: the stock price
divided by the company’s per-share
earnings. Orthodox theory calls that
a waste of time: Only beta, the
degree to which a stock does or
does not move with the rest of the
market, should matter to its price.
P/E should be meaningless. In fact,
several studies have found, stocks
with high P/E ratios tend to perform
worse than stocks with low ratios.
That is, of course, just common
sense: A stock for which you
overpay from the start is less likely
to give you a profit.

Anomaly 2: The Small-Firm-in-
January Efect. Shortly after the
P/E factor was studied, economists
discovered the “January effect”
mentioned earlier: a clear tendency
of the market to rally every January.
Then, a “small-firm effect” was
discovered: Portfolios of small-
company stocks outperformed large
companies by 4.3 percent,
economists found. And, further
study found, a “small-firm-in-
January” effect combining the two
phenomena was even more
pronounced than either on its own.
Again, the orthodox financial theory
wishes these effects away. When a
statistician looks for correlations
between prices and various factors
that could be affecting them, only
the stock-market beta should pop
out as having any importance whatsoever.

Anomaly 3: The Market-to-Book
Efect. Another common financial
ratio used by stock-pickers is
market-to-book: That is, divide the
stock price by the per-share value
that the company’s accountants
report in the financial reports, or
“book.” Surprise: Companies with
low ratios—that is, those that the
stock market values less than does
the company’s accountant—
perform better over time than
companies with high ratios. Of
course, this is nothing more than the
old Wall Street mantra, buy low,
sell high. And again, by the
standard theories, it should not
work.

Many more such anomalies have been reported
in economics journals. But this kind of research came to fruition in an especially influential 1992
paper by Fama and French. They tried to create the
economic equivalent of a double-blind drug trial,
devising tests and controls to prevent any
unintended bias fromslipping into the results. They
looked at the price/earnings effect and the
market/book effect—and found those two factors
alone could account for most of what differentiated
the profitability of one stock from another. Beta
was redundant. It was, Fama and French asserted,
“a shot straight at the heart of the (CAPM) model.”
That phrase has earned their work a shorthand title
among other economists: the beta-is-dead paper.

So much for CAPM. As for Black-Scholes, the
original options-pricing formula is now widely
accepted to be imprecise at best, and misleading at
worst. Finally, an especially lively pastime for
economists these days is to try poking holes in the
grand unified theory of modern finance, the
Efficient Markets Hypothesis that markets are
rational, prices reflect all available information,
and you cannot beat the market. In fact, it appears,
sometimes you can. By 1989, Peter Lynch, one of the most successful investment managers, had
guided Fidelity’s Magellan Fund to beat the market
index in eleven out of thirteen years. The odds of
Lynch accomplishing that by dumb luck, as the
Bachelier model would have it, are slim but not
impossible: About one chance out of 105,
according to one study. But it was not just the
frequency of success that was striking about
Magellan; its magnitude was more unusual. The
fund’s average annual return for the entire period
was 28 percent, compared to 17.5 percent for the
Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index. And for its first
seven years—when it was still a small fund, too
small for any detractors to argue that its size alone
gave it a competitive edge in the marketplace—
Magellan beat the market by an average 25 percent
a year. The odds of that occurring by dumb luck
are less than one in 10,000—“far beyond the
bounds of luck in an efficient market,” concluded
the study’s author, Alan J. Marcus, a Boston
College finance professor.",2021-08-28 09:46:25
ErnestMorrow,"**The Persistence of Error**

Then why, with so much evidence against the
orthodox financial models, do most economists
still teach them, and why do many financiers honor
them? If this were astronomy, the argument would
have ended long ago. Imagine observatories
suddenly finding a new planet where, the standard
theory says, none should be. And then another, and
another and another. Astronomers, after checking
their instruments, would not ignore the data; they
would question their understanding of celestial
mechanics and a new and fruitful episode in
astronomy would dawn. But it does not work that
way in economics, even though the equivalent of
countless new planetary sightings have been
recorded. In part, the profession’s reaction reflects
the nature of finance and statistics; there are few
open-andshut cases when an economist meets a
computer database. Yes, some of the individual
arguments against the standard model are by now
irrefutable: Prices are, indeed, abnormal and dependent. Some other arguments, such as “beta is
dead,” are strong but not bulletproof; millions of
words have gone, in the academic press, to
critique Fama and French’s paper.

And the high priests of modern financial theory
keep moving the target. As each anomaly is
reported, a “fix” is made to accommodate it. When
CAPM first came under attack, academic
economists devised a broader model, called
Arbitrage Pricing Theory. Rather than work with
just one factor, beta, APT incorporates as many
factors as desired: a beta for the market/book
effect, a beta for the price/earnings effect, a beta
for the state of the economy, and a beta for any
other factor that could conceivably affect stock
prices. Likewise, when it became clear that
volatility really does cluster and vary over time
rather than stay fixed as the standard model
expects, economists devised some new
mathematical tools to tweak the model. Those
tools, part of a statistical family called GARCH (a
name only a statistician could love), are now
widely used in currency and options markets.

But such ad hoc fixes are medieval. They work
around, rather than build from and explain, the
contradictory evidence. They are akin to the
countless adjustments that defenders of the old
Ptolemaic cosmology made to accommodate pesky
new astronomical observations. Repeatedly, the
defenders added new features to their ancient
model. They began with planetary “cycles,” then
corrected for the cycles’ inadequacies by adding
“epicycles.” When these proved inadequate, yet
another fix moved the center of the cycles away
fromthe center of the system. In the end, they could
fit all of the anomalous data well enough. As more
data arrived, new fixes could have been added to
“improve” the theory. They satisfied their early
customers, astrologers. But could they lead to
space flight? It took the combined efforts of Brahe,
Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler to devise a
simpler model, of a sun-centered system with
elliptical planetary orbits. The long and well-
documented history of successful sciences includes
many such examples of pyramids of fixes—but
they are viewed as stopgaps.

So again, why does the old order continue?
Habit and convenience. The math is, at bottom,
easy and can be made to look impressive,
inscrutable to all but the rocket scientist. Business
schools around the world keep teaching it. They
have trained thousands of financial officers,
thousands of investment advisers. In fact, as most
of these graduates learn from subsequent
experience, it does not work as advertised; and
they develop myriad ad hoc improvements,
adjustments, and accommodations to get their jobs
done. But still, it gives a comforting impression of
precision and competence.

It is false confidence, of course. The problem
lies at the roots of the standard model, in its
assumption that the best way to think about stock
markets is as a grand game of coin-tossing. If you
are going to use probability to model a financial
market, then you had better use the right kind of
probability. Real markets are wild. Their price
fluctuations can be hair-raising—far greater and
more damaging than the mild variations of
orthodox finance. That means that individual stocks and currencies are riskier than normally
assumed. It means that stock portfolios are being
put together incorrectly; far from managing risk,
they may be magnifying it. It means that some
trading strategies are misguided, and options mis-
priced. Anywhere the bell-curve assumption enters
the financial calculations, an error can come out.

History is replete with ironies. And it is one of
the greatest that the truly wild nature of markets
was re-discovered, at their cost, by two of the
most ardent formulators of orthodox economics,
Scholes and Merton. In 1993, the two Nobel
laureates joined some heavyweight Wall Street
bond traders in the creation of a new hedge fund,
Long-Term Capital Management LP. The partners
collectively contributed $100 million and raised a
war-chest that eventually topped $7 billion. Their
strategy was straightforward. They would scour
the world for occasions when, by their orthodox
valuation formulae, the prices of individual
options appeared to be wrong. They would bet
heavily—with a “leverage” or debt ratio as great
as 50-to-1—on the market’s eventually correcting the mistake. They had at one point twenty-five
Ph.D.’s on the payroll. As Sharpe, an onlooker to
the fund, told the Wall Street Journal, LTCM
“was probably the best academic finance
department in the world.”

But it blew up. After profits of 42.8 percent in
1995 and 40.8 percent in 1996, the fund in 1998 hit
turbulent markets. It had already started straying
fromthe pure academic strategy, taking hyper-risky
bets on the direction of bond prices rather than just
on market “mistakes”—much to the dismay of
Scholes. Then world tensions began mounting, and
bond prices began doing things that the models had
not forecast. The fund started losing money. In
August 1998 the Russian government defaulted on
its bonds, triggering a market meltdown. LTCM
had been one of the biggest Western traders in the
bonds, and was stuck without buyers. Worse,
contrary to the academic predictions, most of the
fund’s other investments started failing, too.
Global markets, far from displaying independent
price changes, were suddenly marching all in the
same direction at once: down. The same with volatility: up. After the fact, some economists
studied the market, and the record they compiled of
the market’s manic state is truly impressive. They
looked at the daily profits and losses of four of the
biggest global banks, as they invested in the
currency markets. To preserve the banks’
anonymity, they aggregated the data into one series.
But the effect is striking, nonetheless. The swings —up and down—at the height of the crisis show
just how wild markets can be.

A wild market. At the height of Russia’s 1998 debt
default, global markets passed through a hurricane.
This diagram, from Medova 2000, shows the
aggregate, daily profits and losses of four of the
world’s biggest banks during that period, as they
tried to cope with bucking foreign exchange
markets.


In the end, several banks reluctantly agreed to
bail out the fund through a $3.625 billion takeover.
That came only at the behest of the Federal
Reserve Board, which was concerned about a
wave of bankruptcies if LTCM went under.
Scholes himself later denied that the option-pricing
models played any but “a minor role” in the
debacle. But some of his partners do not see it
quite that way. John Meriwether, the fund’s prime
mover and the man who may have lost the most,
$150 million, told the Wall Street Journal : “Our
whole approach was fundamentally flawed.” In
launching a new fund in 2000 (Wall Street folk are
nothing if not resilient), he observed: “With
globalization increasing, you’ll see more crises.
Our whole focus is on the extremes now—what’s the worst that can happen to you in any situation—
because we never want to go through that again.”

moabal,"When I meet new prospects I dislike just listing what I do because frankly that is what everyone else does. Also, it depends on the client and scope of relationship.

I usually draw a graph and say something along the lines. ”In a perfect world, your personal wealth curve will grow exponentially if you assume a positive rate of return, periodic contributions, and time. However, there are pressures both good and bad (aka. stuff that happens in life) that pushes down on your ability for that curve to grow.”

A good financial plan factors all of these potential pressures. However, it is often difficult for someone to determine the right action steps, let alone recognize their own financial weaknesses. I specially state that the value propositions are Organization, Accountability, Objectivity, Proactivity, and Education.

Obviously, depends on the client. We have some clients that we have to beg to call us back to do our compliance enforced annual reviews. Others we talk to every month. 

From my observation (just an opinion), people who tend to post questions in this subreddit who are new to finance probably would be better off working with a good professional (obviously you have to find one first!). The people who tend to answers these questions are do it yourselfers. Same thing as those who watch financial entertainment on YouTube etc.

Basically they lock ETH for you but you get stETH. 1 Staked ETH on Lido = 1stETH.

So you also get more stETH every day you hold it in your wallet. You can sell it whenever you want wherever you want (available on Curve, Uniswap, balancer and many more dexes). 

PSA -  

1. Lido charges 10% fees on the rewards earned.
2. If you sell your stETH remember that you can't claim your locked ETH (this should be obvious but many people don't understand this part).

gmalis1,"Well, you just contradicted one of your statements.

Originally, you said that ""Seems like they made the whole customer population beta testers where there use to be actual beta testers before patches and updates went out messing up everyone’s data.""

Then you said ""Quicken has not been sufficiently beta testing"" (sic). 

So, which is it?  No beta testing or insufficient beta testing?

How do you know how many users have problems?  By looking at this forum or the Quicken Community?  How many Quicken users are there?  You can't answer any of those questions because you have zero clue as to the answers.

People on ANY forum are the ones complaining.  You're not going to see users that are happy with a product flocking to a forum to extol it's virtues and tell everyone how wonderful the product is.

Are there warts with Quicken?  Yep.  I could probably name 20 right now just off the top of my head.  Will those 20 get fixed in the next release?  Or ever?  Who knows?  Maybe they will.   Maybe they won't.  

None of them make the software unusable for me.  I rarely have transaction download issues, but all but one of my banks uses Direct Connect...a more reliable download method than Express Web Connect's screen scraper process.  I avoid the mobile and web apps.  I don't use Quicken's Bill Pay or download my bills via Quicken.  

Now, should all those work?  Yes.  Absolutely.  But I've learned to minimize my problems and avoided some pitfalls that make using Quicken or any other personal finance software frustrating.

Quicken is complex software with a very high learning curve.  It's not Mint, where you just let transactions download, fix some categories and you're done.  Users don't seem to get that.  Maybe because I started using Quicken prior to ANY downloading of transactions and transaction entry was manual entry only,  I have a greater sense of how Quicken should work.  

As to you being an accountant...goodie for you.  First off, learn to write a proper grammatical sentence.  And second, I'm a doctor.  So don't go flashing your credentials at me.  It holds zero weight.  

And finally...anyone who uses ANY product and is unhappy with it should move on to something else that fits their needs better.  The same holds true with Quicken.  Don't like it?  No one is holding a gun to your head to continue using it.",2021-08-30 20:47:09

[Exchange Traded Fund.  They have a low mgmt fee and let you buy into an idea without being stuck on a single stock.  You can get S&amp;P ETFs or Tech ETFs or Finance or Industrials or Semiconductor, etc.  If there's an industry you believe in but aren't sure where to start or want to stay diversified theyre great.  Also seeing some comments about meme stocks, Digital currency, etc.  At the end of the day you need to judge your tolerance for risk.  You're young, it's a good time to make a few risky bets that could pay off, if you have a risk-tolerant mindset.

Don't worry about the short-term. Unless you need the money to purchase a home then do not pull the money out. If I could've my told my younger self to keep the money invested and not take the short-term profit then I would have a lot more than what I have now. My avg cost on TSLA was $40 until I bought more last year before the s&amp;p addition. FB $25.

Zone_boy,"&gt;I rather take this life lesson with a good laugh though, if you don’t mind ;) Glad you only made good investments and didn’t lose any money yourself!

Yeah, it's hard to lose money with ETFs and index funds. The gains are nothing to screenshot, but I ain't losing money either. 

If you want some investment advice. Put half your money into safe investments, like ETFs/index funds/bonds. They're slow growing, but you don't have to worry about daily candles. You're basically getting 8-9% annually with ZERO effort.

But the other half should be in risker investments, speculative growth stocks. I like trying to get ahead of the curve by predicting treads. For example, the GME/AMC bullshit got a lot of people into stocks. And many of those people found the fun in trading stocks. So I looked up popular stockbrokers to see if they're publically listed. And many of them are publicly listed. So I invested into fidelity, MS, and few others. Turns out many stockbrokers are also banks. And banks are on the recovery right now with higher interest rates. So it was smart covid recovery play. And I made a decent return on those plays.

Making plays like that requires effort. You have to keep up with the news and have gut feelings on treads. And you have to be able to valuate securities yourself without relying on finance news outlets telling you what to buy. You can't fully trust them.",2021-09-01 01:45:04
neofelius,"Bit of a long answer but hopefully this helps:
The Malaysian job market is extremely screwed up (due to multiple points of failure but let's not talk about that) and there's no one ""useless degree"". A STEM degree for example allows you to practice your chosen STEM route, or if you fancy, you could hop on over to business/finance/arts etc. provided it doesn't need a mandatory qualification i.e. ACCA, IFoA etc. They give you flexibility but in return it might take longer to complete (occasionally 4 year bachelor programmes).

The way I think about it is if one day a crisis (could be a health crisis -wink wink-) hits the world and the economy goes south, who is more at risk of being considered ""unnecessary"" to the economy?

Pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, consumer goods etc. are definitely at the top of the priority list and these need a workforce with STEM skills. What comes next? The people who does the selling, marketing, fulfilling purchases, supporting customers etc. So, business, finance, admin personnel.

One thing that I don't see in this hierarchy is someone who could play the 24 Caprices or make Chopin jealous. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on the performing arts and music degrees but merely analysing from a practical point of view, not accounting for people's needs from an entertainment and leisure point of view.

To sum up, there's no ""useless"" degree but it just depends on what you're thinking of using it for. Actuarial science has been a popular choice for the past few years but seeing as massive amounts of grads get pumped out, I'd say it'll most likely end up like the IT boom or biotech boom...



My 5 sen on how I see a degree (I'm a recent graduate with about 2 years in the workforce, holding a Masters degree):
A degree can be thought of as an ""Insurance"" and a ""Ticket"" to your chosen career path

Why ""Insurance""?
Let's say you wanna be a pilot, so you went to flight school and got your flight hours to be qualified to fly commercial planes. You don't need an aeromechanical degree to fly a plane (not that I know of anyway). A mysterious virus suddenly hits mankind and BOOM you lost your job and you might need to consider other ways of making a living.

Glove sales are shooting up because of this virus, glove companies are mass hiring business/finance/admin personnel BUT the prerequisite is you need a degree, whatever the degree may be. So, in this case you could see it as a safety net if shit hits the fan kinda...

You could also think of it in other scenarios i.e. you're planning on a startup and it doesn't work out etc.

Why a ""Ticket""?
As we've discussed above, the degree is like a ticket, ""no ticket, no hire, sorry""

Important note:
We've talked about it being a ticket but please note that the ticket got brand and quality levels too!

I've been fortunate enough to work with some MNCs and for some, their hiring criteria is to only hire the from the Top 3 public universities. This is where the ""brand"" factor comes in, you bring Imperial College London ticket, everyone also interested. You bring Universiti Mangkuk ticket, even if it's super high quality, people also think twice before hiring.

Now, what is ""quality""? Quality is the skills you get from the degree. Malaysia style always like to spoon-feed, memorize etc. We're very good at repetitive tasks but when we're suddenly thrown a curve ball, half of us cry and the other half shit their pants. For example, you could have an Electrical Engineer from MIT who can do all the calculations but when the fuse in the plug burns, he/she stres cuz tak tau macam mana nak bukak plug.

It's much harder to determine the quality of the degree because you need to look into their curriculum and learning materials. People often say ""I don't use even 20% of what I learn in uni"" which in some ways is true BUT it's also better to have 19.9% of the tools you need for the job rather than 10%",2021-09-01 09:47:47
Greenappleflavor,"&gt;&gt; Well, I'm thinking right after I graduate I might start working at a hedge fund or private equity. I feel like working as a hedge fund trader, or possibly an investment banker.

This is more specific, thank you. Most people start off in IB and then they move onto private equity or start their own hedge fund. It’s not impossible to do so skipping IB, but unless you are in that field (networking), good luck doing so.


&gt;&gt; What I meant by that is that, more specifically, the stock market is prone to crashes. Just like in 2008.

What happened in 2008 was black swan and there are many pple in the finance industry specifically in investment, that can attest to having live through that from a professional stance—and they were not canned.

&gt;&gt; However, the times have changed and we may not be seeing another crash for some time, but I just felt like brining it up. Even if, hypothetically, there was some instability, it would be temporary.

There was just one in 2020, the brakers went on several times in fact. There are always market corrections but a crash is less frequent.

&gt;&gt; You were in the finance industry? Would you say your salary is good?

In, and yes, for what I do.

DeFi is a subsection of the crypto industry that allows more complex financial services than simply buying and holding an asset without the need for a centralized intermediary.*

I'd favor the latter given rock bottom interest rates and a structural shortage of treasuries in the markets (especially at the long end of the curve) due to Fed asset purchases. Some of the issuance will be purchased by those who you owe assets to so your essential just swapping actually debt (bonds) for effective debt (SS obligations). 

The taxes collected on income from retirement accounts would defease the debt. 

Alternatively if you wanted a centrally managed portfolio (similar to Canada) you just sell enough bonds to buy the non-treasury assets requires to support current retirees. Again this could help the Fed unwind it's balance sheet and provide additional long term Treasury supply. If you had a good deal of faith in the central portfolio manager (again like Canada) they can purchase income producing infrastructure assets financed by the issuance of debt.

CandleThief724,"Alright, so while waiting for Arbitrum dapps to roll out (heh), I needed some quick liquidity so I turned to AAVE *on Polygon* to open an ETH-backed CDP for some DAI.

After taking care of meatspace business there was some DAI left, so I figured: lets try to generate some yield on it! Feast your eyes on the DAI/stablecoin LP options I could find on Polygon (descending profitability):

1. IronSwap: a DEX part of a protocol (Iron Finance) that is famous for an incident where its undercollateralized stablecoin (IRON) lost its peg, and in order to compensate the protocol starting printing and selling so much of their native token (TITAN) that all investors/LP were brrrrrr-ed into bankruptcy. [Video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUokre-szPg). (40-20% APY, \~$18M TVL).
2. Something called 'ApeSwap'. (25% APY, \~$1.30M TVL).
3. Wault Finance. Could not find much info on this one. Claims to be 'connecting all the DeFi features into a *Wault* ecosystem'. Apparently it's audited. Most of the Reddit posts about it (outside of their tiny sub) are from people trying to establish its legitimacy. (20% APY, $0.45M TVL).
4. Curve. Big household name from Ethereum mainnet. Coincidentally also the first dapp on the list where, after depositing the DAI, I would be confident that it's still going to be there tomorrow. (12% APY, $6.59M TVL).
5. SushiSwap/QuickSwap. Trustworthy, but with a yield barely above AAVE's DAI interest rate. (7% APY, $1M TVL).

The sheer degeneracy of some of the protocols just brings a smile to my face. Reminds me of the early days of the 'DeFi Wild West' on L1. Sketchy protocols, absurd APYs, rugpull could happen at any moment. Even better that they hold the majority of the TVL.

MachineTeaching,"&gt;So, then, the inverted yield curve has lost validity since 09' because of larger government and Federal Reserve's counter-cyclical stabilizers, resulting in false postives since 09'? Is this correct?

Well, the yield curve never was a reliable indicator at all. Ultimately what the yield curve boils down to is investor sentiment about the future. Essentially just a guess. A guess guided by thousands of people who watch markets closely and all those things, but still a guess. They can't look into the future any more than we do.

To make a stupid example to prove a point, an asteroid could crash down on the US and destroy California, no yield curve is going to predict that. Or the severity of the current pandemic for that matter.

&gt;The survival analysis was new for me and again proves the point of the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy, is this what you would say? This would imply that fed policy is effective if done correctly, but there has to be an argument against that on some level. I'm not going to argue that. I do think the fed has a much harder time fighting deflation than inflation, which makes sense why we have the policy we do today.

Yes, especially the fed is a very technocratic institution with lots of very smart people dedicated to the fed mandate as well as economics research. They by and large do a good job and get better every day. And the government as well. The extend of stimulus programs during the pandemic for example was in part based on lessons learned from the great recession and the sluggish recovery.

&gt;Taking the final citations, I take it ABCT is at best incomplete or out-of-date for an economy like today. What strikes me is the enormity of investors and businessmen, however, who use an Austrian point of reference based on sound money. but in academia maybe it is the opposite. What is the disconnect? It seems to me there should be a synthesis. Of course thinking in terms of a single firm and in terms of aggregates are totally different. I'm not sure if you have thoughts on that, but it has bugged me.

Finance people are not economists. Of course they know some stuff about the economy, but they don't have the same tools or knowledge. They work with money as well, huge sums at times, and I think that leads to overconfidence. Coupled with a lack of knowledge of what their blindspots even *are*, you at times get weird or at the very least very incomplete views. 

Ray Dalio is a good example of this. He tries to explain how the economy works and gets some things perfectly right but misses key points of other areas:

High failure rates at the beginning of life (within the manufacturer's warranty), a long period of very few failures, and high failures at the end of life - typically outside of extended warranty coverage.

It's not that I don't think it will go up--I do think it will. I just think other coins (particularly ETH) will go up more, without more risk.

You can probably find higher APRs, but Ankr is a very reputable project in my opinion--your risk is lower here than with the BTC pool because you're only exposed to one other coin besides ETH and the coin is more reputable. Unlike the other two, I AM invested in this one pretty heavily.
3. BNB: [Venus.io](https://Venus.io) is currently yielding 4.66% on BNB. Disclaimer: I'm not personally invested in BNB and I've actually removed most of my money from the BSC ecosystem. In my opinion, the entire reason BSC was worthwhile was that it had low fees and a vibrant DeFi ecosystem. Now that both Polygon and Solana have much lower fees, there's no reason to be on BSC. Even if you're okay with BSC's fees, the Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Optimism networks all have comparable fees, are actually decentralized (which BSC is not), and have faster-growing ecosystems. When I was involved in the BSC ecosystem, I always viewed it as a short-term investment, and the term of that investment has passed for me: I'm overall pessimistic about the possibility of Binance revitalizing this ecosystem when there are so many alternatives that are just clearly better.",2021-09-06 01:28:01

BCOs allow for a steady stream of finance and collateral to flow into the project in lockstep with the development of the protocol and the products within it.

crypto-devk,"If you put stETH and ETH into a Curve pool, the stETH/ETH will no longer be yours, it will belong to the pool.

However, in return, you'll get a token crvstETH, which represents your proportional ownership of the pool. E.g, if the pool was 999 ETH/stETH, and you deposit 1 ETH, you'll get 0.1% ownership of the pool, including any future profits.

As long as 1 ETH = 1 stETH, and Curve's smart contract doesn't have any bugs, this means you'll never lose more than you put in.

You still get the staking rewards for stETH, but be aware that since the pool tries to be 50% ETH and 50% stETH, you'll only get half the rewards. So you have to make sure that the LP income from fees, and any yield farming rewards make up for that.

You can also stake into convex finance for additional rewards.

If you're only depositing a small amount (or if in your jurisdiction, capital gains tax is lower than income tax), I'd recommend depositing into a yield aggregator like yearn, pickle, or harvest. They automatically sell your CRV, LIDO, and Convex rewards, and using it to buy more stETH for you, giving you compound interest.",2021-09-06 06:58:19
Calvinbolic,"Moonriver (MOVR) defi layer 1 Blockchain built on top of Kusama. Already have 200 plus projects looking to deploy on top of them. Sushiswap and cream finance are already confirmed to be launching on MOVR. 

I see MOVR pulling a Terra Luna.. Luna is built on Cosmos but eclipsed Cosmos in growth and market cap and I see Moonriver potentially doing the same thing and passing Kusama. 

Moonriver is currently at a sub $250mill marketcap. It's layer 1 season right now with pretty much every major layer 1 going to the moon right now. Luna, Solana, ETH, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony etc all are layer 1 blockchains that have had a massive run up due to defi being built on top of them. Now look at their multi billion dollar marketcap compared to the sub 250 mill of Moonriver. 

They're already listed on exchanges that do decent volume such as Kraken, Gate, and Kucoin. It's just a matter of time for these 200+ projects to deploy and drive up the value of Moonriver. Wouldn't be surprised to see AAVE, Beefy, Curve, balancer(may of already announced that they're deploying I'll have to double check), and other big name defi players to come on board not to mention new projects. 

Am I saying that MOVR will instantly blow up to the level of layer 1's such as Solana or Luna? No, it's at such a low marketcap that it doesn't have to. Even getting to a 1 billion marketcap is a 4X from here",2021-09-06 08:22:16
rampage1998,"Thank you everybody, you are amazing people and your advices are very helpful. Appreciate all the helps. Maybe this topic is also useful for the newcomers. I surprised how helpful and friendly this community here and the crypto ecosystem is. (Except for some obvious scammers).

I read several guide/tutorials about Defi. Watched several Youtube videos.   
  
Then I tried some practice and tried the following:  
On BSC chain:  
1 unit to (manual) CAKE pool on PCS and farm on autofarm at 90.45% (it seems to be a little better than the Auto Cake pool on PCS);  
3 units to WBNB-CAKE LP on PCS and farm on autofarm at 50.69%;  
1 unit to  WBNB-BELT on PCS and farm on autofarm at 137.65%;  
1 unit to WBNB-CAKE LP on MDEX and farm on autofarm at 74.35%, however their website is constantly error time out for me so maybe I should take it out. 

On Polygon chain:  
Tried to add 0.5 unit LP to the WETH-WMATIC on Quickswap and farm at autofram at 28.57%, but their website seems to be rather slow for me, and I just saw actually WETH-WMATIC on Sushi can give 35.61% at autofram, I think I'll move to Sushi instead.   
For my ETH deposit on AAVE on Polygon, I tried to borrow around 30% of the value for DAI,  bought some MATIC with it, then redeposit on AAVE. But the interest is rather low now. 

On mainnet:  
I looked at staking at Lido then maybe farm/yield at Curve finance, the rates seems to be just the same or even less then staking BETH at Binance (I got around 8.59% I think). 

Looked at stETH vault on yearn.finance but the cost is insane it's like $431 / 0.11ETH just for deposit, not to mention I heard withdraw fee is even more. Guess I need more crypto holdings to use that. 

Will read and watch more stuff to decide what's the next move. Defi has its risks also comes with high return. It seems to be interesting and has helped crypto reach the new top and even higher for sure.

Jake_FromStateFarm27,"California you'd make that much and more except the cost of living is through the roof so it's really the equivalent of alot less. 

I would reccomend NJ and NY state. Cost of living is also significantly increasing there as well and the market is competitive but if you're getting a masters you'll be promising in NJ and meet the state standards requirement in New York. 

Alot of NJ schools especially the sciences pay starting 55k (I'm history and make between the 50-60k for reference in a declining subject) you will scale very well in NJ and it will be easier to find a position as well. Unsure about NY scale but it's a state law for teachers to obtain their masters within 4 years I believe so you'll be ahead of the curve and they may even help finance it.

If you want to increase your pay scale you can do what's called a plus 30 and that can increase your pay between 5-10k (usually only 5) it's essentially a 30 credit program in education/admin/leadership studies.

Dave-1066,"A reasonable time frame is two years. That doesn’t necessarily mean you’d have to wait two years to be profitable, but it does mean that the learning curve for forex is long. And it needs to be long- it’s a vast field. 

The major areas you need to cover are fundamental analysis, technical analysis, the varied styles of trading, the nature of each currency, and finally the *process itself*. 

The latter is a very big subject and covers everything from time frames to risk management to leverage and spread and the many set-ups. A person can have a strong understanding of trading theory, but it’s the actual process of trading that so many newer traders mess up. Small issues like simply checking spreads or making sure to not blindly jump into the most volatile periods of the day - stuff that books often don’t even bother to discuss. 

A few are fortunate to have had a previous background in finance, but it’s not the colossal advantage that some think it is. Even with significant financial experience in the institutional setting you find that retail trading is a very very different game. 

The simplest answer, for your purposes, is to just start a demo account and trade it while doing something like the babypips course and reading Kathy Lien, Brent Donnelly, and Adam Grimes. The vast majority of all other forex authors are frauds with no formal market training or education. 

Keep the demo account going, watch some quality content, keep studying, and six months later you should be in a position to go live and start losing money. Kidding. After six months you ought to be ready to stick some money online and start trading a hyper-cautious style. You could go live sooner, but I don’t recommend it- arrogance is the downfall of a massive percentage of retail traders who simply got lucky in their demo environment.

yes_no_ok_maybe,"This isn’t actuary math but did involve a lot of algebra - I recently updated the dynamic lapse formula for our company’s retirement business.

It ended up of the form y = ae^(bx) + c, with the parameters calibrated to run through key points on a lapse vs rate differential curve (the rate difference is our crediting rate vs a competitor’s rate).

There was also an adjustment for termination provision (example: market value adjustment) and I had to find equivalent adjustments for two other exit provisions based on the time value of money. And then actually for one of them we didn’t go with pure mathematical equivalence, we introduced an “irrationality” factor because of feedback from our sales team, and justified it using concepts from behavioral finance.

What else? Oh also as part of that project we updated the competitor rate proxy in our model which involved finding rates from a real competitor over the last 5 years, then back testing market rates that would have served as good proxies. It needed to be fairly simple so I tested treasury and corporate bond yields at different tenors &amp; credit qualities, and the test was trying to find the lowest standard deviation of the difference between proxy rate and actual rate (in other words, which one had the most similar shape).

The Citadel is a physical symbol of the capitalist system, like Wall Street. But Rick-C137’s scope of power is not just in the citadel. 

C-137 Rick made a Central Finite Curve (metaphor for the centralized financial system) that captured all the universes in which Ricks were the smartest person in their respective universe, and built a closed off system within the infinite universe where these powerful Ricks abused Mortys and other Ricks as expendable resources like labor and energy. 

Like a founding father, Rick C-137 assumed that everyone else would be stuck in this system forever. Until Evil Morty became President of the Citadel, he realized the only way out of the whole system was to escape the Central Finite Curve. 

Even the protagonist Morty wouldn’t escape the system (leave his Rick) because the system makes him feel dependent on it. Evil Morty is the only Morty smart enough to understand why Mortys think they need Ricks, but he’s built different (kinda like Apes) so he leaves the system behind and warps out.

KoolAid90,"I pursued an advanced degree in finance at a school whose MBA is T25.  As such I took many classes that had MBA students in them. All the professors I interacted with had PhDs from top schools, with many from the M7. In reference to an underprivileged background and having to essentially grow on my own, I came to many realizations. Some of them are below.

1. Schools get a lot of funding for research.
2. My professors (PhDs) increase their standing by publishing and researching.
3. A lot of professors don't want to teach and would rather just research instead of teaching. I honestly don't blame them. Even if I am getting paid $150k - $200k, I don't want to deal with students.
4. Professors don't like office hours because people interrupt their research. Not to mention they probably ask why this student didn't get the material the first time I verbally glossed over it?
5. It is easy to simply regurgitate very, very basic concepts than useful, substantive material that can be practically applied. Further, to use the same powerpoint, semester after semester created by a third party vendor or previous course. Then when exam time comes, ask for the application of the very basic concepts to very theoretical situations that frequently do not really happen in the real world.

Case: Learning about the spot rate / forward curve. I had to watch youtube, read the textbook, and peruse online PDFs / E-books from the university library. Now as a finance professional, I realized that back then I didn't even know what a Par Curve was and that the notation itself which was presented in class was not industry standard.

TLDR: Yes, you have to learn almost everything by yourself. In my experience the very basic of the basics is presented in class. The homework is a stretch. The exam then often asks for the basics of the basics to be applied to very unique, theoretical situations making it extremely difficult.",2021-09-07 21:32:29

SCATesteR,"I made this transition about 4 years ago, was a systems administrator now working in risk management.


First thing to call out based on your post above, when you switch to a GRC role, you are not necessarily going from a ""IT Guys supporting computers"" to a ""Guys supporting IT guy's"" role, your transitioning to a ""Guys protecting the company through direction"" role. As a security focused person, there will be times that based on regulation requirements, risk assessments, audit findings, etc. that you will dictate that changes are needed that may not jive with the teams who are ""hands on the keyboard"" supporting the systems, but ultimately hoping putting the company in a more secure position. 


That being said here's my list of pro's and cons':

Pro's:

* Your technical background will help drive security conversation, both through driving policy/controls and (if you go the audit route) testing of controls. 
* your going to see more of the business then you normally would have in your tech role, because of what GRC roles require. 
* While (and this is personal experience) I do have to work later then I would like to, I'm not on call/rotation. 
* Financially,  one of the best fields to be in

Con's/Tough area's:

* You are going to look like the ""bad guy"" in some scenarios to tech teams, because ""you don't understand what we are actually doing"". This is where your tech background will really help drive and make that conversation more digestible. 
* Your going to be expected to be confident in your choices and justification behind them. Something simple as changing a password policy requirement can have a huge impact on user experience, helpdesk calls, etc. all for the belief that you think it will make the company more secure and is in alignment with best practices. 
* Be expected to speak and relay information a Director+ level who is not technical what so ever. Not everyone that is involved with security is techy (HR, Finance, etc.), you need to be able to relay well formulated information to them in a manner they can easily digest to get the full picture. 

As far as the rush hours and hard times, I think your going to find that, depending on the role and company, that will be pretty typical. I work at a financial institution and work roughly 9-10 hours a day just to make sure I get everything done and ready, but I also am in charge of risk management for one of our BU's. Could I stick to an 8 hour day, sure, but I also like to not stress about deadlines and stay ahead of the curve. 

All in all, is the transition difficult, no its not. If anything it'll help you because now your on the opposite side of the fence and rather being told do x because policy y, your now helping ensure / develop / test against policy Y. I know this post is somewhat ""vague"" but until you know exactly what you want to do in security, getting to those finer details of what to expect can be a little difficult to pinpoint.",2021-09-07 22:34:48

Coal could spiral to USD 200/t this winter

Nathan Witkop

3-4 minutes

Benchmark coal prices have tripled off last year’s pandemic-induced lows to scale 13-year highs approaching USD 180/t in Asia and USD 170/t in Europe. 

Energyscan highlighted a combination of supply and demand pressures heading into the peak consumption season that risked extending this year’s rally in both basins.

Inventories in key regions including China, India, Europe and the US were at multi-year lows on the back of a strong recovery in power demand. 

Demand has surged thanks to Asian economic recovery, as well as record high costs for gas and carbon in Europe that had priced more coal back into power generation, said Energyscan.

Its analysts noted a 41% year-on-year rise in coal-fired generation so far in 2021 across France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and the UK. 

German coal-fired generation had jumped to a EUR 20/MWh advantage over gas-fired competition by September, reversing a slight advantage enjoyed by gas up until summer, according to Energyscan estimates of lower efficiency coal and gas plants. 

“Despite record high CO2 prices in Europe, coal-fired power plants are running baseload in several countries as they are largely more competitive than gas-fired ones for spot and short-term delivery, a situation likely to remain relevant this winter with rising gas demand for heating purposes.” 

Chinese restocking needs
A similarly tight situation was unfolding in China, the world’s largest coal user responsible for more than half global consumption.  

Chinese thermal power demand – overwhelmingly met with coal – was up 15% year on year over the first seven months of 2021 even as the country’s own coal production has weakened since June to begin falling below the output of the past two years amid regulatory mine closures.  

This has opened a gaping need to restock, with Chinese total coal inventories of around 100m tonnes standing at their lowest level in at least five years and less than half where they were in the pre-pandemic year of 2019. 

“In the short term, restocking activity at Chinese coal plants is likely to provide support to the Pacific seaborne market,” Energyscan said. 

“The USD 200/t mark could be hit for spot coal prices in both basins in case of further unplanned constraints on the supply side.”

Exporters hampered
Global seaborne suppliers have struggled to meet import needs due to a combination of poor investment in new production, Covid disruptions to workforces as well as unfavourable weather conditions in major producers like Indonesia and Australia. 

China’s ban on Australian coal has additionally reshuffled typical supply routes, adding to congestion and freight costs in a shipping market already stressed by rebounding demand for other commodities. 

“Looking at the forward curve, we can see that this tightness is spreading through 2022 maturities on the back of growing reluctance from Western banks to finance coal upstream assets,” said the report.

The main downside risks to coal this winter would likely come from a retreat in gas prices – via an increase in Russian gas exports to Europe – or from a significant improvement in Chinese supply, it added.",2021-09-08 12:16:50
Awesprens,"Hey! I feel you, and as someone who wasn't taught finance stuff, I know that the learning curve is high and overwhelming. It seems like you have learned a lot and have started implementing what you've learned!!

I truly feel like unless you HAVE to, you should continue living alone and find other ways to cut costs or make money. If living alone makes you happy, that is a huge sacrifice right now. Life needs balance. Edited to add: of rent is a huge burden maybe the balance can be moving to a smaller place/a little outside of city center but maintaining access to transit. 

Definitely find a new job, and be open to what's out there but do not jump ship with rose colored goggles right into the next thing available.I learned that big salary increases tend to come from switching jobs. Even a small increase could help relieve some stress.

I also reevaluated all the things I thought I wanted and started talking/journaling my way out of wanting those things. I committed to using up what I already had (skincare, food) and not trying new trendy things. I saved a ton of money this way. I made a pinterest board about minimalist philosophy, about things like saving time cleaning, easier time moving, saving money. When I wanted something, I wrote it on a ""wants"" list and gave it some time. I ended up not buying most of the things because I was obsessing over something in the moment but it didn't stick.

throwaway048892,"In terms of substantive knowledge, out of the transactional practices, I would say structured finance is probably the most complex. It has a steep learning curve, but there's a lot of duping in these deals (mostly in the securitizations) so they usually don't require a deep knowledge of anything to do the day-to-day work.

Obviously tax is more complicated. There's a 2000-page treatise devoted to just securitization tax. 

I would think bank reg and payment law are also fairly complicated.",2021-09-08 23:14:48

TL,DR: Blair was instrumental in increasing private sector involvement in the economy (especially the finance sector). The labour party also started to question the welfare-consensus of the post-war-era. The fall (and perceived failure) of the eastern bloc was used to discredit state intervention. The rhetoric of solidarity employed during the election campaigns never translated into policy and Labour kept sticking to the economic model laid out by the Tories.

I have to admit, that calling him an outright Neoliberal is somewhat polemic and probably not entirely accurate. But one would have expected a social democrat to reverse the Thatcherite reforms of the prior governments, but that didn't happen. Blair was slightly ahead of the curve but consistent with a broader shift in European social democracy that accepted the neoliberal consensus instead of pushing back. (The German ""Agenda 2010"" is a perfect example.)",2021-09-09 02:28:24

doducduy96,"So you have a paid off Nissan, you pay what $30/tank? Now you want to finance a $45,000 Model 3 at lets assume a 4% APR for 60 months for the amount of , that’ll put you at $829 per month and the total cost of the car including all interest will be $49,725. So that’ll be a $46,725 upgrade from your $3000 Nissan. Assuming it costs you $30/tank for the Nissan and $5/full charge for the Tesla, it’ll take 1869 full tank of gas or 467,250 miles @250 miles per full tank for the gas saving to offset the upgrade cost. If taking into account the repair cost it’ll also take the Nissan 10 engine replacements or 10 transmission replacements to offset the upgrade cost to a Model 3. 
Not to mention the hidden cost of insurance, you can pay $30/month liability on the $3000 paid off Nissan while you’ll have to pay full comprehensive coverage on the Tesla which can cost $100 on the low end to $300+ per month. At this point you are paying $1000+ just for the car per month. 
Here’s the final point. The Nissan has already reached the bottom of its depreciation curve, as long as it drives and has A/C you can always sell it for $3000. The Tesla, while they are remarkably excellent in holding their value if they only have modest mileage, the mileage you rack up while doing delivery gigs will 100% depreciate your car just like any other cars. Nobody wants a 80k mile Tesla. 

If you want to buy a Tesla AND CAN COMFORTABLY AFFORD IT just buy it. Don’t try to rationalize the decision with the delivery gigs.

mvw2,"College is a light peppering of the basics but also a lot of stuff you'll probably never use.  It's good for fundamentals, for understanding, and building the skill set to research and problem solve.  However, most of what you'll know is learned on the job over years of time.

Depending on your scope of work, engineering can be wildly different.  Your engineering experience will be mostly based on the employer that hires you.  They will be the biggest driver in what you do, the scope of work, work-life balance, etc.  Everything good and bad about engineering will almost entirely depend on who employs you.  This also means it's pretty easy to change said good or bad experience simply by changing employers.

Personally, I've aimed for smaller companies and companies that are turnkey manufacturers with a wide range of products (say 50+ unique products).  This means my work is broad in scope.  The engineering department will be small.  Engineering as a function is basically everything under the sun.  And one gets to have their hands in just about everything.  The downside is much of it is trial by fire because you will do it all and be expected to do it all.  Want to know how a punch turret or laser works?  Don't worry, you'll learn.  Want to know more about welding?  They'll teach you and tell you when you've messed up.  Want to get better at DFM and DFA?  Don't worry, it will be hands on and intimate.  Hey, can you find an alternate vendor for part X?  The press brake is being goofy; go take a look at it and see if you can fix it.  There's a customer on the phone for product Y looking for tech support; do you have free time to help him out?  A customer's asking for a custom quote similar to product Z but they want these 7 changes; can you get me a costed quote for the new design by the end of the day?  We have to redesign product Q due to new UL requirements.  You have one month to make the design change and get the product recertified through UL for production scheduled next month.  We're introducing new product T, and we need you to lay out and set up the new production line.  We want this up and running in two weeks. Oh, and we also need SOPs and test procedures made.

Now depending on the type of person you are, that either makes your nether regions feel funny in the special way or frightens the hell out of you.

The ""what"" of your work almost entirely depends on the employer.  It's almost to the point where your title doesn't matter.  I'm a manufacturing engineer by degree.  I was hired on as a manufacturing engineer by my first employer.  I did not do manufacturing engineering.  Heck, I've almost done zero manufacturing engineering my entire career.  90% of my career has been design engineering, product development, design spec through full scale production stuff.  But I've also been manufacturing support for the factory floor and personnel.  I've been vendor sourcing.  I've been tech support.  I've done some aspects of finance.  I've worn a lot of hats, usually all at the same time, and much of it has absolutely nothing to do with my degree.

What about the romance, the joy, the passion of engineering.  What about the fantasy of it all?

Well, that depends.  Much of what makes engineering actually great is finding an employer that can give you the experience you want.  Half of this is just you knowing what you actually want and like doing.  The second half is finding an employer who can actually give you that experience.  I've been pretty lucky.  I spent 10 years in college figuring out my half.  I lucked out with my first employer on the type of work, although the pay and work-life balance was terrible.  Regular 60-65 hour weeks was the norm.  Several 15 hour days a week was the norm.  ""Optional"" (mandatory) Saturdays was the norm.  I learned a TON, but it was only a temporary good.  I moved on.  My current employer is 40 hours a week, and it's almost hard to get more.  I have the same huge scope of work I like in a much more relaxed environment.  I just go to work and play every day.  I haven't really actually ""worked"" a day in 10 years.  I just play and they keep paying me. It's a good place.  The company has a good blend of people and culture, and the size and type of company gives me the work scope and roles I personally like and seek out.

If you want to fulfill the fantasy, you need to spend the time to know yourself, what you want, and what you enjoy.  Then you need to spend the time seeking out an employer that can give you the work experience that meets your desires.  Both can take time, and you will need to be flexible.

What about the actual engineering.  What about the actual work?

Well, work is an entire pizza.  College is the small scattered pieces of parmesan you sprinkle on top.  College is tiny, bite-sized pieces of stuff, but you never really experience the whole thing.  You are never tasked with a 400 hour project from start to finish.  Even a capstone is like two weeks of actual work, which is effectively nothing.  8 hours today, 8 hours tomorrow, 40 hours this week, 40 hours next week, this entire month, and all of next month, 300 hours solid all spent on one task.  You'll feel this for the first time once you're in your career.  The scale is relatively huge compared to anything you've done, and the time is immense.  You might be on and off again on the same project over an entire year or two, the same project for 2 years straight through various stages of development and progression into production.  That's half your time at college, just working on one thing.

Another aspect is rapid learning.  Early on, you are not expected to know everything.  They expect this.  However, they do expect you to learn rapidly.  Write everything down.  Fill notebooks with stuff.  Make spreadsheets.  There will be a lot of content coming to you in order for you to be competent at your job.  You will need to learn this stuff, memorize it and/or record it.  You shouldn't have to be taught twice.  You will be hands-on with a LOT of new stuff, and there's a huge learning curve.  It's also often steep.  You will be overwhelmed.  You will feel overwhelmed.  This is normal.  You will also make lots of mistakes.  You will, and there's nothing you can do about it.  Mistakes are education.  Each and every one of them teaches you something new. Do not feel bad about making a mistake.  Only feel bad about repeating that mistake.

Impostor syndrome is real.  One crazy part about being an engineer is everyone has an expectation of you as a smart problem solver.  They have this tendency for you to know everything, to fix every problem, and they will demand it from you all the time.  Early on, you will very much not feel like this person.  You aren't.  For the most part, you just fake it.  You rely on your skills in college to research and problem solve.  You both learn and solve their problems at the same time.  And you get better.  You keep getting better as more problems come and more solutions are found.  You will often question their sanity as they blindly trust you.  You will find it unsettling and weird for them to so willfully accept your solutions.  You will just be winging it for years and years, but they will be happy that you fixed their issue every time.  And you did.  You did fix every single one of them.

What you don't often realize is exactly how much you grow over time.  Over the years of feeling under skilled and bewildered by their blind trust in your ability to basically Google their problems away, you will get good.  You will have accrued a wealth of knowledge and skills, and you do grow into that perception of what an engineer is.  You might not be that at first, but holy hell you will be in the end.

It takes about 2 years to get comfortable in a job.  It doesn't happen overnight.  By about 10 years, you will be highly skilled at what you do, exceptional in your talents.  

How good you are depends on your employer and scope of work.  Much of your early years will be learning.  You will want to work for employers that are devices of continued growth.  If you are stagnant, if you are not learning anything new, and if your scope and responsibility remains small, leave.  Don't waste your time being some place that doesn't help you grow and hone your skills.  You NEED to be able to do this in your early years.  It will help you immensely later on when you start hunting for a more permanent home.  If they are not adding value to your career, change employers.  In conjunction, I also suggest asking for more work, more projects, to be taught new stuff, to get hands-on experience with machinery, operations, etc.  The more open and eager you are to your boss and company, the more opportunities you have.  It often does mean more work and more responsibility, but this is where growth happens.  It's paid off for me twice though.  I learned a ton and have become highly skilled in my craft.  I become the one guy the entire company goes to for help and answers, and I've been promoted into management twice due to this character.  I'm only 10 years into my career, and I've gotten to the point where my boss is the CEO of the company, twice.  I regularly work on multi-million dollar projects and think nothing about it.  And 10 years ago, I was a wet behind the ears, green kid who was freaked out about his first task.  Within the next 10 years, I expect two things.  I expect to own my own business, mainly just to have fun, and I expect to be CEO of a company that's not my side business.

You build your empire.  You build it on effort, hard work, and dedication.  You build it on positive attitude and no mental walls.  You build it striving to be better than you can image today.  You become something better than what you are capable of idealizing.  It all starts at the beginning and defined by the path you take.",2021-09-09 12:05:44
FourFourFakinTwo,"SS: El Salvador’s bitcoin gambit has heaped fresh pressure on the country’s debt market after investors began selling its bonds earlier this year on rising concerns about the government of President Nayib Bukele. On the first day of El Salvador’s trailblazing adoption of bitcoin as legal tender, the cryptocurrency’s global price slumped by more than 10 per cent. Undeterred, Bukele tweeted that his small central American nation had increased its holdings. “Buying the dip. 150 new coins added. #Bitcoinday,” he wrote, adding a winking emoji. Bond traders were not impressed. A fresh round of selling this week pushed the yield on long-dated Salvadoran debt issued in dollars close to 11 per cent while shorter maturities were offering up to 14 per cent. Prior to Bukele announcing the crypto move in June, Salvadoran long-dated yields were around 8.5 per cent. In a further sign of market stress, the yield curve on El Salvador’s bonds inverted on Tuesday, meaning that short-dated debt was priced below long-dated debt. “That in itself is never a good sign,” said Dean Tyler, head of global markets at BancTrust. “It shows people are starting to question the viability of the shorter end of the curve.” Investors were not convinced by the risky and expensive bet on bitcoin by what is one of the poorer countries in the western hemisphere with an annual GDP of $25bn. The coin’s value has swung from $10,000 to $64,000 in the past year, and is back down at $46,000 now. Bukele’s rushed plan to introduce the volatile digital asset for everyday transactions made headlines around the world. “If I told you I’m now going to pay your salary in bitcoin, you’d have a lot of questions,” said Michael Schlein, chief executive of Accion, a non-profit that invests in tech for financial inclusion. “The notion of poor people keeping savings in crypto is absurd. It’s wildly volatile and you’re talking about the most vulnerable people in the world.” Weekly newsletter For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click But traders said the latest slump in Salvadoran bond prices was not only down to nerves over what could prove to be a reckless crypto gamble; money managers are also troubled by the president’s attempts to increase his power. Late on Friday night the Salvadoran supreme court ruled that the president could seek a second consecutive term — a decision condemned by the US. It comes months after the Bukele-controlled congress fired five supreme court justices and replaced them with loyalists. “The market had priced in the bitcoin news,” said Kevin Daly, investment director at Aberdeen Standard. “The news that really shook the market was [Bukele’s] gerrymandering things to run for re-election.” This, he said, had pushed the risk premium demanded by investors for holding Salvadoran debt to the highest level of any solvent emerging market. Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed income at Amherst Pierpont, said the court ruling had complicated the chances of El Salvador agreeing a new IMF programme and securing access to much-needed external funds for its dollarised economy. “It’s all about the Bukele risk premium,” she said. “It’s all centralised decision-making and he’s not surrounded by a top-notch team of technocrats.” The IMF has opposed the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender, citing risks to financial stability, consumer protection and the environment. “The most direct cost of widespread adoption of a cryptoasset such as Bitcoin is to macroeconomic stability . . . Monetary policy would lose bite. Central banks cannot set interest rates on a foreign currency,” it wrote in July. “Without robust anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism measures, cryptoassets can be used to launder ill-gotten money, fund terrorism and evade taxes,” it added. Recommended The FT ViewThe editorial board El Salvador’s dangerous gamble on bitcoin El Salvador needs $3.5bn-$4bn in foreign funding a year to finance its deficit, cover the costs of coping with the pandemic and roll over existing debt. The government has said that the introduction of bitcoin as legal tender would cost around $200m initially. It last issued a bond in July 2020 but has not been able to tap the market again since, Morden added. “Bukele is still running a fiscal deficit of about double the pre-Covid level and debt is 90 per cent of GDP.” With a large debt repayment of $800m looming in January 2023, Bukele has limited room for manoeuvre. Morden said a recent increase in the country’s IMF allocation of special drawing rights — a reserve asset that allows the lender to supplement member countries’ official reserves — would provide short-term relief but after that, the government might be forced to turn to its own citizens to fund itself. “The locals are the lenders of last resort,” she said. “But if they aren’t willing to lend, there may be a shift towards coercive lending” such as potentially nationalising private pensions, or even capital controls. Or, as Daly put it: “There’s a real risk this all ends in tears.”",2021-09-09 17:16:04
gorbachevshammer,"
&gt;I actually don't care a great deal about defending austerity, my point was just that you can advocate for the rights of social groups and at the same time support fiscal policy that won't necessarily benefit them, it's called the doctrine of double effect.

It's not that austerity doesn't benefit them, it's that austerity does disproportionate harm to them, while providing no significant benefit to society. The principle of double effect requires that an act do good while doing harm unintentionally. This both misrepresents the overall impacts of austerity, and the typical underlying notions behind it.


&gt;I would rather live in a country in which most people can eat than one which is more strictly equitable on which most people can't eat. 

No clue why you're saying this as if they are the only two options.


&gt;It's not really rocket science, they nationalised everything they could, overspent on their fossil fuel industry running up to a glut and then printed an obscene amount of Bolivars in an attempt to dog their way out of their crisis. This wouldn't have happened if they had an economically conservative government. 

This is a gross oversimplification if Venezuela's situation. No amount of austerity would have fixed the impact of plummetting oil prices on a single resource economy, it just would have hastened it's downfall. The inability of the Government to undertake relaxed fiscal policy is one of the factors which exacerbated the Great Depression in the US.


&gt;Not necessarily, have you ever looked into Ireland's economy? They weren't far off a few third world countries in the 90s and now they're one of the greatest success stories of the last 20 years. They have stronger welfare programs than many countries with higher corporate tax rate paid for by tax revenue created through jobs in the finance sector. Super common in tax havens aswell. 

I'm not sure what your argument here is, Ireland's economy isn't conservative by any means. Furthermore, Ireland's national debt per Capita is the highest in the EU. Unless you're attempting to make the laffer curve argument, which has been debunked repeatedly.


&gt;When I said market socialism I meant State Socialism which is very much an ML philosophy.

You're making yourself look even more uninformed. China is explicitly not a state socialist nation, it's a heavily regulated state capitalist nation by design. The goal of revisionist china is to exploit capitalism in order to develop to a state where a transition to socialism is feasible.

&gt; Trying to argue that the CCP isn't ideologically left wing because they have markets is definitely a no true Scotsman fallacy. 


The issue isn't that the CCP has markets or that the CCP isnt ideologically left wing. A market socialist society has markets and is still left wing. The issue is the ownership structure of capital in China, which is certainly not socialist. A governing party can be ideologically left aligned while not currently undertaking socialist reforms.",2021-09-10 00:26:37

illram,"As far as getting everything off RH, I’d do that ASAP in whatever the most cost effective manner is for doing that.

As far as exchanges vs elsewhere, my quick explanation: (Tl;dr, stake your ETH yourself then use your liquid staked tokens to earn more ETH) 

1. As far as exchanges go, I like Gemini. I used Kraken in the past, they were fine too. Honestly I haven’t used a centralized exchange in so long I can’t comment on how they currently stack up, but if this is what you want to do, pick whatever one has the best eth staking\earning options (I believe Kraken and Coinbase have staking, while Gemini has an “earn” interest account) and whichever has the smoothest cash deposit options for you. But you will be limited to whatever their APY is and if you stake on Coinbase or Kraken I believe there is nothing else you can do with your ETH during the lockup phase. Safest option, probably, but also least lucrative.

2. For other non exchange options, you can either lend your ETH on a centralized platform like Celsius, a decentralized one like Compound, or you can stake in a service like Lido or Rocketpool and earn whatever their APY is. Lending to Celsius is straightforward and definitely a set it and forget it thing, but I’d use a staking service that provides you a liquid token, rather than just lend your ETH. Staking supports the network and with services like Rocketpool or Lido, you can use your synthetic ETH tokens that they give you to represent your stake elsewhere in the defi ecosystem, like Curve or Yearn or Pickle finance to earn additional yield. 

Personally I’d go with option 2 and do something like Rocketpool. Then when you get more comfortable and learn more about the defi space that is built on top of your synthetic staked ETH (among other things), you can put your rETH or stETH or sETH to work.",2021-09-10 14:45:50

How to do basic cleaning. Laundry. Cook anything that didn't go from the freezer to the microwave. Take care of a pet (OF NOTE: no animals were harmed by me. My first cat got the basics and TONS of love but he was a HUGE learning curve on how to feed QUALITY food in proper amounts, routine vet care for exams and shots, how to deal with behavior problems, etc. He got everything he needed to be healthy and know he was loved and welcomed, it was all finer points of logistics stuff I didn't know and made some mistakes), how to open and use checking and savings or any basic finance for that matter, pretty much anything.

**Quirks:** Hard to Pilot, Difficult to Maintain, Bad Reputation (Inner Sphere), Accurate Weapon (LRM 10)

**Overview:** Product of a long and (questionably) distinguished design philosophy, the 49th iteration of the odd discus-shaped Avrocar was originally developed by the Rim Worlds Republic as a fast scout and harasser.  While only just entering production when Kerensky conquered the Republic, the first production run was discovered in a mothballed semi-concealed factory centuries later.  While sourcing parts to resume production is difficult in the Periphery, the original production run is being offered for sale to finance the operation.

**Capabilities:** Lightly armored and fragile as most hovercraft, the Avrocar relies heavily on its high speed for protection.  The turret-mounted LRM 10 provides respectable firepower with plentiful range, but leaves the craft heavily dependent on ammunition for its effectiveness. A single turret-mounted medium laser provides backup, but crews are generally warned not to get into range to use it.  The designers plainly intended to make use of advanced Star League technologies, the turret includes mounting points for an Artemis system, and a large empty electronics bay in the hull would easily fit an active probe or ECM system, though no such systems are installed on the production model.  In more impressive, and difficult to repair, terms, the turret is on the underside of the craft, the entire under-curve of the hull is suspended from a magnetic rail, allowing it to whip about to any angle with shocking speed, though the system is a power-hog and vulnerable to terrain as much as enemy fire.

**Designer Comments:** I used a slightly different load-out (2 LRM 5s instead of LRM 10, Medium Laser forward instead of turret mounted, added TAG &amp; armor) in a MegaMek/MekHQ campaign.  Other than MegaMek's cheating in favor of the bot to disable any/all of my vehicles upon looking at them harshly, it performed fairly well.  Fragile as all get out, but usually able to find cover and hide, with fast VTOLs as spotters for indirect fire.  Moment of glory was mission-killing a Timber Wolf with a single LRM volley to the back... 2 LRMs through armor into an ammo bin.  Conceptually its based on its namesake, the Avro Canada VZ-9 Avrocar.",2021-09-11 09:23:19

TigerInKS,"That EdgeHD 8 will certainly be more stable on the EQ6 than the C11 you were asking about before.  But now you're not getting any more light grasp for DSOs visually (assuming that's still your interest) than the 8"" dob you have and you're still trying to get into AP with a long focal length scope.  Were you planning on getting rid of the dob to finance this endeavor, or are you planning on running two separate rigs?

Everything I've read and been told about getting into DSO AP (and I'm guessing since you're doing research you've read the same things) is that starting out at long focal lengths is a recipe for frustration (guiding tolerances, polar align tolerances, seeing effects, mount stability, etc.)  They are issues that can be overcome, certainly, but you're giving yourself the steepest learning curve.

If you're only planning on doing planetary AP, this would be fine (heck, go for the EdgeHD 9.25 if you've got the $$).  If you really want to get into DSO AP, and it were my money, I'd keep the dob for visual and change the scope in this list to something like an 80mm triplet.",2021-09-11 20:56:35

Usmonster,"copying from one of my older comments because it goes deeper:


The Citadel is a physical symbol of the capitalist system, like Wall Street. But Rick-C137’s scope of power is not just in the citadel. 

C-137 Rick made a Central Finite Curve (metaphor for the centralized financial system) that captured all the universes in which Ricks were the smartest person in their respective universe, and built a closed off system within the infinite universe where these powerful Ricks abused Mortys and other Ricks - using them as expendable resources like labor, energy, or partners for adventures.

As a founding father, Rick C-137 assumed that everyone else would be stuck in this system forever. 

Until Evil Morty became President of the Citadel, he realized there was no way to fix the whole system since it was rigged against him. Evil Mortys only option was to escape the Central Finite Curve entirely. 

This might be the only time in the series that I can remember Rick getting outplayed. 

Even the protagonist Morty wouldn’t escape the system (leave his Rick) because the system makes him feel dependent on it. Evil Morty is the only Morty smart enough to understand why Mortys think they need Ricks, but he’s built different (kinda like Apes) so he leaves the system behind and warps out.

My take: The episode is a metaphor for GameStop leaving the fiat financial system (possibly even destroying it knowing there’s an infinite risk potential) and entering the world of decentralized finance. Wen GameStop NFT?",2021-09-13 00:12:12
csasker,"But then you again miss the point why people have a growing amount of argument against ETH, because they want to use, lets call it ETH/EVM style applications(or just blockchains, as seen now with Solana)  without much problem or cost, decentralization is not so very important for them. They see it from their perspective of what they want to use, not as some philosophical technological goal, and this is really not addressed by many ETH users or developers either in a good and friendly understanding way

And like I wrote in this several times and never got an answer to, decentralization is a range and not an absolute and this is another point that is widely ignored that good enough in software is usually what wins.

And it is solving things, since users like it more so it both solves scaling problems and solves how to onboard users who dont want to pay 100-200$ for a simple trade or even more for something like unstaking on Curve finance. This is in a way the same BTC maxi mindset, that they don't just realize how someone might be equally happy about using USDT or some XRP token for payments vs BTC, because its 100 vs 93% decentralization but in the end the user gets his product or service.",2021-09-13 04:23:59

I think you are going to have to decide if you are willing to take on the responsibility of providing for the both of you or not. It sounds like you guys are polar opposites from a finance perspective and that might not be a bad thing. Money is a necessary evil, be careful not to be ruled by it.

Being single with a fat bank account is also a very lonely place to be.

I am very thankful to my partner as she will always push the envelope and the budget and 95% of the time I am thankful for it, maybe not immediately but I always come round. Its about the journey and not only the destination, someone with different views and goals will provide you with balance. A partnership is exactly that, both people's needs and wants will need to be considered, not just the ones or the others.

Try not to plan to far ahead and if you do be a little more flexible. Plans seldom work out exactly the way you want them to, that is just life. This does not mean you should not plan, just don't get too upset if everything does not go according to said plan.

I think you are still fairly young, and you are still going to receive crazy curve balls, trust me on this one. They will make you feel like your plans are completely derailing. The main thing here is always remember, life is the thing that happens while we try and execute our plans and you don't get a 2nd chance.

pupuupup,"They are supply-demand APY.

When too many people put their liquidity in, but few people use it (swap the USDC to/from USDT), the APY will be very small.

But on the other hand, when few people provide liquidity and too many people use it (using swap on USDC-USDT pair), APY become big.

Sorry for bad English.

But it is all about supply-demand principle, usually newer LP pair will have high APY because the LP pool is still small.

And in addition to regular LP token, you are talking about Solfarm, which is a yield optimizer. It gives even more APY due to its strategy possibly auto-compounding strategy (I'm not sure what Solfarm do, but this is just basic concept of yield optimizer).

This means the 30% is not sustainable, but you can take advantage of it if you are early LP provider. But once Solana is more established and mature APY will start to look like the OG Defi on ETH (Curve Finance - Yearn Finance).

probabletrump,"So I'm going to attempt to give some answers. Please be gentle, if I leave something out or skip something I'm going to blame it on this being a less than ideal format (typing it out on my phone). Also, obligatory, this isn't tax advice or legal advice for anyone in particular, just a discussion about strategies that are typically attempted.

Alright so when we're talking cap gains we've got three types of folks. Those who are high wage earners (think 7 figures and up, athletes, execs, creatives), business owners, and real estate developers. Each have their own specific issues and strategies.

The high wage earners are the most straightforward. For them, if they work for a corporation I want to know their entire comp and benefit package. I'm usually looking for ways to avoid capital gains assets to begin with, Roth 401k are excellent places to out really risky assets, same with section 162 plans (cash value life insurance policies that the company funds at least partially). Both grow tax free and as long as you don't break a few rules, come out tax free. Getting a few $MM in these types of vehicles puts you way ahead of the curve. I personally make very good use of my Roth 401k. My riskiest investments go into it. My plan upon retirement is to use it to purchase a portfolio of vacation rentals and spend the rest of my life receiving that income tax free.

Beyond that, these folks tend to have a lot of liquid assets, strategies like tax loss harvesting and shifting around dividend reinvestment can prevent the need to sell assets and trigger a tax. In a year like this where we expect the capital gains tax to increase we tend to advise taking some strategic gains now while the tax is lower. The step up on basis and 1031 exchanges (also 1035 exchanges for the life insurance) can come in handy as well but I'll talk about those in the other categories.

For small business owners we're typically looking at very low basis and hopefully a much higher sales prices. If they sell the business to a third party there isn't a whole lot you can do about the capital gains. As with the previous example in a year like this there is a rush to get a deal done this year at a lower tax level but there will almost certainly be some tax owed. For those who want to sell but don't think they'll be able to this year they can look at taking out a large loan (think 100s of $MM) and paying a dividend out to all the owners. The first part of this cash would go to the owner as a return of their cost basis but anything over and above the basis would get taxed at this year's rate vs next year's. Then when the business is sold they'll recognize whatever gain is achieved over and above the dividend recap rate.

They could also consider transferring a portion of the company ownership to a charitable entity if they know they have charitable intent and they know they are going to sell the business. This allows them to avoid capital gains on the shares transferred to the charitable entity and also get a charitable deduction for the donation. This has some risk though in that it has to be done before a buyer is ""waiting in the wings"" and an S Corp isn't going to be able to have charitable ownership very long. If a sale doesn't materialize the business owner may need to come up with cash to buy the shares back from the charitable entity.

If they aren't selling to a third party they could create an ESOP and sell to their employees. If done correctly this could defer or eliminate capital gains tax for a seller. This is a big if though and shouldn't be attempted without a team who specializes in ESOPs.

There is also a transfer to family members. In this case the owner of the company keeps it their entire life and upon death leaves it to their family. At death the company gets a step up in basis meaning no capital gains tax owed. I've seen a business started in the first generation's garage that 40 years later had a cost basis of $20MM sell immediately after the first gens death for $750MM and the heirs paid no capital gains tax. Couple that with some aggressive life insurance planning earlier in life to cover the estate taxes and the business owner can get away for only the cost of the interest on the life insurance premium finance scheme that bought the life insurance. Typically a tiny fraction of the cost of the tax avoided. Especially at the interest rates we have now.

Finally for the real estate guys the 1031 exchange coupled with the step up in basis I mentioned earlier is a pretty sweet deal. RE guy buys a plot of land and develops it. This land is now worth significantly more. If he sold it he would be paying capital gains on most of the sales price (think gains of $40MM - $50MM). If instead he develops the land and then sells it and elects to do a 1031 exchange, he can find his next development target, maybe do multiple projects, and pick up new properties with those funds without having to pay a capital gain at that time. The gain is deferred and rolled over to the new property. The idea being that eventually it will get sold and a lifetime of gains from real estate development will come due. If this guy dies though with that property in his name it gets a step up in basis. His heirs can sell it and avoid taxes on all of the gain on all of the properties going as far back as the original developer was able to keep the 1031 exchanges rolling.",2021-09-14 06:35:05
hooliganb,"The ROI on brand is challenging to measure because it’s a long game. Brand isn’t marketing, and if you find an agency that treats it as such, then you’re going to be going with the wrong agency. 

The benefit of brand is attracting more customers to come back more often for more money over time. It isn’t the immediate results of marketing. You need to create a tribe of believers, and that requires nurturing your audience.

Then timeline as well. If you enter into the process deciding you’re going to measure success based on who will do it the quickest… again, you’re going to fail. Timeline isn’t a metric of who will do it the best. It is a metric for who is willing do abbreviate their process the most to hopefully get you something viable to launch with. 

Someone else had it right when they said the best way to understand whether someone is the best is the questions they ask. You want them to know who your audience is, what your goals are, what your metric for success is, your challenges, where you envision the business going, and what would it mean for you to achieve success.

Likewise, I believe you also want to connect with the people you meet with as humans. You’re going to find greater success with an agency is interested in who you are as people and forming a connection with you. Brand strategy involves a lot of discovery and they’ll likely want to perform research and interviews. If you don’t choose an agency that “feels” right, that could be a tough process. 

Lastly, depending on your industry, there’s something to be said for niching down. Some agencies have specialty in specific industries, and it may be significant to you that you work with someone with relevant experience. It doesn’t mean a generalist won’t do amazing work for you (and someone with an outsider perspective might be able to innovate more easily), but there are some fields (healthcare, finance, investment) where there’s a bigger learning curve if you don’t have previous experience.",2021-09-14 07:42:09

Mista_3_14159,"Permettez moi de m'exprimer en anglais, je suis plus a l'aise.

The Bank of Canada (BoC) has been, and continues to be one of the larger net buyers of Government of Canada bonds in the secondary market through it's quantitative easing program. In normal times, the BoC intervenes in the front end of the yield curve through repo and reverse repo operations to keep the overnight rate at the target rate, adding or limiting supply of reserves in the banking sector. In normal times, the bank controls rates out to roughly 2yrs through the conventionally policy, however with QE, the Bank was able to control rates out to Long bonds, thus artificially keeping rates low and allowing governments to issues large amount of longer term debt, which will help grow the number of dollars outstanding

&amp;#x200B;

In March 2020, the BoC unleashed a suite of unconventional (yet necessary) policy tools to help easy the financial markets, notably, Quantitative easing, but also notably and also likely of a much consequence, the purchase of BAs, and offering up term repos. The reason for this was that in March 2020, the Canadian bond market was broken, notably, Ontario had a failed Tbill auction, (Quebec as well if memory serves) and other provinces were completely locked out of short term funding markets.

&amp;#x200B;

The BoC thus stepped into funding markets to get it going again, and also offered up Term repos and allowed the banks to issue covered bonds that were purchased by their own treasury then put out as collateral for term repos, and a large portion of the proceeds were then used to buy provincial bonds as carve outs, and really get funding markets going. The secondary impact of that (besides making hundreds of millions for the banks in their AFS books)  was the rapid growth of our monetary base (M2). 

&amp;#x200B;

So to an extant, /u/Bewaretheicespiders is correct that the BoC is responsible for the availability of dollars. The purchases of government bonds have an strong indirect linkage to the growth of our monetary base. However, as seen in the US and in Japan with multiple QE programs, QE doesn't necessarily imply M2 growth. What blew up M2 was the combination of unconventional monetary policy and expansionary fiscal policy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would further highlight that the BoC is not an issuer in that the bonds are the liability of the Government of Canada. The BoC does facilitate the auctions of the behalf of the Minister of Finance. Furthermore they are only a seller in the way a banking syndicate is the seller of a cooperate new issue. They do not sell into the secondary market, only the primary through the auction process. It is thus disingenuous to speak of the BoC as a buyer and a seller.",2021-09-14 09:24:17
BloodyAlien243,"I don’t think the idea is a good one. Rebellions are almost always small, so they lack the logistics and resources to research, finance, build, train, and deploy more advanced technology than the much larger government they are fighting. If they could, then they wouldn’t be small, and wouldn’t really be a rebellion. 
In modern war, it’s not quite about who has the fanciest toys, though that is a very big advantage. War is mostly about being able to produce enough adequate stuff to fight back the enemy. 
The Nazis in WW2 were in many ways more advanced and ahead of the curve in WW2. Better tanks, more advanced tactics, jet aircraft, advanced in weapons technology, and even nuclear technology. However, they lacked the resources to keep the war effort growing. Metals like iron, chromium, and tungsten were all gathered from neutral nations instead of Germany itself. Oil was also a big one. They also were losing key industrial sites, while the Allies had a secure industrial machine in the US. 

Despite the Nazis being way ahead, especially in science, they lacked the logistics and resources to use the tech they developed. And you know what happened to all those nazi scientists? Operation Paperclip. The US and USSR scooped them up as fast as they could. Werner von Braun, one these scientists, played a key role in the moon landing. 

So I don’t think the idea of a rebellion having more advanced technology that an Empire they are fighting is all that accurate and probably  isn’t a good idea.",2021-09-14 10:43:24
Throwaway2874637,"This is actually a tough question...

Investing itself I think anyone can do. Anyone can put their money into an index fund and earn 8-10% annually without having to do anything (Which I'd actually highly recommend. If communism means that all property is owned by the community, then that's about the closest you'll get for now as you'll be part owner of a whole basket of companies)

As for trying to actively invest... the thing is, I do think that anyone could.. but then there's a reason why most people don't. 

If they don't have enough money to invest in companies, I would suggest using real estate to build the wealth first as you can really leverage your dollars. Save enough for a down payment, buy a rental and as long as it cashflows you're good... And then once they have enough wealth (It doesn't even have to be that much, $300k could do it if they can live below their means) then they can go into stocks if they want.

It does require a lot of patience and emotional control. There is a learning curve and it'll require a lot of reading financial statements and listening to boring conference calls. They would have to be comfortable with putting their money into limbo and not touching it for an extended period of time. Jeff Bezos is currently worth $200B but he doesn't have $200B to spend. 

So I think everyone ""could"" do it but then I'm sure a computer programmer would say anyone can learn to code... There's no way I'd have the willpower to learn to code like how most people just wouldn't have the willpower to learn about finance. It requires someone to be interested in business and they'll continuously learn along the way. I've been doing this since I was 18 and I'm still learning new things every day. lol apologies for the long reply but I hope this answers your question.",2021-09-14 18:42:22

AtraActa,"The hardest part is seeing the endgame and actually getting a feel for accounting. College and University level accounting courses are for the most part - fodder. They really don't give you an idea of what it's like in the job, whether that's industry or audit. 

The issue with the courses is that everything is starting from scratch whereas when you actually get a job, the company has templates and models that are already in place. So you can get an idea for the moving parts a lot better because you don't need to sit there doing T-charts or worry about the consolidation elimination entry.

Bank recs are a chore in class, consolidation is a chore is class. In the real world Bank recs are very simple and actually somewhat enjoyable. Consolidation is much more straight forward than it is in class, where you're forced to memorize the consol formula and all that junk.

This is  even more true in Advanced finance and Advanced accounting, because the opening concepts to begin these problems from scratch is more difficult than the meat and potato's of the question - usually. Once you get into a job it's much easier to put the skills together and you will feel you make a lot more progress at a much higher speed.

Willing_Fig_9235,"Hi OP,

Its wonderful that you're developing an interest in finance. An actuarial path is considerably different from a finance pathway (depending on where you land up).

At your age i would focus on keeping up with the markets, yields/yield curves, macro. Leave the portfolio formation for a later stage. The more you focus on those 3 factors, the more likely you are to receive an answer to your question. 

Try to google what a yield curve is, how it looks and why. 
What is convexity? (Fucking magic trust me)

At such an early stage i would consciously push you away from the complexity of derivatives, but thats what got me interested in finance in the first place. So you look like you have a mathematical bend, google the following and try to understand what they mean

-Collateralized Debt Obligations
-Collateralized Loan Obligations
-Mortgage Backed Securities
-Synthetic CDO

PS this topic is a rabbit hole. Dont get too deep yet. Stick to these 4 and try to visualize what they mean for 1) lenders 2) economic policy 3) regulation 4) retail investors (such as yourself). You also need to consider institutional investors. But skip that for now, thats a beast you can tackle another day.

Keep your eye on the macro end of things for now, i know a few forums might be pushing you towards understanding hedge funds/fund of funds/alternatives. That is knowledge that is fairly easily graspable. First decide if you want to do this, because its considerably more competitive than actuarials. 

As for the CFA, extremely useful, dont worry about study guides and the nay-sayers. Head up to their website and check out what they teach, its fairly detailed knowledge about things you would certainly need in a career in finance.

Hope to see you in the jungle old sport.

Lifeisagarden_Digit,"I agree, and the user experience on bitcoin certainly has more work to be done in both usability and security for the average person. The capability is there, but it is definitely still easier to use the dollar currently due to it's entrenched position. However, the competition between them is not about what one is more convenient but what one is more functional as a monetary communication medium from a fundamental perspective over long periods of time without requiring trust in a third party.

1. The selling point is not that if you use bitcoin you will magically be able to secure it with no effort. the selling point is that it is the single asset that is MOST securable. No other asset or currency even comes close to the security of bitcoin, they do not even have to potential to in the first place. No matter how sloppy people in aggregate are, it will still be more secure than anything currently being used with the optionality to individually increase security to approach the mathematical limit if one so chooses. This optionality does not exist anywhere else
2. All financial activity is already required to be reported when dealing in assets and currencies, it's already a pain in the ass. The only reason it's easier for the dollar system is because the system is already built not because it is easier in the absolute sense. The open nature of the block chain and the ability to securely and instantly audit anything on it at any time programmatically will allow for much easier tax reporting. there is a company called TaxBit already pushing in that direction.
3. True, very few are tech savvy. they won't need to be though. People don't know how any of the tech they use works and most never will. The capabilities the tech provides are still present though, and as the ecosystem develops all the features will be simplified and knowledge of possible actions will spread to the general populace whether they know how it works under the hood or not. The internet and cell phone adoption trends show this, the same will occur in the evolution of cryptographic financial networking. Many bitcoin wallets already have a bigass ""Privacy mode"" button or other things like it. No understanding or knowledge required at that point and it's only going to get easier and more capable over time as adoption continues and development advances.
4. Again, this argument stems from the user experience. The uneducated, the trusting, and the foolish alike are all already extremely vulnerable in the dollar system. Using bitcoin will improve this and reduce vulnerability even if it doesn't eliminate it. As this value becomes more pronounced more will use it over the competition and eventually social pressures begin the S-curve adoption trend seen in all technological change. Finance in general has fraud and some are vulnerable, but there is less as a percentage in bitcoin if you look at the raw statistics and the trend is only going down. The simple acceptance of bitcoin is the thing you need to worry least about as a vendor in fact, public key addresses are meant to be broadcast. Tesla's bitcoin stance is something I have kept an eye on, I was formerly an investor in them as well. They stopped accepting it as payment because BlackRock, one of their largest shareholders, was concerned about ESG requirements. that's a whole other can of worms, but suffice to say it has nothing to do with its reliability or worth as a mechanism for accepting payment. Additionally, Test did not sell any of their $1+ billion dollars in bitcoin so clearly they still think it has a future. Institutional adoption trends are currently rising exponentially. Even if Tesla and Elon Musk came out full swing and said bitcoin is the worst thing ever it wouldn't reverse this trend. the banks and hedge funds are arriving and they don't give a fuck what the news says.
5. Bitcoin has many purposes and solves many problems, if none spring to mind for you that does not imply they do not exist. Block chain is not the most useful part of bitcoin, ask anyone that knows the tech itself instead of the narrative in the mainstream. block chain has been around since the 90's and so has all the other tech that makes up the protocol like Elliptic curve cryptography or the SHA256 hash function. The breakthrough is in the solving of the 'byzantine general problem' in computer science and applying that to a public ledger based monetary system to eliminate the need for trust in reaching consensus on the state of property rights within the economic system. It's finite supply backed by proof-of-work eliminates the cost of inflation which destroys an estimated %12 of global wealth creation annually. It completely disintermediates most of the rent-seeking institutions that scrape wealth off the top of everything in the economy. There are others but I don't want to write an essay here, least not anymore than I have already lol. The government can do what they like and take what ideas they like, but the core problems that bitcoin solves are ones that benefit them and that they perpetuate. so anything they invent from these technological elements will be fundamentally different in form and function from bitcoin whether it uses block chains or not. Nothing any public entity says or does will do anything but temporarily slow bitcoin down and cause that government to miss out on an opportunity to actually serve it's people instead of exploit them through monetary manipulation. When an alternative like bitcoin exists the contrast will force competition like has never happened before and they cannot stop it like they did with physical assets such as gold in the past.

This is true, though I don't much care for the sheep analogy personally I know what you mean and generally agree with the sentiment. However, like with all other technological transformations bitcoin does not require that every person that uses it understand why it's useful or how it works. It only matters that it IS more useful and that it DOES work better. Wealth stored in Fiat and assets denominated in Fiat constantly lose value over time where as bitcoin is the opposite. It's literally just supply and demand. Over time those that hold finite scarce assets like bitcoin or land will win out over those that hold their wealth in the dollar ecosystem where there is no supply cap and its always increasing exponentially in volume and depreciating in purchasing power as a select few abuse the power of seigniorage, whether they understand why or not.",2021-09-17 02:32:47
AwesomeHatManNZ,"The idea that everyone should pass university...

It's not that a certain percentage must be made to fail because ""the curve"" or anything silly like that. Some people shouldn't get a pass because they just can't do it

If you're on a plane, you're going to want your pilot to know how to fly.
If you have a legal issue, you'll want your lawyer to know how to practice law.

BoxerRumbleEJ257,"Two considerations need to be made here:

1. Interest rate. Longer term loans typically means a higher rate. Depending on the difference, that can not be an issue. Some manufacturers offer 0% financing for 60+ months at times (not sure how many are doing it now with the vehicle shortage). There's something to be said about investing the ""extra"" money saved on shorter-tem finance payments in a higher-yielding avenue. You might get burned if you have to pull out at a bad time (e.g., you're investing in equities and there's a market decline), but historically, you're going to be better off assuming the interest rate on your loan is low enough.
2. Vehicle depreciation. Typically, vehicles with long-term financing can end up under water in terms of the value vs remaining loan balance due to the depreciation curve. This only really comes into play when it's time to buy the next vehicle (e.g., total insurance loss, personal choice replacement, etc.). Assuming you wouldn't be floating this underwater balance onto a new vehicle (and continuing / compounding the issue), this isn't a major concern. In your situation, you mention you could pay for the vehicle in cash, so I'm assuming you could cover the balance, but this is more meant as generic advice for anyone in the situation.",2021-09-17 11:39:08
deeseabee,"So many reasons why it's unlikely to shake out at $75/lb. And I say that not to be a dik, more that it's an incredibly opaque and complex market. Four things I'd add.

""What if every utility company inks their long term deal now, causing the price per pound to go to $75 as everything shakes out."" - it takes two to tango. For every buyer there has to be a seller. Some producers might be willing to sell some of their future lbs at that price, but certainly not all of it as they'd be putting a ceiling on their profitability. Most I'd argue will see how it's ran to $75, think to themselves the price can still run higher so hold out longer. This is a major concern some investors have with holding the producers - that they'll ink deals too early.

The other thing is the way the contracts are negotiated. No deal between between a buyer (utility) and seller (a uranium miner) is a simple deal for X lbs at Y price for Z years. They have floors and ceilings, where say 40% will be sold at an agreed price (say 75 bucks as per your scneario) and the remaining 60% at prevailing market spot price. Structuring contracts this way gives utilities some safety with the 40 and the miner the potential upside with the 60. (This is of course a massive over-simplification and it will differ for all the producers and developers, I hear some of these contracts can run into the hundreds of pages lol)

Thirdly, as others have said there's not only enough uranium in the short term with SPUT and the like gobbling it all up, but there's a structural deficit at play that means there's still very little lbs for years to come even once the mines on C&amp;M come back online. Producers who can get back to producing in the next 18-24 months - and that's a best case scenario - still can't come close to meeting the demand in 5 years let alone ten. And LT contracts typically run 3-7, up to ten years. The whole sector needs new supply to come on. DNN and others like GLO might be able to get finance to build a mine with $75/lb offtake agreements, but if you believe the modelling, the sector needs developers at the higher end of the cost curve to come online also. And they won't be producers at $75, more like $90 or $100. 

Finally, what happens when sovereigns like CCP or India or possibly the French or Russians acquire these developers so they can ensure supply for their own nuclear programs? The US utilities need far more than they can get domestically and KAP is running out and under the Russian sphere of influence. So this'll put further pressure on utes to hopefully pay more to developers so the developers can resist takeovers from sovereign buyers (not that many developers even want to become producers who manage a mine which only complicates the situation further)

Or of course, the Taliban could attack a pakistan nuclear plant to try and trigger another regional conflagration and the nuclear sector goes into another freefall and the price plummets back to $30/lb. There's just no knowing some things!",2021-09-17 16:40:49

ArcadesOfAntiquity,"I used Pickle a while back and I don't plan on using it again.

Point 1. Ask yourself: ""Where exactly are these super high APRs coming from?""

The answer is, from the liquidity of people who lock less (or no) PICKLE.

Pickle takes a cut of your yield every time it auto-compounds, and you'd better believe they have an incentive to use some of that cut to buy PICKLE on the open market in order to make sure its price stays at the point that it makes the PICKLE rewards high enough to retain and attract liquidity to fuel their future cuts.

Another factor that contributes to ensuring that the price of PICKLE stays high enough to incentivize jar deposits, is people who lock PICKLE, thus removing sell pressure from the market. Those who lock more PICKLE are rewarded with a greater share of the total PICKLE issuance.

Here's where the problem becomes clear: imagine if everyone using Pickle owned enough PICKLE to get the max advertised APR. In that case, ~~to maintain the present APRs,~~ one of two things would have to happen: either 1) the rate of PICKLE issuance would have to increase or 2) APRs would have to go down.

The only way both of those are avoided is if there is a sufficient amount of liquidity in the jars from people who are not locking much PICKLE.

Point 2. Check the math on just how much PICKLE you'd have to buy/farm before you could get the max advertised APRs. It varies depending on the jar, but it's usually in the neighborhood of six figures (USD) worth, and that's only sufficient to get the max APR if you're willing to lock that PICKLE for four years (!).

Okay, so people who got in early (by farming PICKLE) or with higher initial outlay (to buy PICKLE) are getting more rewards, sounds like pretty standard stuff in crypto or in finance generally right? Notably, Curve's incentive structure seems at least fairly similar.

The thing to ask then is, ""What's the reward difference between people who are locking no PICKLE vs people who are locking the max APR amount?""

Compare with the reward differences on Curve. In my opinion Pickle's is just too big. That gap is a measurement of how much large PICKLE holders are profiting at the expense of small/no PICKLE holders. Remember that regardless of how much PICKLE you hold, Pickle takes its cut of your yield and uses it to buy PICKLE on the open market. Are those buys supporting the value of your bags? Only if you're already a large PICKLE holder.

My explanation might not be the clearest but hopefully you can see there's a slight hint of ponzi. It's not really a ponzi because the autocompound does provide an actual useful service and as far as I know you can profit from this service even when you lock no PICKLE. I just think it's weighted too much in favor of current PICKLE holders. I think maybe they can adjust this via a vote, which leads me to...

Conclusion: does an autocompounder, which is after all a simple financial concept, really merit the kinds of APRs that are received by large PICKLE lockers?

My answer is, maybe, but only while defi/blockchain is new enough that autocompounders aren't seen as basic perks.

There will come a day when services like Yearn and Pickle look like dinosaurs because they ""only"" do autocompounding--and for a hefty cut of your profits.

A few other little notes:

1) Look in the discord and search for something like D4 lower return. There are people complaining that the actual return of the D4 saddle pool jar is significantly lower than advertised.

2) The site is a bit janky, and not in the hiccup-y way that is common on web3 sites (though of course it has that too), but in a more basic, ""not using best web design practices"" way.

Scared_Watercress540,"I waited about 10wks for verification for my Ruby in March. Once verified my card took about another 10 days from memory. Upgraded to Jade yesterday so am interested to see what the timeframes are like this time around.  The initial wait aside, I have nothing but good things to say about CDC. With my stake and a decent portion of my holdings in Earn I'm now getting about 7.5% APY across my stacks. I finally feel like my crypto is working for me on the daily, rather than just being locked up until it moons. Not to mention the cashback CRO on virtually all my expenses. 

Helps to remember that this is still a fairly new space and CDC has had some huge growth in the last 12mths which could account for some delays.

SwagtimusPrime,"&gt;Cardano is designed as a groundbreaking blockchain platform, comparable to ETH 2.

Only after Hydra goes live or you'll be stuck with 100-200 TPS. In its current shape, Cardano is everything but groundbreaking.

&gt;Charles is named by Vitalik as one of the 4 core Ethereum team members here as early as 2014:

&gt;https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/01/23/ethereum-now-going-public/

&gt;So you claim Charles Hoskinson left ETH 1, to work on another ETH 1 with zero improvements whatsoever?

&gt;That the IOHK team research and spent countless hours just to build another ETH 1?

&gt;Lol

I didn't say anything like this. I just pointed out that Ethereum is working and has been for years, whereas Cardano hasn't and in its current form offers no significant improvements over Ethereum. By significant I mean groundbreaking improvements. Not 100-200 TPS. Not babel fee gimmicks that can be done on rollups as well, or different programming languages that can be done on rollups as well.

&gt;What is even there on rollups? Nothing, just the same old farms and shitcoin ponzi casinos. Can you name any really great dapp on rollup that is nearing world adoption that is presently deployed on an Ethereum roll up?

Arbitrum has Curve, Balancer, Cream, DAI, Dopex, Sushiswap, Uniswap - oh, there you go. Uniswap is definitely an app that's nearing world adoption and it's on rollups. Did you know that Uniswap is in talks with Paypal, Robinhood and Stripe to see how they can implement AMM technology into their businesses? Now you know: https://beincrypto.com/leaked-video-suggests-uniswap-in-talks-with-paypal-robinhood/

&gt;Yeah, they are pumping out ponzi schemes, rug pulls, inconsequential shitcoin casinos and ""farms"", so much that the whole space is synonymous with a gaint pyramid scheme to anyone looking from outside.

This is a very narrow view. Do you have any idea how many people can now permissionlessly lend and borrow assets without having to rely on banks? Do you know how many people in third world countries can now earn 3-10% on their crypto or stablecoins without middlemen or corrupt governments? But I'm sure it's all just one giant scam and Charles Hoskinson has the magic ability to build some actual useful stuff. Sit down, be humble. You don't know shit.

&gt;You can literally count the real world valuable projects on ETH and its rollups in one hand. Projects that can actually be used for real world transactions and not just a giant scam operated from their home by programmers.

May I introduce you to the baseline protocol: https://docs.baseline-protocol.org/

https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/08/26/boring-is-the-new-exciting-how-baseline-protocol-connected-with-600-corporates/

&gt;The protocol has seen prolific adoption since its launch in March of this year. Wolpert said some 20 or so companies a week are joining the 600-plus firms now using the protocol, with big names like Coca-Cola bottling group Coke One North America recently joining. 

Coca Cola, EY, and many more already use it, it's spearheaded by Microsoft, Ernst&amp;Young, Accenture, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, ConsenSys, Chainlink, etc etc. Due to EY's influence, it is poised to be used by **a lot** of Fortune 500 companies.

EY is also building a zk rollup on Ethereum for their business usecases: https://www.ey.com/en_gl/news/2021/07/ey-contributes-a-zero-knowledge-proof-layer-2-protocol-into-the-public-domain-to-help-address-increasing-transaction-costs-on-ethereum-blockchain

&gt;“Based on EY experience, ZK-Optimistic roll-ups are currently among the most effective in balancing security incentives and mathematical efficiency for running private transactions on the public Ethereum network.  As we have in the past, we are again contributing this code into the public domain to speed up enterprise adoption of this technology.”

And this is just one of many usecases. People in the Philippines play Axie Infinity for a living due to the Play2Earn model. Axie Infinity is among the biggest discord groups **worldwide**.

Edit: May I also introduce you to the Gamestop NFT project? https://nft.gamestop.com/

There are lots of rumors floating around what it could be, but one thing is for sure: They are building their business on Ethereum and NFTs have the power to completely revolutionize how games are sold and resold - it has the potential to unseat Steam.

I'm sure it's all just scams and ponzis, and Charles will descend from the heavens to save us from decentralized finance, NFTs, games and enterprise adoption to strike another deal with some third world country so the Cardano maxis can laud it as a huge sign of adoption and success. No. Adoption happens organically.",2021-09-18 20:22:24
Glass_Win_2724,"People need to stop calling crypto gambling, because it's simply not. A gambler making stupid decisions is gambling. Crypto, is a marketplace, just like any other - and has it pitfalls, but also huge advantages. If you understand the science behind crypto and it's cultural impact, you'll know. I know people that are total idiots when it comes to investing but also a lot of people I really look up to. Put simply, it is a legitimate tool to make money &amp; you can make some ape returns right now since it is a hot market. Crypto trading, in essence, takes the power away from traditional ""money"", that's why we see NFTs and meme coins generating millions and millions of dollars. We are evacuating consumerist bullshit. I don't think I want to see the world go in any other direction, because in essence Corporate giants (especially traditional banks, which are just giant tech companies in disguise) have been fucking people over since the beginning of time, and now, the pendulum is finally swinging the other way. We've created our own financial marketplace, and it has almost zero to do with bureaucratic banks or giant public companies. In the end, it is a philosophical fight, the young world is more interested in digital rather than physical. Less consumerism, less waste, less cars, less commutes, less overall bullshit that society implies on us.

Whether or not it's gambling, is entirely dependent on on you and your own strategy - you can say anything is gambling. And there are a lot of gamblers that win too. I'm not recommending this, but in crypto it's never been easier to win as a gambler. I'd say in a lot of scenarios, a young person with no direction getting into crypto is the best possible thing to happen (if you are in the right mindset) being smart, disciplined, and having some balls - can pay amazing dividends. And the crypto community is not only so huge but also helpful to beginners, it really feels like everyone is winning, especially when you see someone go from a shitty, dead-end job to living a comfortable life without having to clock in or put up with bullshit that they don't deserve in the first place. It is really levelling the playing field for everyone. After the long learning curve and hours of study, you don't need to put too much time into it, your most effective trades, ideally only take anywhere from 15 mins to half an hour once you get a hang of the market and how/what you want to trade (your niche, so to speak). It's not about getting rich bro. It's about becoming free from the chains of society as hippy and bullshit as that sounds. If you can make the minimum amount of money to sustain yourself on your own, I think everyone would take that over employment - and I think it's actually what's best for everyone as human beings. The less you do, the more you do. After this, it's up to you if you wanna be rich or not. but at least you'll know, that you'll be good - and have enough money to buy things you want, enough time to spend for yourself, if you want you can stay at home 7 days a week and watch anime, but most importantly financial freedom (actually, the lack of pressure from it, the word financial freedom shouldn't even exist because it implies we need intrinsic monetary value to live freely, but I also understand that freedom comes with responsibility) will enable you to be more of a kind and empathetic person to yourself and the world instead of submitting to rat race work culture and consumerist bullshit. This is the important shit, change the finance game so a young kid growing up poor with all the odds stacked against them doesn't have to feel like shit looking at people who have always had it better than him, but actually has an easy way out. hard work and ""pulling yourself up by the bootstraps"" is an extremely overrated sentiment. sorry for the long tirade but I'm passionate about this stuff",2021-09-19 00:37:29

vinn_47,"I did the same course for my bachelors from DU and appeared for multiple Masters entrances, including the ones you mentioned. For IIT JAM, there are coachings in which you can enroll from 4th semester onwards. If you are good in problem solving and statistics, you can crack it without any coaching too. Regarding ISI M.Stat entrance, they don't ask questions from too advanced or difficult topics; they ask questions from general topics only, but they are tricky and good problem solving skills are required to solve those. Same goes for CMI entrance. You don't need to focus on these exams right from the beginning; just study the college syllabus for now, and start focusing on these exams from 4th or 5th semester. 

For MBA, you ideally need to appear for CAT. You should start preparing atleast one year in advance. Most of my friends started preparing from 3rd or 4th semester. Whether you'll need coaching depends entirely on you. If you start preparing well in advance, I don't think there is much need for coaching; just buy some good mock test series (IMS or TIME will do).

For abroad, it depends a lot on whether you get some scholarship/funding or not, and also on which country you go to. It's better to get some counselling for that or directly ask someone who went abroad for masters.

&amp;#x200B;

Other than Masters, you can go for a job in data science or analytics, although competition will be a bit tough since generally B.Tech or Masters candidates are preferred for such jobs. But if you have good skills and a good profile, it is definitely possible.  

Other than data science, you can go for jobs in fields like marketing, consulting or finance if that interests you.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, don't burden yourself with multiple internships. Only do an internship if you find it interesting; many of my batch mates did sales/marketing interships just for the sake of doing an internship. Such internships are of little use, and I don't think they are worth it. Even one internship is fine if it is good and has a steep learning curve.

&amp;#x200B;

For now, you can start learning some machine learning and deep learning (from online resources). Start making projects (they will help you later on) or maybe participate in Kaggle competitions if you find them interesting. Also, read research papers once you are comfortable enough with ML/DL theory. But apart from these do focus on basic statistics concepts you are taught in your syllabus; they are important if you want to clear these Masters entrances. 

Apart from this, I would suggest to do some extra curriculars and explore what interests you; you won't get much time for that later on.",2021-09-20 01:00:37

throwaway474673637,"Excuse me for not being able to see the future when I replied to you about your original point on LTTs. Of all the many mistakes I’ve made talking to people here about finance and investing, that one is probably the worst.

You’re right that bonds are generally non-correlated to stocks (though credit tends to be positively correlated to stocks because stocks and corporate bonds represent claims on the same corporate assets), but your original point was that LTTs are the *only* non correlated assets to stocks, which is just plain wrong. I’m not sure why you’re trying to make a big deal about 0.02 difference in stock market correlations between LTTs and STTs. You can play around with the start and end dates of these backtests and get small differences in either directions (ie look at just the last 20 years and the results slightly favour STTs) but they really don’t matter. As my original comment stated, Treasurys all along the yield curve (short, intermediate, long) have similar correlations to stocks.

I studied molecular &amp; cellular biology &amp; have one bio stock I’m pretty confident in long term growth &amp; price stability. But I follow it closely &amp; not married to any stock bec any dominant company can always be overtaken by new innovation by its competition. If you are not an expert in any industry, Subscribe to an industry specific publication (ie auto, logistics, biotech, finance, oil, aviation, real estate magazine, etc). Know statistics, &amp; memories important statistics. I for one know 1 in 10 jobs is directly related to car industry, 1 in 20 jobs is directly related to oil industry, virtually ALL jobs are related to housing industry (hence the world housing financial crisis). Know the big players in each industry. Knowing profit margins will let you know who will outlast a crash &amp; who will default first (Saudi Arabia had highest profit margin for oil, Venezuela had lowest profit margin for oil, hence the collapse of highly un-diversified, oil dependent Venezuela) And FOLLOW &amp; UNDERSTAND the YIELD CURVE!!! Prices of Bonds vs Equities tend to be affected by changes in yield curve in significant ways (the fear injected by wallstreet of steeping yield curve has turned out to be wrong so far but the fear still lingers in retail investors bec they don’t follow bonds or the yield curve, they primarily follow equities(stocks)).

I Determine how much the world trusts the fed chair &amp; how much I trust the fed chair. So far seems world generally trusts Powell. I will keep my opinion of Powell to myself, but I will say Yellen was a better communicator. There is a lot of money that can be made by investing in renewables &amp; going green. (Dems talk about it but I don’t trust they actually want to do it) Mostly bec 1 in 20 jobs is linked to oil &amp; it would be hugely disruptive at first but anyone investing in renewables would see their bank accounts soar &amp; bank accounts of oil industry tank after dust settles. And Manchin is in a coal dominated state &amp; big coal has strong ties to big oil. Oil companies hire the best, so these people would switch to work for renewables industry. Like I said , it would be highly disruptive to markets &amp; particularly disruptive to oil dependent counties Iike Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia. Same people shorting AMC &amp; GME are also the one’s shorting renewables has been my conclusion. Hedge funds must be highly invested in oil &amp; banks that fund oil.

&gt; Do you think CSUN is the place for at least [any finance job in LA]?

To directly answer your question, yes - CSUN can get you to that goal. There are many CSUN alums working in ""at least any finance job"" in LA and elsewhere. So the trends of ""at least getting a finance job"" is favorable, especially since there is campus recruiting for a variety of back-office finance roles at banks, finance-oriented compliance roles at the accounting firms, and FP&amp;A roles at companies.

If I were to leave any sort of advice, don't feel like there are jobs at any role, at any company, no matter the competitiveness, the prestige, the barriers, etc. that you feel you cannot get. I truly feel that if you want to strive for the best, and if that best for is IB/WM (or even Private Equity, Venture Capital, Hedge Funds, Management Consulting, etc.), you shouldn't settle for anything less because of attending CSUN or any other factors (i.e. first generation, low income, etc.). While I do think students should try to prioritize going to target schools to minimize the barriers of entry to these roles, that's not to say CSUN students cannot break out of what is the norm at CSUN and pursue their dream careers. You too can make the 150k out of college moving markets working in New York City/Wall Street in high finance and equally as deserve it than any other student from a ""better"" school.

trimtab28,"2020 and 2016 are a bit of a curve ball given the polarity of Donald Trump, and thus down ticket races. Look at the state level elections though- Texas state level seats have increasingly gone to Republicans since the early 2000s, with a dip once Trump came into office. That speaks to the polarizing power of the man, not really demographics. Not to speak of the reality that Trump did in fact manage to garner more Republican votes than his predecessor. Whether or not Texas goes blue begs the question of how the GOP positions itself (more Trumpist or not), working class minority voter patterns (which actually start skewing conservative when the Democratic Party increasingly caters to the college educated), and the extent to which outsiders are assimilating into the political culture of their adopted states (which I pointed out- many people go from California because they don't want to be in California, outstayed though the exodus may be).

https://ballotpedia.org/Texas\_House\_of\_Representatives

The snowbird mentality, ""moving to a state because we like the political culture and thus will reinforce it"" actually is pretty illustrative of my point. And it's similar to Texas demographically insofar as you get conservatives from blue states consciously moving in due to the political culture. Plus the gravitation of Latinos towards Republicans due to social conservatism is present in both Miami and the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, if you're unaware of the latter. The two states actually did have voter shifts that roughly mirror each other (and inextricably do when you start looking at specific groups like Latinos). And countering your point on the tech companies, Florida has for some time had a reasonable tech scene due to defense contractors, plus there's been a shift due to low taxes there of tech and finance companies. Not to the same clip of Texas, but without a doubt it exists.

Jawls19881,"Unless you can can get a very generous dealer contribution on the finance, then the cheapest option is virtually always:

- pay cash
- if can’t afford cash, then get an unsecured bank loan. Check rates here via manufacturer finance etc

But, here you’d trading low average cost for unpredictable costs (car might need maintenance so, costs are lumpy etc). With leasing or PCP on a new car, you’re getting predictable costs in return for higher average costs.

Also, not really fair to compare a Kia to a VW. They’re at different price/prestige points in the market. 

If you plan on switching the car after 3 years etc, this will almost never be rational from a personal finance point of view. This is because if you own the car for longer, you will get down to flatter parts of the depreciation curve. If you always lease new cars etc, you are always on the steeper parts of the curve. Exceptions here are if you’re willing to have unpopular models / colours that the manufacturers need to shift.",2021-09-23 19:57:47

Link from my blog [The Rise of the Professional Class](http://greyenlightenment.com/2021/09/02/the-rise-of-the-professional-class/)

Due to a combination of strong asset returns, low interest rates, low inflation (which magnifies real returns and increases purchasing power), and high wages, the past decade has been especially good for for professionals compared to earlier decades, possibly ever.

Wages for professionals, such as in law, medicine, tech, finance, consulting, etc., have really surged over the past decade, since 2008 especially, even after accounting for student loan debt and inflation. 

https://d1x7qj5rlh2e19.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/09154235/Chart1_Prior-to-COVID-median-earnings-for-recent-grads-reached-record-highs-1024x715.png

(this was plotted before Covid, but there is no reason to expect it has changed, and if anything Covid has only widened the gap between the professional class and everyone else)

Even after accounting for student loan debt , college grads still come out well-ahead of non-grads. Although high school grads have a four-year head start in terms of employment compared to college grads, this is probably offset by the worse job prospects and high unemployment for high school grads compared to college grads (college grads have 50% lower unemployment rate compared to non-grads).  It's not like companies are clamoring for high school grads unless they can pay them very little.  Trades work pays better than service work, but also has a steeper learning curve, and also credentialization/certification is required, which can be expensive and time-consuming. 

I think what has happened is, increasingly competitive economic conditions and winner-take-all markets  has created an environment in which individual talent is more important than ever, so employees with highly sought after skills are paid more than ever, as the stakes are higher. There is an arms race between the major tech companies ,  Google, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon over 2-4 billion potential consumers. Bigger   companies means bigger cases, hence higher salaries for lawyers too, and also higher salaries for accountants and consultants. A wealthier population overall means more demand for healthcare and top doctors to treat rare diseases and conditions once thought to be incurable or untreatable, hence higher doctor and specialist salaries.",2021-09-24 08:47:26
VelveteenAmbush,"&gt; Last time I checked (admittedly ~15 years ago), there was zero pharma R&amp;D in Canada. And that's not a coincidence.

It would be very strange to say the least if the chief impediment to founding a successful pharma R&amp;D company in Canada were having *too many* white collar workers around who were willing to work for *too little* money... is this your theory? It brings to mind Yogi Berra's famous restaurant critique -- ""nobody goes there anymore because it's too crowded.""

&gt; So it's not due to naturally occurring supply &amp; demand curves.

Doesn't an outward shift of supply curves result in more, not less, aggregate wealth? In an opportunity cost sense, isn't failing to undertake a simple and free intervention to shift out the supply curve of a valuable input equivalent to artificially constricting the supply of the input?

&gt; These are Canada's most valuable companies:

KaiSosceles,"No one is waiting for Eth2.0. Ethereum users just value different things than competing L1 smart contract chains like Harmony. In the US, the SEC has officially fired the warning shot and projects like Harmony may be rendered illegal, whereas projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum have already been cleared as decentralized enough to not be securities.

Then you have network failures like Solana and we see that decentralization has merit, not just in censorability, but in uptime. It’s a running joke that traditional finance markets are only available 20% of the week, whereas crypto markets are 24/7/365…except if they’re down. ^.^

No Ethereum users are waiting for Eth2.0. Maybe people who don’t know what Eth2.0 actually is, or people who just sit around and hold bags of coins without actually using them, but people using Ethereum are using Ethereum. Using uniswap, sushiswap, lido staking, aave, curve, and the thousands of mainnet dapps out there to secure long term yields rather than chase down every new “Eth-killer” that has yet to ever actually kill Eth.

For mainnnet users, this means putting a lot of money on the table. People using mainnet with less 10k are basically just lighting money on fire. People who still want to use Eth for smaller fees have options through L2’s like Optimism, Arbitrum, DyDx, and about a dozen others.

Snoo72742,"Hello

My name is Thomas, I'm a 17 year old freshman in college, but currently I don't pursue any tech related degree. I'm majoring in finance. However, months ago I started watching coding tutorials and learning the basics of web development (html, css, javascript) in scrimba. I did my research and found that ruby on rails is quite popular in the startup world and begin doing Michael Hartl's ruby tutorial. 

I looked at your resume and github and your experience looks impressive. I feel I'm not advacing in my learning curve and haven't done any projects. I would like to become a RoR full stack developer, front end with react to be able to code web apps to solve people's problems and I think I would be a good mentee, I can commit to learn every week. Because of my college email address I have resources like orreily, frontend masters for free but I'm overwhelmed with what I need to learn

MoriSummers,"From your response, I don't think you truly understand how IPFS works. IPFS is a way to store your files in a decentralized way. You don't need to rely on any specific host, instead financially incentivizing nodes (in a similar way to blockchain) to store your data for you. You don't need to specify a host. In the crypto world, this solution is already used to create frontends that can't be tampered with and will live on for eternity. (Curve Finance, Tornado Cash, 1inch, AAVE, etc..)

You can think of this as similar to how bittorrent works. As long as there are enough peers, you can be quite sure that your file will be available and not tampered with using modern cryptography techniques. The problem is incentivizing peers to actually host your data, which is something that protocols that build on IPFS try to solve.",2021-09-27 05:29:12

jumnhy,"Excellent post from u/benido2030 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pwz2p9/daily_general_discussion_september_28_2021/helji9q) passing along some potential alpha from Darren Lau on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Darrenlautf/status/1442836788939083777).

Basically, Darren has listed projects that don't have a token yet but have some degree of clout in DeFi. I went through each of the projects listed, found a frontpage and did the barest of summaries. From my minimal reading on each protocol, I simply looked at what it was and if his claim regarding it being without a token so far/possible for an airdrop was worth looking into.


If you're interested in getting the next big dYdX airdrop, these are some options. No guarantees, but hey, I'll at least save y'all the trouble of clicking through these folks Twitter profiles.

See below.

Here's the list of airdrop-hunter target projects thrown out by Darren Lau in this thread 
(https://twitter.com/Darrenlautf/status/1442836788939083777?) along with links and a very brief take from doing the rounds myself. 


Paraswap (paraswap.io)
Aggregator a la 1inch. Not sure what their competitive edge is, haven't looked much to find out.


Defi Utilities/Portfolio Tracking

Defi Saver (defisaver.com)
OG CDP automation provider, now does so much more. u/nikolaj is always happy to help out with any questions. Staunchly mum as to any token launch plans, however...

DeBankDeFi (Debank.com)
Come along way in portfolio tracking since I last checked them out--serious competitor to/maybe even edging out Zerion, which had been my go-to for the last ... however long. In-house exchange should be tried out.


Zapper
OG portfolio tracker, lots of integrations for ""zapping"" into and out of various defi protocols. Has an in-house exchange you should use if seeking an airdrop.

Zerion.io
My go-to portfolio tracker, did an NFT drop a while back; has mobile support which I appreciate.

MetaMask
Just use the in-wallet swap function, guys. Everyone has had a Metamask wallet at some point, use it.


Stable swaps:

Saddle Finance (saddle.finance)
VC-backed Curve Finance clone (ported from Solidity to Vyper, I believe?). VC money = greater desire to cash out = greater chance of token creation.

Shell Protocol (shellprotocol.io | shells.exchange )
Similar to Curve, constant-sum market maker calling LP tokens ""shells"". Nifty idea, not sure what the differentiators are.


Yield Aggregators:

Gro Protocol (gro.xyz)
Tranched yields--""protected"" deposits. Liquidity bootstrapping pool going live on Balancer ASAP. 45% GRO allocated towards mining and future airdrops.

Unagii (Unagii.com)
Vaults a la (largely cloned from?) Yearn. 


Savings:

Orion (orion.money)
Kinda pyramid-schemey front-end to leverage a Terra-based stablecoin backed by future Terra transaction fees? Idk, but they do plan a token launch for ... very soon, theoretically.


**Yield Futures/Interest Rate Markets:**

Element Fi (element.fi)
derivatives of locked capital positions allowing leveraged yield and/or fixed rate savings

Horizon Fi (beta.horizon.finance)
Same deal as Element, different mechanism. Whitepaper is very... legal-esey.

Liquidity Underwriting:
KuuFinance (kuu.finance)
AVAX-based. Backstop protocol for liquidity/liquidations.

Goldfinch Fi (goldfinch.finance)
Uncollateralized loans--blend of trad/decentralized finance aimed at emerging markets

Fuji DAO (fujidao.org)
Borrowing/Lending Aggregator a la Defisaver, but not nearly so mature. 

Ribbon Finance (ribbon.finance)
""Structured products"" ie automated options and futures strategies? Not a finance guy, myself.

Hop Protocol (hop.exchange)
Interrollup/L2/Sidechain Bridge (ETH--Polygon--Optimism--Arbitrum--xDai)

EthBlock.Art

bluewalletsings,"Yes, especially taxes. I don't mind memorising formulas like Taylors Rule or something. 

Like in the other comments, CFAI has a habit of doing this. They don't derive stuff and just blurt out a formula. They really should make good use of the optional section and at least SHOW how certain conclusions are made; i.e. convexity effect on long term bonds, barbell vs bullet in yield curve changes. I don't have a higher education in finance, but I guess that if you show some derivations and mathematical proof, the whole thing would make a lot more sense and concrete rather than looking like some crazy magic.

Not to mention, their textbook is written like cypher text, I gave up reading their stuff. My strategy is to read as little of the text as possible and use MM notes whenever I have to. My opinion is MM's notes is clearly written based on the text. He dealt with all the nonsensical manure so that I don't have to.

Well. Back to something more relevant to you OP. I just sat for the exam in Aug. The first question was taxes. I can't remember what the question is and it is a question that you can only solve with their formula. I left that session blank because I hate memorising formulas. It was 3-5 points.

You don't have to worry yourself with the insane formula. My local Kaplan instructor has this saying ""CFAI doesn't test you on anything with more than 2 variables, it's mostly involves only sums and multiples. Never mind the crazy formulas""

I find that to be quite true. Especially with the private wealth section. For examples, The inheritance tax formula, don't worry about it.",2021-09-29 10:22:39
littlemssunshinepdx,"Non-profits are more likely to take a chance on you, because they’re more lean organizations, but the person in the level you’d be qualified for would require a lot of tactical knowledge in HR processes (e.g., benefits admin, onboarding, HRIS management, leave admin, workers comp, etc), and not having that experience might be a hindrance to getting a position as well as a learning curve for you. Another option is to look into an administrative position in a non-profit or smaller business, and then crawl up the butt of whoever IS HR and offer your help. Trust me, they’ll take it. 

I have an ops coordinator that does not report to me, but she’s always asking how she can help, and I say “well, if your supervisor believes you have the capacity, it would be helpful if…” and give her tasks. She now helps with our employee orientation process, does filing, collects policy acknowledgments, etc. Small, non-confidential stuff, some reporting, but now she can put on her resume that she assists in the employee onboarding and training process, that she has assisted in coordinating hiring events, etc. If she didn’t report into Finance I’d consider having her do more stuff, but I don’t like crossing the finance/HR divide — too much access to too much sensitive information. 

Anyway — that’s my best advice. Look for the side door using the experience you do have, and then get experience the experience you need to move into the role you want. 

Best of luck!",2021-09-29 12:27:22
Junior_Lead232,"I’ve recently been offered a senior consulting role at a big 4 in finance strategy and performance. Salary is low $100k aud (excluding super) I am coming from corporate banking (have been looking to get out of the industry for awhile) what is the largest learning curve for someone new to consulting? I am located in Western Australia is the salary offered considered market salary? My largest concern was the working hours known in management consulting however the partner that offered me the position (after single interview and sit down coffee catch up no case study or further interviews) reassured me that the hours aren’t 12-13hr days and if they were he would not offer me the role as it would be a poor result for the firm and for me, can anyone firm hours at big 4 (kpmg, PwC, Deloitte, EY)",2021-09-29 13:46:35

no-favors,"This is pretty much the state of finance these days. The level of knowledge our TSgt’s have is on the same level as our SSgt’s of yesteryear had and it goes down from there. I’ve got MSgt’s that are technicians instead of leading their flights. We’ve tried to automate a lot of functions and processes and while automation has helped curve the impact of manpower cuts we’ve incurred over the last 20 years, it’s also removed that institutional knowledge we once had and more importantly it’s made us lazy with understanding policies and regulations and it’s affect on the pay and accounting systems.",2021-09-29 18:57:55
