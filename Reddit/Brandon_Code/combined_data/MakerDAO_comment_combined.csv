biba8163,"Yes, you are probably right that there is greater usage of ETH and a lot more people in the crypto space than in 2017 going by gas prices and total addresses, etc.  Also GrayScale ETHE has quite a bit locked up, as has MakerDAO contracts and other such projects.  But overall, I think there is a much bigger supply in circulation than in 2017 going by the millions more in circulation since 2017 and countless ICOs who dumped millions on the market.  I think a lot of people have been misleading and cheerleading Ethereum investors with the idea that Ethereum suddenly has become more scarce than 2017 when it has not.  I see a lot people with influence in the Ethereum space like Ryan Sean Adams misleading investors with Ethereum scarcity narrative and even the EIP-1559 narrative that ETH is going deflationary which clearly isn't happening anytime soon.  Anyway, good luck with your investment.",2021-01-01 01:54:40
jolly_octopus,"The definition of security broader than the examples you listed; I've listed the SEC definition below. I'll also give some examples of cryptocurrency that I think are securities under the SEC definition:

-Binance coin is pretty obviously a security which represents a stake in the profitability of Binance. Because of the quarterly burn, there is an explicit ""profit-sharing agreement"" (see definition below). It was also distributed via an ICO. This is is definitely 1000% a security even by the most conservative definition of security.

-MakerDAO token is probably a security for the same reasons listed above. Plus, it enables governance voting, which could be seen as investing in a ""voting trust certificate"" (see below).

-Stablecoins in general might be considered ""evidence of indebtedness"" (see below) which could lead to arguing that they are securities. But I think DAI is a special case due to 1) the Dai Savings Rate implying a return on your investment, and 2) it's collateralized by ETH and MKR, making it a collateral trust certificate (see below).

__________________


""(1)  The term ""security"" means any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a ""security"", or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing.""",2021-01-01 05:26:31
Think-notlikedasheep,"&gt;Binance coin is pretty obviously a security which represents a stake in the profitability of Binance.

It is not an equity, so how does it represent a stake in the profitability of binance?   If Binance disappeared tomorrow, the coin would still have value (albeit lower)  but only because of the lack of liquidity since binance is the largest exchange it is traded on.      This is like saying dollar bills are a security because of the Federal Reserve's profitability.

&gt;MakerDAO token is probably a security for the same reasons listed above

How? Does Binance's profitability depend on it?  I doubt it.  

Using your example of ""quarterly burn reprsenting a profit sharing agreement"" bitcoin counts as a security because people keep having their bitcoin locked up or losing their keys.   In fact, fiat currency would be a security since people lose their fiat.  For example $60 million of pennies are thrown in the garbage every year.  

So the definition is FAR TOO BROAD.  

You can argue using that definition that baseball cards are securities, since there is a burn (people lose their cards, or their parents throw them away, or they put cards in the spokes of their bikes, effectively destroying them.

&gt;Stablecoins in general might be considered ""evidence of indebtedness"" 

Indebtednes of WHOM?     Someone borrowing money from someone using an IOU, that's a security?  Really?   Evidence of indebtedness deals with bonds and warrants.  Why isn't the SEC cracking down on payday loans, pawn shops, banks and people who lend money to other people on an informal basis?

So what you're doing is trying VERY HARD to extend the definition of security to things that are not securities.

So using your interpretation, a gift certificate or gift card is ""evidence of indebtedness"" and thus is a security.  Why isn't the SEC cracking down on all the companies issuing gift cards and gift certificates?   They're ""unregistered securities"" and illegal.",2021-01-01 06:06:36
gremlin0x,"So the current large debt system is MakerDAO. It allows minting Dai backed by a variety of tokenized assets.

On your stable eth thing, the guy talking about lambos isn't wrong. For good or bad, to bootstrap any new technology, you need to incentivize early investors and adopters to find future research and grow the network. Imagine a company whose stock was pegged to $1 through whatever mechanism you want, but gave yearly dividends based on revenue. That company would end up being quite boring since it would basically be no different than some kind of bond with variable interest rate. I'm not saying it's a terrible idea, but if the goal is to monetize the network effects of new technologies, you don't want the base equity to just be pegged to a dollar.",2021-01-01 07:02:27
freehk_fktheccp,"This is not exclusive to Ethereum by any means but as a result of network effect most of what's interesting in programmable blockchains is happening on Ethereum.

Right now there's a clear separation of truly private money (cash), spending money (debit/cc), investment (brokerage). Programmable blockchains provide a platform where all of this can exist under one umbrella.

If I want to take out a loan against my assets, there are quite a few options but one of which is MakerDAO. Better accessibility also makes it so that rates are competitive, currently, a loan against ETH is 2% but variable.

In real life application supposing I did this via brokerage there's significant lag time to actually move that money from my brokerage to my ""spending"" accounts. Or from cash into my brokerage accounts. On Ethereum this is instant.

Accessibility to p2p lending in real life isn't that great but on Ethereum I have easy access choices such as Aave, Compound where I can lend my USDC for pretty good rates, ~8% currently, with the obvious risk being maybe the contract is hacked and everything blows up. As a result of this risk we're now seeing both centralized and decentralized insurance options regarding smart contracts such as Opyn. Being able to buy insurance for the ""what if"" scenario eats into your yield but it's a nice option.

If I care about privacy and want the same kind of privacy that cash provides in real life it's very difficult to achieve this in real life. In Ethereum there are projects such as zkDAI and tornado.cash which provide ease of accessibility to privacy.

Programmable money lowers the barrier to entry of competition and definitely will continue to force laws to play catch up as innovation continues to progress very quickly.",2021-01-01 08:25:34

nootropicat,"I think they are in a very bad spot now, as there's no reason to use dai over usdc. Especially borrowing dai is extremely risky, I barely escaped liquidation when it mooned on coinbase to 1.3usdc.  
For some weird reason eth collateral rate is 150% when every defi platform is at 120%-125%. Bad deal from every possible angle. They have some adoption inertia but usdc is taking a bigger and bigger share of the pie. A large part of DAI's demand is 'fake' in the sense that's it's only used to farm (especially CRV).  
Even on eth pairs it was flipped by usdt.  

https://info.uniswap.org/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2

In general they were proven incompetent, as their governance structure forces small incremental changes when drastic moves were required. Rather than having a USDC vault at 101% collateral ratio the proper move was to directly sell new DAI for usdc until it's at $1. Makerdao would have a warchest that could then be used to stabilize the price, possibly earning interest on unspent reserves and using that to burn MKR. In the kyc event it would be easy to get rid of USDC even by selling it for eth as a last measure. It's going to be way harder to get rid of the USDC vault without driving DAI wildly off the peg again.",2021-01-01 20:14:22
in_a_land_far_away,"Sure well it depends really who you trust your money with. USDC is backed up by identical dollar amounts locked up in trusted 3rd party accounts and is considered very risk free. However, if the price of the dollar does really collapse in the distant future I would be sceptical if it survives.

At the end no one can complain about being liquidated. It's getting your remaining ether sold for zero that is the problem. 

When black Thursday happened it was estimated people lost 8.25M. Today that ether is worth 75M. Do you think people are just going to sit and let that be?

You bet there will be a waterfall of lawsuits coming towards the Maker Foundation. With these prices a lot of people will find it profitable to go through the trouble and spend in lawyers and arbitration costs.

mexfogel,"There is already an ongoing court case here in San Francisco. It was a class action law suit but it was moved into arbitration. That's a win for the maker foundation because instead of being liable for all 1,000 or more victims at the same time now each person has to bring their own case independently to arbitrate. Not everyone can afford to do so but with current ether prices a lot of people will feel compelled to do so.

It will be up to the judge in the arbitration case to decide if the maker foundation is responsible for any losses. 

They will have to look into the terms of use and see if makerDAO made it super explicitly clear that using the maker dao contact meant a potential loss of 100% of your assets.

Also, they'll look into how the contract was not supposed to allow zero bids. Not only did user lost their collateral completely but also MakerDAO lost 4 million of dollars due to the same auction bid flaw. 

One thing is to use a contract that is risky that can lead to losses and another one is that the contract was flawed and caused losses. 

How come the makerdao printed and sold MKR to repay their own losses yet left its users hanging in the air at a loss for the exact same flaw? The Foundation will say decisions are made by the makerdao decentralized governance but since the flawed contract was written by them It will be up the judge to decide if they are ultimately liable or not.

Regarding the US global jurisdiction i believe it's pretty global and it has a span to all major first world countries. If the arbitration rules against them they will have to pay.

jonaslamis,"The term Freezing Assets is a specific example of ""being able to update the contracts"".  The StakerDAO Governing Council (Olaf, Luke Y, Shaishav, Spencer Noon, and myself) can vote to ""update the contracts"" to any specification that is proposed through governance.  This includes things like: 
- pausing the contracts because there is some sort of bug or hack
- implementing a tax on the vault (currently set at 0%).  Think of this as MakerDAO adjusting their interest rate.
- doing something more substantial like moving all vaults to a FA 2.0 token or changing how the overall system functions based on tickets, privacy, or some other layer 1 upgrade.

An anti-goal is to ""freeze assets"".  But it is necessary to balance security and upgradability against contract control.  We're trying to navigate that at StakerDAO with first the council model, and then evolving to the community controlled model.

For those who have been paying attention to Ethereum based defi, this is the same kind of architecture that Compound and Uniswap have implemented.  Tightly controlled contracts at launch that moved to more decentralized control with the issuance of their governance tokens.",2021-01-05 08:53:17

yahehe,"My interpretation of ""Unrelated Debt-Financed Income"" is there's an implied third party supplying debt to the IRA, basically accessible funds not funded by contributions or gains. So if I wanted to buy a rental property with my LLC and took out a mortgage, or took out a loan to buy even more Eth, those funds would not be tax advantaged.  


With MakerDAO there's not really a third party, you're loaning assets to yourself via a protocol. DAI isn't borrowed from other users, it's created when you open a vault, and it's burned when you repay. You can't withdraw your Eth while it's in the vault without paying back the loan, so in a way you're temporarily *reducing* the value of your IRA. I'm not sure if it would fit the definition of ""acquisition indebtedness"", but I would be very interested to know what an expert has to say. I wonder what this would mean for other DeFi dapps like Compound as well. Definitely a complex space to navigate, I've been thinking about finding a CPA/tax attorney as I'm in a similar boat.  


As an aside, I've started planning for a first house and contemplating taking a $20k loan (me + wife) from my SDIRA, and I realized I could probably do that without losing any gains by opening a CDP.

&gt;Looks like a solid project and it seems that the team has been able to assemble some of the big hitters in the defi space, which is promising for stETH (Lido's eth2.0 derivative) integration in the various defi protocols. I am not so happy about the economics and distribution of the corresponding LDO governance token, as only 36% are allocated to the DAO-controlled treasury. That being said, there is no need to hold the LDO token in order to stake.

&gt;Just a heads-up, there is chatter about a Badger-style targeted airdrop for early adopters. Still early days but might be worth interacting with the protocol in case there is a successful governance vote.

The airdrop is currently being voted on 

https://mainnet.lido.fi/#/lido-dao/0x2e59a20f205bb85a89c53f1936454680651e618e/vote/20/

And you can check if your address is eligible here 

https://github.com/vshvsh/ldo-airdrop/blob/master/snapshot/lido-07a-human-readable-balances.json 

It looks like this first airdrop really only rewards stakers who have taken on additional risk by depositing ETH early on. The cutoff block was around 10 days after genesis. There are however ideas discussed in the governance forum to have a second airdrop with a future cutoff block.

i-love-the-pink-one,"Still learned here, but what is the reason auctions take so long? Surely it would be better to speed up the process to ensure that liquidations occur and are processed in full? That way, keepers can immediately return to the debt auctions and keep the process going in the event of a sharp drop in collateral value.  

For example, if ETH value drops 30-40%, I'd have to imagine there would be a significant number of liquidations to process. If it dropped another 30-40% over a couple of days (please no), shouldn't we be ensuring all the vaults that need to be liquidated are so to maintain the health and confidence of the MakerDao system and the value of Dai?",2021-01-06 19:14:19

keynya,"Here comes a little rant:

Not everything has to be a moonshot in my life (shocking, right). So I was looking at the possibilities using a ""stable"" coin in kind of crypto savings account which returns a few percent interest each year. I love DAI. Unfortunately it is pegged to the devaluing USD. The USD lost over 10% against my native currency (Swiss franc) over the last year. Lending it out on Aave or Compound would make me loose money over time. Even with the more risky yearn DAI vault I would just barely break even. A part of this 10% devaluation against the Swiss franc is due to the Swiss franc increasing in value, but the USD also lost against other major currencies like GBP, JPY etc. So, even for these currencies lending out a USD pegged stable coin on Aave or Compound is not a viable strategy.

Why don't we have proper stable coins in crypto? Something which is stable against inflation and whose price is not controlled by nations and their endless money printing. As far as I remember, MakerDAO initially wanted to build something like that, but they went with a USD pegged stable coin.

Long story short I do not like losing money slowly, so I went for the moonshot again by providing WBTC-ETH liquidity.

Looking forward to the time I can have a savings account using stable coins which actually deserve their name and I can finally get rid of my old school fiat bank account.

You serious here? Algoritm is mathematical based. Dai is based on collateralization. It gets it's feed from 14 exchanges, that's how it determines the price of eth. 

 Dai has been here for years FYI. You actually CAN manipulate it if you can manipulate the price of eth, you can then force a collateralization of eth, but that's not an easy feat on itself and the more it gets adopted/used, the less likely that will happen too. 


""What if the algo fucks up"" sounds extremely ignorant by the way. Since it's based on mathematics/code and it's contract is open source afaik. You can audit it yourself if you want and see if you can find a hole. In fact, holes has been found in several smart contracts, including makerdao, and it has been patched up. The contract is open source too, so if you really don't trust it you can audit it yourself. 

Imo what is truly dangerous is trusting a third party with your money. USDT, usdc, all custodian stable coins should be avoided. Only stable coins like dai, based on code should be used/trusted as that is part of the decentralized finance revolution.",2021-01-08 21:04:08

jsibelius,"Yes, one benefit of having custody over your funds is that you can actually *use them* in DeFi and to interact with the whole Ethereum ecosystem as a whole. In fact, once you try it, you will find that it provides incredibly powerful financial instruments. Throw them in MakerDao and you can get a decentralised, permissionless loan. (It seems in the future banks will accept stablecoins like Dai so it might be possible to them buy something directly with it instead of exchanging the dai for USD) I strongly encourage you to check out the whole DeFi space :) You can get mad returns on your ETH.

Another benefit is that you don't have a ""counterparty risk"". This means that Coinbase (or another custodian of funds) being hacked or going down for some reason doesn't mean that you will lose your crypto. However, with more power comes more responsibility - you are now responsible for securing your crypto - you need to own a hardware wallet if you own a large amount to protect yourself from hackers. You need to manage your seed words (the words from which your private key is derived)  so you don't lose the funds.",2021-01-09 16:23:15

Beef_Lamborghinion,"You forgot t mention the loss of investors confidence in MakerDAO during the march debacle, in part due to a confusing liquidation process. At that time, people where even wondering if Maker would make it through.

You mention however DAI loss of peg, but you present it as if it was a good thing (excess demand) whereas we were all worried about the health of our investment when DAI could not go back to peg after months.

Finally, whales were perhaps worried when they realized that the original, decentralized DAI could never scale. Instead, Maker had to compromise and include custodial assets, which, for some people, was the end of this fantastic experiment because DAI would become partially centralized and censorable.

So overall, while DAI is still thriving, there are some concerns on the long term success of the initiative. Personally, I loved the old DAI (SAI), I am ok to use the new DAI, but I put it on par with USDC now, even lower than USDC, since USDC has more regulatory clarity.",2021-01-10 04:26:14

JustCryptoFun,"Not entirely true:  


""MakerDAO launched with 1,000,000 MKR tokens at its inception. The tokens are created and destroyed under different circumstances. MKR is destroyed when the Maker Protocol’s system surplus exceeds a minimum threshold, resulting in excess Dai being auctioned for MKR that is then destroyed. Inversely, when the Maker Protocol is running a deficit and the system debt exceeds a maximum threshold, **MKR is created** and auctioned for Dai in order to recapitalize the system.""

ethereumflow,Do you know what MakerDAO is?,2021-01-10 13:22:06
Treyzania,"&gt;the same way a program is coded into IOS apps

This is pretty misleading.  The kinds of things you want to build using a smart contract is very specific and you want to go out of your way to minimize the amount of actual code running on the chain.  Smart contracts are relatively useless and you want to shift as much of the logic as possible to the client side, treating contracts on chain as at most basic of a primitive as possible.

In the MakerDAO case, that primitive is fairly sophisticated so there does naturally end up being a lot more logic executing on chain to make it work.

To OP:

Think of contracts executing on chain as programs executing in a trusted fully transparent computer that anyone can pay a small fee to interact with.  You can only interact with contracts through specific interfaces, so you can treat these interfaces and the logic of the contract as trusted and can build more sophisticated systems using these primitives.  Systems like MakerDAO being one example.",2021-01-10 13:28:21

Why no one calls these people on their shit is beyond me, especially when some of them market themselves as ""former MakerDAO.""",2021-01-10 14:01:14

Instead, Maker had to compromise and include custodial assets, which, for some people, was the end of this fantastic experiment because DAI would become partially centralized and censorable.

You should do a better job researching because it's been on the roadmap since day one to include other (also centralised) stablecoins and eventually off-chain assets, which will always require an enforceable legal framework.

I understand a lot of people want a *100%* decentralised, permissionless stablecoin system, who doesn't, but MakerDAO's longterm goals to include off-chain assets eventually makes that impossible.

MakerDAO didn't compromise on their system design, a lot of people just started with the wrong expectation of the system to begin with.",2021-01-10 20:27:46

re76,"Basically the people who do their own research and can understand the implications of a technology like Ethereum have information that the rest of the population might not have.

For example when I read about MakerDAO in 2018 I was beyond excited about the implications. At that point I could understand the implications and make some educated guesses about how it would create immense value. This was information I had that others did not. That’s all I mean when I say information asymmetry.

It’s especially pronounced in the Ethereum because of the inherently technical nature of Ethereum.

This time, with a MakerDao CDP I opened last night for my stack, even though it is underwater by several thousand dollars, and even though it is collateralized at 225%, and even though I made this trade just after the monthly high (on its first bounce), I'm not selling.

itovault,"Sometimes an asset could be grandfathered in.  The MakerDAO was afraid the DAI was going to be a security for a long time, but then it turned out to be okay.  Are you mostly afraid the government taking the token from you?  Is that the main blocker for you (e.g. if they solved regulation, you'd buy it immediately).",2021-01-12 14:06:03
BUIDL000,"On open market (exchanges), the peg is maintained by trading bots and traders that believe it should be on peg. Behind open market, within the MakerDAO system, the value of minted DAI tokens are maintained by the automated liquidation system that holds auction allowing bidders to obtain ETH below market value, using DAI, effectively recycling circulating DAI and burn them away, making unbacked debt disappear as the collaterals are released. This internal mechanism gives market participant confidence about the DAI's truly backed, hence they will go out to maintain the peg should there be any deviation. 

When there's not enough market participant actively controlling the peg, the natural supply and demand will overwrite the strength of peg-maintaining traders. 

Example scenario 1: there's an expansion in DEFI requiring larger amount of DAI than the existing circulating DAIs, the unavailability (shortage) of DAI will cause people to name a higher price on DAI to just get them in hands, creating competition with other DAI buyers. 

Example scenario 2: Forget about DAIs, let's say CAD attempt to run fixed exchange rate with USD but offer a much higher saving rate or offer much greater CAD denominated investment opportunity while both countries have similar import/export with each other without trade imbalance. In this case, it will cost Canada central bank a lot of money to maintain the fixed exchange rate unless they stop/limit the inflow of USD into their country. 

Likewise, if Maker governance made the wrong combination of policies, DAI will go off peg too, and it will cost MKR holders money, with the mechanism of printing more MKR or lower reduced MKR token price, or stagnant MKR token price in crypto overall bull market. It's in MKR holder's best interest to come up with policies to maintain the peg so their MKR holdings will worth something. 

If you simply pull a fork without publicly telling people why you should be supported (think Roger Ver and Craig Wright), you won't get people to open up vaults to deposit collateral then print, and you won't get bidders to grab collaterals during liquidation auctions so your plan won't work out.  If the fork you created don't have any traction on the price of your forked MKR and there's not a group of governance people holding your forked MKR with interest in maintaining the peg of forked DAI, it will also collapse rather quickly.",2021-01-12 15:46:46

&gt;DeFi Saver is an advanced management app for decentralized finance protocols and we have built-in service fees for our advanced features. We will list all existing fees per each of our dashboards below.

&gt;**MakerDAO, Compound and Aave dashboards
Standard interactions** (e.g. Add/Withdraw collateral; Borrow/Pay back debt)
have **no service fees.**



&gt;**Advanced interactions** (Boost, Repay, Create leveraged position, Close leveraged position) have a **0.25% service fee** (of the transaction size).


&gt;**Automation adjustments have a 0.3% service fee** (of the transaction size, per automated adjustment).
(Simply having your position Automed and monitored by the Automation system does not include any sort of fee over time.)


&gt;**Loan Shifter**

&gt;Depending on the complexity of the shift you are making, any **existing fees will differ**.

&gt;**Protocol shifts have no service fees**, but do **include a 0.09% Aave flash loan fee**.
&gt;**Collateral and Debt shifts include a 0.25% service fee, as well as a 0.09% Aave flash loan fee.**


&gt;**Exchange**
All token swaps in the separate Exchange **have a 0.125% service fee** (of the transaction size).
Smart Savings dashboard
All options in the Smart Savings dashboard are without any sort of service fee.
The fees collected help us continue and accelerate further DeFi Saver development.

&gt;We will always publicly disclose any changes to existing fees in DeFi Saver in a timely manner.",2021-01-15 01:18:47

AlethiaArete,"People already get liquidated when theres a
crash. As much as its thier fault for not understanding the risks, you dont want liquidations especially since a lot of crypto people dont get finance at all. Having both sides of the equation volatile increases overall risk by 2x at first look.

The worst case is the asset (silver, for instance) skyrockets up 50% as in my example above and the collateral (WBTC, ETH) crashes some 50% (or more) as is known to happen and suddenly you have a 100% swing and everyone with less than 200% collateralization is liquidated.

The way it is with USD is that since USD is whats being measured, only one pole of the equation can swing meaning while you CAN get massive falls in ETH or whatever of 50%+ your not going to get in a situation where your adding another 50%+ to the swing and thus 150% is relatively safe (200%+ is better) and people still get liquidated during the big drops because they go full on risk and leverage to the hilt without realizing risk is risk.

MakerDAO is meant to be stable. That's why they added a ton of collateral types and even stablecoins. There are other platforms that allow for assets like your talking about, MakerDAO doesnt need to do that too.

And honestly in most cases debt is not good. When you use a system like MakerDAO, Nexo, Compound, etc for a loan your locking up between 150%-200% of value that could be earning interest and your paying interest on top of it for 100% of value and then theres gas fees also. Your earning less money taking a loan unless you transfer what you borrowed into an asset and capture a moonshot. I'd rather just buy outright under those terms.

Finally, PAXG looks pretty trustworthy for a crypto. If you want a decentralized version of a metal, than buy it physically and keep it in your house.",2021-01-15 03:01:11

maqstica,"I would prefer to wait until we have a clear date in sight to for the ETH bridge to be completed. But, we are making good progress. Building the ETH-ZIL bridge requires us complete the following sub-projects:  
1. Adding new language constructs to the smart contract language =&gt; This is done.  
2. Writing the cros-chain contracts =&gt; This is done and has been tested as well.  
3. Adding a few new things in the blocks to allow light clients to check transaction data =&gt; This is more or less done but needs testing and integration at the protocol-layer.  
3. Writing a relayer that will pass information from ZIL chain to ETH chain =&gt; This is work in progress but needs 3 to be fully ready  
4. End to end testing  


Once we have all this done, we will have to build some front-end interface for end users.   


The bridge will bring more assets on the ZIL chain such as ETH and other ERC20 tokens. This bridge is somewhat generic, so it can also connect to BTC allowing people to wrap their BTC and bring it on the ZIL chain. Once these assets are on the ZIL chain, they can be used in LP pools on ZILSwap -- a Uniswap-like DEX or can be used as collaterals in Pillar which is similar to MakerDAO. More assets would mean more on-chain transaction volume which would mean more gas paid to the network.

CryptoTAFA," this was from the ZIL AMA today, I ask them about what they will do for 2021 and here is the answer.

In 2021, we will focus on the following key areas:

1. Dev Tooling and Usability: We developed quite a few toolkits for developers to use but I think we need to add a few more and improve upon what we already have.
2. Governance: So, far we the core development team has been on the driving seat but we plan to change it by providing the community the right tools to do so. Through our staking programme, we are distributing governance tokens aka gZIL to the stakers which can be used to vote on all aspects of the protocol. Just yesterday, we launched a governance portal for gZIL holders to vote on. More will come on this.
3. DeFi dapps: In 2020, with the help of our ecosystem partners, we saw a stablecoin being launched, a DEX, staking and several fungible tokens. More DeFi dapps such as MakerDAO like applications will be launched in 2021. We expect a lot more tokens as well.
4. ETH-ZIL Bridge: We are currently building a bridge between ZIL and ETH. This will bring assets like ETH and other ERC20s on top of Zilliqa including BUSD (Binance USD).
5. Core protocol optimizations: Last but not the least we will continue to improve the platform to increase the throughput and lower the latency.",2021-01-15 23:28:51
AusIV,"You wouldn't really use a smart contract that way.

What you might do is have the employer put the employee's wages into a timelocked escrow contract. If the employee completes their tasks, they can claim the money from the contract. If the employee doesn't show up for work, the employer can intervene and stop the payout.

In this example, it would be possible for the employer to cancel a payout despite the employee doing the work - with several caveats. Since it's happening on a public blockchain, future employees could see that this was a common practice of the employer. Additionally, the employee could see that the money for their wages exists and is allocated to them, so there's no risk that the employer actually doesn't have the money.

More practically though, smart contracts are used for more atomic transactions. With something like MakerDAO or compound, you can collateralize an asset of an established value and borrow another asset against your collateral. If you don't pay back your debt, your collateral gets taken, but nobody is even capable of taking your collateral while you are meeting the terms of the loan. You can also trade digital tokens through smart contracts; you make an offer that you'll pay X units of Token A for Y units of Token B, and someone else can complete that trade, but only under the specific terms spelled out by the contract. Tokens themselves are smart contracts, which have specific rules for token issuance, transfers, etc.

It doesn't totally do away with the need for contracts in the physical world where an employer commits to paying an employee for providing a service that cannot be measured by a smart contract, but it covers off a lot of neat use cases.",2021-01-16 00:30:11
Erasmus1254,"Who best to give that answer than Amrit Kumar, one of the Zilliqa Co-founders and current President on the core Zilliqa team. He wrote these two responses to questions regarding the ETH bridge in the r/cryptocurrency AMA today.

Question: What makes Zil’s ETH bridge stand out when compared to other project’s ETH bridges that are set to be rolling out in the near future as well ?

Amrit's response: ""I think the main difference would be what users could do once those tokens are moved from ETH to another network. There has to be a usage for those tokens beyond just trading. On the Zilliqa side, it could be used on ZILSwap to provide liquidity, in Pillar as a collateral or other yield generating products. In the end, the success of a bridge will depend a lot on how much the community is engaged in driving the liquidity.""

That means there is 100 DAI floating around that nobody needs to unlock their own collateral, which violates some of the assumptions that keep the system stable.

everynameitryistak3n,"This is what I was going to say (Celsius or Blockfi).  Loaning DAI on Compound has a variable rate, so it is not always 13%. And, depending on how much you are talking about here, the gas fees for making a vault, generating DAI, and putting it on Compound mean it could take you a couple months just to break-even.

Also, the apr you get for keeping ETH on Celsius is currently 5.5% (5.25% on Blockfi).  Let's say with the makerdao/compound route you maintain a safe 300% collateral.  So you earn 13% on the DAI you borrowed, which is 1/3 the value of your staked ETH.  In terms of the total value of your ETH tied up in it, you are earning 4.33%.

I say just putting the ETH on Celsius or Blockfi is cheaper to do, pays a better rate, and you can take your ETH back at any time.",2021-01-18 08:26:24

DeviateFish_,"&gt; I'm not sure what prompted you to reply this. I don't disagree with it at all. That's exactly what I meant with the race for position continuing as-is.

I was replying to the ""people don't know what they could pay to still get included"" bit :)  Some people are very aware that they could pay less and still get included, but inclusion isn't what's important to them.

&gt; Sure you can use the median gas price, but it would still be more than you would have needed to pay for inclusion. This is just basic tragedy of the commons.

I don't see how this is a tragedy of the commons situation though.

&gt; Given that it is trivial to prove, please share a link or elaborate on that proof. I fail to see how it doesn't conflict with your earlier statement that ""Basically, fees escalate more quickly under EIP-1559, and are incapable of staying at sustained high levels for as long as they can under the first-price auction, meaning demand spikes are dampened more harshly than they currently are.""

We've had multiple times over Ethereum's history where the transaction pool grows more than twice as fast as the quantity of transactions that get included on the blockchain.  Any time this is the case, even having 2x blocks won't keep up with that level of demand.

Unfortunately, it's not like anyone logs transaction pool statistics.  The closest thing I have for a source for that was when the mempool got flooded to help push the zero-bid liquidations in... MakerDAO, I think it was?

It doesn't conflict with my earlier statement because it's an example of it.  When there are huge spikes in demand like this, an inelastic block size means the spike is over when the backlog is transacted; under EIP-1559, transactions cannot get included until the `basefee` drops to an adequate level.  Given that this requires a reduction in demand (and mining multiple blocks of &lt; 1x throughput), I suspect this means that spikes are stretched over a long period, during which time *only* the highest-paying transactions can be included, even if there is available space.

&gt; How does it make it more expensive to end users? Worst case (spikes of &gt;2x demand), we reduce to the first-price auction system that we currently have.

The cost of inclusion goes up during periods of large demand, and require a ""cooling down"" period before a lower cost of inclusion is achieved.  In the first-price model, the spike is done when all of the high-paying transactions are included, which means the very next blocks can be full of lower-paying ones, without having to wait for `basefee` to decline far enough to include them.

In order to compensate for this, users will have to pay more, on average, to meet the bar for inclusion.

In light of the above, I'm not sure you can actually completely separate ""inclusion"" and ""position"", given that ""inclusion"" is just ""position"" with respect to blocks, rather than position within a block.",2021-01-18 13:56:26

with DID and SSI it might work but its still got the same problems with dividing tokens over x no of accounts. its just a bit harder, you could just farm out zombie accounts given people 50$ in stablecoins as a ""prize"" if they sign up for it and their identity can be used. this would be a malicious vector.",2021-01-18 14:45:00

There will always be a market for instant and feeless transactions.... I think that market can then be segmented into USD vs. non-USD. Nano is competing for the latter. As the US continues to print USD, the market for the latter continues to grow.

da-future-is-bright,"&gt;Can MakerDAO exist on a different blockchain?

Yes it can, but there are three obstacles:

1. Collateral/DeFi - other chains will need to have new, desirable collateral types for Maker to use, as well as a broader DeFi ecosystem

2. Community - many here think Ethereum is the ultimate chain, so there may be difficulty persuading some that bridging or a full migration is necessary",2021-01-18 19:07:24
richards_86,"In a period where there is more potential for upward price action, I'd be looking at leveraging the ETH I have to purchase more ETH. There are a variety of ways to do so, but the one I like is using MakerDao's vaults. Now, with that being said it does require a little more ETH than doing something on a more centralized platform as transaction fees can be a bit of a bite but in the grand scheme of things, it wouldn't matter if the leverage is deployed at the right time and managed effectively.

Essentially the process would be:

\- Open MakerDao ETH-A vault (or ETH-B if you don't mind a higher fee for slightly more leverage | you can also do wBTC and a bunch of other collaterals)

\- Lock your ETH in- Mint a DAI (a loan to yourself)

\- Swap DAI for ETH- Lock ETH into the vault

When it comes time to close your leveraged position, with enough price action up you'll be able to pay the stability fee and outstanding DAI balance with a fraction of the ETH you bought on borrowed money. What I like best about this approach is that you're dealing in DAI and your collateral of choice, no other side token hustle.",2021-01-19 03:47:14

pietjepuk_,"&gt; We've had multiple times over Ethereum's history where the transaction pool grows more than twice as fast as the quantity of transactions that get included on the blockchain. Any time this is the case, even having 2x blocks won't keep up with that level of demand.

&gt; Unfortunately, it's not like anyone logs transaction pool statistics. The closest thing I have for a source for that was when the mempool got flooded to help push the zero-bid liquidations in... MakerDAO, I think it was?

&gt; It doesn't conflict with my earlier statement because it's an example of it. When there are huge spikes in demand like this, an inelastic block size means the spike is over when the backlog is transacted; under EIP-1559, transactions cannot get included until the basefee drops to an adequate level. Given that this requires a reduction in demand (and mining multiple blocks of &lt; 1x throughput), I suspect this means that spikes are stretched over a long period, during which time only the highest-paying transactions can be included, even if there is available space.

I'm sorry. Is this the ""trivial proof"" you alluded to? It does not really look like a proof to me, let alone trivial to perform. You're saying that if would have history of the entire mempool (and magically somehow know how actors would increase/decrease their gas prices under different circumstances), we could prove that EIP-1559 does not help. Foregoing the proof, I would've expected you to at _least_ run some ""trivial"" simulations modelling the behavior you mention, and showing that EIP-1559 is worse (or not better) than first-price auctions.",2021-01-19 05:35:50

Revanchist1,"ATH today! I can feel it in my bones! 


All this consolidation near the ATH makes me feel more comfortable that we won't just dip when we hit ATH and might perform similar to BTC and blow past all time high with a minimal dip. 


ETH price is important in the long run. I made a post before where I said it's All or Nothing. If Ethereum accomplishes its goal/aim, it WILL have a market cap in the trillions. The price of ethereum is liquidity for the system - Economic bandwith. It allows more things to be done on the network. 

Ethereum is so young and all the applications that have been developed already is mind-blowing. A few years ago, I could not imagine half the thing we have today. What are we going to see 5+ years from now? I know new applications will be developed but I don't know what they will be. So far everything has been somewhat similar to what we have today with traditional finance. But we are already seeing applications stray from their traditional counterparts. And the fact that systems can be freely be built on top of one another is only going to accelerate these developments.

There will be pillars/supporting structures in Ethereum that will be worth holding. MakerDao and Uniswap come to mind. These two support structures have allowed so many new applications to be built. Synthetix and Aave also come to mind. They are pillars that will further be developed upon by other applications.

Keep an eye out for new applications that create new ""support structures"" that allow new functions that have never been done before. Makerdao with Dai - stablecoin, Aave with flash loans, Synthetix with Synthetic Assets, Uniswap and their AMM.

Currently a small blockchain called Near Protocol has been attracting Chainlink, 1inch, Balancer and MakerDao to build on them because they are a shared blockchain, can help them ease congestion and will help them prepare on how to build a compostable system on a shared blockchain similar to ETH 2.0.

FidelHimself,"Simply put, a DAO is a way to organize around a common purpose. The first DAO was MakerDAO and their purpose is to lend dollars, accepting Ethereum (a cryptocurrency) as collateral. 

A DAO makes up it's own governance model depending on the participants and the mission. [Curve.fi](https://Curve.fi) provides liquidity for large trades to make them less expensive. Token holders recieve the profits proportionate to their stake and vote on the general direction of the DAO.

We do this in a permission-less fashion, meaning any child with funds and proper knowledge can interact without a bank or license and begin earning money.  Individuals interact directly with the protocol so their is are no middlemen. There are software developers who code the new features of the DAO but nothing is commited to the blockchain without a vote from the DAO. Said programmers are paid by the DAO which is all visible on a public blockchain.

By comparison, we don't even apply blockchain to traditional government voting which is criminal imo.

Anyway, you apply a DAO to a traditional HOA and you have basically what I'm advocating for. HOAs usually cover basic maintenance and/or security for a community but I'm suggesting that they provide basically everything the traditional governments provide today. In this way we don't have to all live under each other's rules. My Capitalist community can be a quarter mile from a Communist community so long as both communities have voluntary participants. How much conflict would this solve today?

Socialists could form their own DAO with a token that re-bases or redistributes the entire token supply over night for example. Or a less extreme example could be Socialists only except CommieCoin and you can only get CommieCoin by surrendering privately owned means of production.

nikola_j,"Hey u/oakridgefarm and u/Mkkoll.

Automation for MakerDAO runs on Maker price oracles and your configurations. Regardless of current market prices, the boosts (and repays) will happen based on the price in the Maker protocol as that is what affects your ratio.

As of now, Boosts happen only based on the current price, not nextn one. So only once the next price becomes the current, live price.

That means that a boost will happen even if the market price potentially went lower than what the Maker oracle updated to.

Next price is only considered for Repays, where an Emergency Repay will be triggered when a next price gets scheduled that pushes your ratio less than 10% above the liquidation ratio for the used collateral.

FaceDeer,"If literally *none* of them switch over, then the new fork never gets going and the old fork remains as-is.

This is pretty unlikely, though. Even if miners organize and a large number decide to remain on the old fork, some number will switch to the EIP-1559 fork instead. This would result in a contentious fork, with both sides continuing to run in a similar manner to Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.

At that point the users will decide which chain they prefer. It's unlikely that the result will be ""both"", they'll pick one or the other en masse (since much of Ethereum's value these days comes from network effects - if only one chain has a functioning MakerDAO, for example, lots of other dapps will only function well on that chain).

This will result in one of the chains having tokens with value similar to Ether's current value and the other chain having tokens worth a lot less. The one with high-value tokens will be able to support a lot of miners, the one with low-value tokens will only be able to support a small number of miners. Market forces will drive the miners to the high-value chain - those who refuse to follow the market will hemorrhage money.

So if it's looking like there's going to be a contentious fork there may be a couple of days of rough markets while this all gets sorted out, but I expect in the end the user-preferred chain will continue as if there hadn't been a contentious fork in the first place and the user-dispreferred chain will remain as an irrelevant minor coin nobody in particular uses.

Given how popular EIP-1559 seems to be with users and developers, I expect that'll be the chain that survives. It may not pay miners as well as it did before EIP-1559, but it'll be preferable to not being paid at all and so miners will mine it.

greengenerosity,"Simplest explanation for why some legitimate crypto company complying with the laws and regulations would launch their own stablecoin is just the publicity and prestige since the coin in volume and marketcap becomes a proxy for the trust of the actual company, the USDC web page starts out with how it is a Circle / Coinbase partnership. I don't know of any other direct financial reasons why they would do it, I don't think they have any income from the interest of the cash reserves.  


The people behind DAI get prestige and influence and it is a proof of concept from the makerdao organization. It is the smallest of the big coins despite being the most crypto with supposed provable collateralization.  


I know Binance does not fit in your question, but it is easy to see that ""Binance USD"" is basically advertisement for their exchange and a partnership with a company called PAXOS (Which has their own stablecoin called ""Paxos Standard"") PAXOS advertises three way 1:1 conversion between BUSD/PAX/USD and advertises itself as a way to exit crypto through stablecoin-to-wire transfers.  


Stablecoins themselves let people who want to exit the price of ETH do it without having to go to a centralized exchange. The only way to stay in crypto while not risking a IOU on a exchange at a fixed price is to hold the private keys of a stable coin, stablecoin-collapse or frozen-address risk only. Stablecoins does not make it easier to enter crypto, but it is supposed to make it easier to exit with less KYC/AML by sending the stablecoins to some service that then does a wire transfer.  


The potential minuscule upside for non-criminals and crime victims of regulated stablecoins like USDC is that they can freeze coins that are stolen/scammed/involved in crime, Circle will freeze any address that law enforcement requests them to as a example.",2021-01-24 06:36:50
MrMoustacheMan,"So there will definitely be [CBDCs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc.asp) coming in the near term, but as the name implies they are not decentralized.

imo the issue with most crypto is that, even if they're satisfactorily decentralized, they are treated more like speculative assets, and the volatility may not make them attractive as a currency (though they are divisible). While BTC was supposed to realize the cypherpunk dream of ecash per the whitepaper, it's transaction fees and confirmation times make that untenable so it is now considered more attractive as a sore of value akin to e-gold.

Proponents of some projects like Nano I think are more optimistic that near instantaneous transactions and low fees make it more viable as a currency, but I'm not well versed enough to argue the point there.

honestly i wouldnt touchc this products with a 10 foot pole. just open up a brokerage account. but yes i see the point about trading commodities / stocks in a censorship resistant fashion. that said if stock xyz is banned on all real brokerage exchanges. how could blockchain possibly gain exposure to the stock? perhaps if the company issued their equity on blockchain. which then would remove the need for collateral to represent synthetic assets like in synthetix.

socketshot,"With the greatest respect you don't have a clue what you're talking about. The entire point of algorithmic stablecoins is that they don't require collateral. The entire point of algo-stables is that they are decentralised and uncensorable in comparison to the centralised stablecoins like Tether or USDC. They use game theory incentive mechanisms to encourage network participants to keep the price at peg. A good example of this is the coupon model in DSD. To date - they've been quite terrible experiments, only benefitting the rich. However as with all technology, iterations are required.

&gt; Stablecoins are the leaders?

You've completely missed my point here. You need to look into MakerDAO &amp; Dai to understand what I'm talking about. Decentralised Finance on Ethereum required stablecoins for it to work. People can't engage in financial activities and the associated risks of liquidation if the system is backed by volatile assets. This is where collateralised debt positions come into the picture.

socketshot,"The point of MakerDAO is that it allows people to create stable assets out of volatile assets. This is achieved by opening what is called a ""collateralised debt position"". 

- A user deposits or ""collateralises"" some of their own assets into a Maker vault (eg 10 Eth @ $1300 per Eth). 
- The user then has a balance of 10 Eth in their maker vault which they can use to mint Dai. 
- The protocol requires all minted Dai to be ""over collateralised"". This means for the 10 Eth in the vault you can only mint at most 5 Eth worth of Dai (aka 200% collateralisation).
- The user now has $6500 worth of Dai which they can pay back at any time to get their 10 Eth back.
- If the price of Eth was ever to fall below $650, the users collateralised position would be liquidated. This is the point of the over collateralisation requirement - it gives the user breathing room on the underlying volatile asset.

This approach to stablecoins falls under the category of ""collateralised stablecoins' and I believe the above explains your question about ""soft-pegging"", collateralisation = soft pegging.
I would also group RSR in this category, although their product is designed with very different use cases to Dai.

aqqlebottom,"When it comes to its trading structures, Uniswap relies on global liquidity pools and an automated liquidity protocol to facilitate the creation of distinct markets for each different asset combination. UniSwap is sometimes referred to as a decentralized exchange that enables automatic trading and the use of decentralized financial currencies, among other things. Hayden Adams, a software developer, developed it and released it on the Ethereum Network as an ERC-20 token in November 2018. It is now available for purchase on the Ethereum Marketplace.

Cons: 

•	Because Uniswap is non-custodial, it is just as secure as the Ethereum blockchain itself because the protocol does not hold any financial information. Several audits of the Uniswap smart contracts have been conducted, including audits by the same teams who verified the MakerDAO smart contracts.

•	To create liquidity for the new pool, ERC20 tokens and ETH need to be paired together. This means that you will get new tickets for trading far more quickly than you would with any other method now available.

•	The Uniswap exchange rate is dependent on arbitrage trading to keep it constant means that there will always be a need for other forms of exchange to keep it balanced.

•	Because of the greater risk associated with ERC20 to ERC20 token trades, higher gas prices are required. As Ethereum increases in scale (ETH2.0 sharding/Casper implementation is currently underway), gas prices will eventually become insignificant.

•	Unified Swap is still in the early stages of development; even their documentation has not been finalized. As the exchange's popularity increases, the true benefits, and disadvantages of using it will become more apparent.

•	The UNI decentralized exchange (DEX) token was created to be completely independent of other cryptocurrencies as a whole. Unfortunately, this has not always been the case.

•	The UNI token has no associated fees. Thus there are no charges connected with utilizing the protocol.

•	A consequence of the open-source nature of Uniswap similar DEXs (such as SushiSwap and PancakeSwap) is that they are vulnerable to imitation and duplication, which leads to a reduction in their market share.

•	The risk of momentary loss when traders supply liquidity to Uniswap may deter some traders from utilizing the platform.

•	Cross-chain decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Thorchain and Gravity DEX (Cosmos) may attract more traders in the future who are looking to trade across blockchains than Uniswap, which only trades in Ethereum ERC-20 tokens.

•	In contrast to trading on centralized exchanges, when you trade on Uniswap, you retain ownership over your private keys. While you are the custodian of your tokens, liquidity pools will trade directly with you while you are not. Due to the sole usage of smart contracts by Uniswap, the Ethereum network has incurred very high expenses. A smart contract is added on top of the transaction, which means that it does not occur directly between two users from a technical perspective. Consequently, users will be forced to pay fees twice when submitting tokens to the contract and again when sending tokens to the second recipient. When the market is volatile, both the number of transactions in the network and the cost of transactions in the network both rise as a result. If you sell your assets after they've started to decline in the liquidity pool, you'll incur much larger losses than if you keep them.

•	It is used by many fraudulent projects to promote their worthless tokens under tickers that seem to be legitimate currencies to trick consumers into buying their trash.

•	It seems doubtful that Uniswap will be legalized in the near future because it does not operate with fiat currency. The consequence is that those involved in projects and individuals functioning legally should take care while using any associated technology.

•	If Uniswap supports more chains, there is no indication in the project's strategy that this will be the case. At the same time, according to blocktivity.info, Ethereum transactions account for just 2.7 percent of all blockchain transactions in the United States.",2021-10-01 04:51:42

# USDC - the better Tether

USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin that is pegged to the price of the US dollar - so 1 USDC = $1. [It operates like this:](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/USD_Coin)

1. A user sends US dollars to the coin issuer's bank account.
2. The issuer uses a USD Coin smart contract to create the equivalent amount of USD Coin.
3. The newly minted USD Coins are sent to the user and the substituted US dollars are held in a reserve.

It was launched on September 26, 2018, in collaboration between Circle and Coinbase, and is an alternative to other USD backed cryptocurrencies like Tether (USDT) or TrueUSD (TUSD). [Bringing US dollars on the blockchain allows moving them anywhere in the world within minutes, and brings much-needed stability to cryptocurrencies. Additionally, it opens up new opportunities for trading, lending, risk-hedging and more.](https://cryptonews.com/coins/usd-coin/)

Being the second largest stablecoin, it undoubtedly has some inherent advantages - especially against its main competitor, Tether (USDC). These include:

&amp;#x200B;

# Very reliable leadership team &amp; founders

* USD Coin is [developed by the Centre Consortium](https://www.centre.io/usdc), a partnership between Circle and Coinbase. The technology and governing framework are developed by Centre, while Circle and Coinbase were the first commercial issuers of USDC.
   * Circle is an [official Money Transmitter](https://www.circle.com/en/legal/us-licenses), which makes the company an open financial book, connoting that all USDC tokens are regulated, transparent and verifiable.
   * Additionally, Circle is one of the only crypto companies [backed by Goldman Sachs](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/goldman-sachs-backed-circle-goes-live-with-currency-linked-stablecoin-and-anyone-can-issue-it-2018-09-26), a renowned investment bank.
   * Coinbase, the other 'half' of the Consortium, is the world's second biggest crypto exchange with billions of dollars in daily volume, so it is highly unlikely that they will perpetrate a stablecoin scam.
   * Moreover, Coinbase stock is already on the market while [Circle plans to go public via a SPAC](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/cryptocurrency-company-circle-to-go-public-in-spac-deal/) \- which incentivizes them to keep running the USDC project lest their stock prices plummet.
* Meanwhile, Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin in the world, has only 13 employees and is the [most valuable company on a per-employee basis in the entire world](https://cryptowhale.medium.com/the-tether-scandal-the-biggest-threat-to-the-crypto-ecosystem-23a169003205).
   * This is similar to the Madoff Ponzi scheme of the early 2000s, in which he robbed $65 billion of investors' money.
* Thus, USDC is the largest trustworthy stablecoin in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

# Reserves are safe and are audited every month

* A top 5 accounting firm, Grant Thornton, releases audits of Circle's reserves every month. Its [August report](https://www.centre.io/hubfs/pdfs/attestation/2021%20Circle%20Examination%20Report%20August%202021%20Final.pdf?hsLang=en) revealed that:
   * There were no discrepancies in the market cap of USDC and the value of Circle's reserves.
   * The reserves themselves consisted of 92% cash &amp; cash equivalents, 1% corporate bonds, 5% USD denominated Certificates of Deposits, and 2% commercial paper.
* [In a crisis, there’s a strong chance that Circle would be able to meet significant USDC redemptions, if not instantly, then within a short timeframe. Putting it another way, if regulators bring in rules about the quality of assets that need to back stablecoins, it’s likely that USDC assets would easily comply.](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/circle-publishes-details-of-usdc-stablecoin-asset-backing/) And that can’t be said for Tether by a wide margin.
* The degree of transparency and quality of Circle's assets is significantly superior compared to USDT, where the asset backing raised concerns at the [Boston Federal Reserve](https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/speeches/2021/official-monetary-and-financial-institutions-forum-fed-week-financial-stability-session.aspx) and [Fitch](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/fitch-flags-stablecoin-risks-to-short-term-credit-markets/).

&amp;#x200B;

# Plenty of native uses as opposed to USDT

* Coinbase offers [no fees when spending USDC](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/pricing-and-fees/) using the well-known Coinbase Card.
   * This incentivizes Coinbase users to utilise USDC to spend, rather than other cryptocurrencies.
* [VISA recently became the first major payments to allow the settlement of transactions in USDC.](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.releaseId.17821.html)
   * While this doesn't benefit consumers as of now, it allows crypto-holding companies such as [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) and Tesla to natively transact USDC on VISA, eliminating the need to convert their crypto to fiat.
* Compare this to Tether, whose only 'partner company', Bitfinex, is actually the entity that controls USDT itself.

&amp;#x200B;

# Available on a variety of blockchains

* [USDC is powered by an ERC-20 smart contract in the Ethereum blockchain and is also supported on other blockchains (Algorand, Solana, Tron, Stellar).](https://swissborg.com/blog/usdc-vs-usdt) It is an open-source project, which makes it a transparent and verifiable stablecoin on the blockchain.
* In addition, in the next few months [Circle is planning to add USDC to 9 more blockchains](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/06/29/usdc-stablecoin-could-soon-expand-to-10-more-blockchains/), including Avalanche, Celo, Flow, Hedera, Kava, Nervos, Polkadot, Stacks, and Tezos.
   * This will put it significantly ahead of USDT, which only supports 7 blockchains as of now.
* Each network has its own perks and flaws, all of which comprehensively make USDC more useful than it ever was.

&amp;#x200B;

# Can be staked for yields

* [By staking USDC, you can earn](https://www.blockfer.com/earn-interest/stablecoin-interest-calculator/):
   * 8.6% APY on BlockFi
   * 8% APY on [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com)
   * 11.55% on Celsius Network
   * Native earnings if you hold it on Coinbase
   * ... and many more options

thePhileazy,"Copy and pasted this from a similar post I tried to answer:

TraderJoe and Penguin Finance - Blue chips of Avalanche network. Trader Joe is an all in one Dex, AMM and yield Farm where lending and borrowing is supposed to come soon too. Penguin Finance is a great yield farming platform where you can stake LP tokens of multiple dex’ and AMM’ to gain additional rewards. They are also very active and are developing further products and an NFT series with utility.

Teddy.Cash and Everest Options - my favorite small caps, even-though teddy has had a pretty big pump already but is dipping a bit at the moment, so might be a good time to get in. Teddy and it’s stablecoin TSD is like the MakerDAO and Dai of Avalanche and it’s first native stablecoin. Everest is a options trading platform for tokens on Avalanche which launched about a week ago, so it’s still pretty early

Lastly, I usually Farm on ElkDex. It’s a smaller Dex, AMM and yield farming platform, but has a pretty nifty Impermanent Loss protection feature. It’s native token also has utility as a cross-chain token which allows you to easily transfer Elk between the Avalanche, BSC, Huobi Eco, Fantom and Polygon blockchain, with more being added over time.

Grayscale® Digital Large Cap Fund and Grayscale® DeFi Fund Announce Quarterly Rebalancing of Funds  
Smart contract platform Solana and decentralized exchange Uniswap have been added to the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund  
October 01, 2021 17:57 ET | Source: Grayscale Investments  
  
...  
New York, Oct. 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grayscale Investments®, the world’s largest digital currency asset manager, and manager of both Grayscale® Digital Large Cap Fund (OTCQX: GDLC) (the Digital Large Cap Fund) and Grayscale® DeFi Fund (the DeFi Fund), today announced the updated Fund Component weightings for each product in connection with their respective quarterly reviews.   
  
In accordance with the Digital Large Cap Fund’s construction criteria, Grayscale has adjusted the Digital Large Cap Fund’s portfolio by selling certain amounts of the existing Fund Components in proportion to their respective weightings and using the cash proceeds to purchase Solana (SOL) and Uniswap (UNI). This announcement follows the July 2021 news that Grayscale adjusted the Digital Large Cap Fund’s portfolio and purchased Cardano (ADA), and is the first time Solana (SOL) will be included in a Grayscale investment vehicle.   
  
Solana  
  
SOL is the native token of the Solana network, a smart contract platform first conceived by Anatoly Yakovenko in a 2017 whitepaper. Like the Ethereum network, the Solana network is one of a number of projects intended to expand blockchain use beyond just a peer-to-peer money system. The Solana protocol introduced the Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism as an alternative to pure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains like Ethereum. PoH is intended to provide a transaction processing speed and capacity advantage over traditional PoW and PoS networks, which rely on sequential production of blocks and can lead to delays caused by validator confirmations.   
  
Uniswap  
  
UNI is the native token of the Uniswap network, a decentralized exchange originally conceived in 2016 by Vitalek Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, and later developed in 2018 by Hayden Adams and Uniswap Labs. Uniswap enables trading of digital assets without a central order book by aggregating digital asset trading pairs using smart contracts. On Uniswap, users exchange digital assets with one another by paying a transaction fee to independent market makers called liquidity providers. Holders of UNI have the ability to propose and vote on improvement proposals to adjust features of the Uniswap network.   
  
At the end of the day on October 1, 2021, the Digital Large Cap Fund’s Fund Components were a basket of the following assets and weightings.  
  
Bitcoin (BTC), 62.19%  
Ethereum (ETH), 26.08%  
Cardano (ADA), 5.11%  
Solana (SOL), 3.24%  
Uniswap (UNI), 1.06%  
Chainlink (LINK), 0.82%  
Litecoin (LTC), 0.77%  
Bitcoin Cash (BCH), 0.73%  
No new tokens were added or removed from the DeFi Fund. At the end of the day on October 1, 2021, the DeFi Fund’s Fund Components were a basket of the following assets and weightings.  
  
Uniswap (UNI), 45.20%  
Aave (AAVE), 14.11%  
MakerDAO (MKR), 7.84%  
SushiSwap (SUSHI), 7.18%  
Compound (COMP), 6.73%  
Synthetix (SNX), 6.29%  
Yearn Finance (YFI), 3.92%  
Curve (CRV), 3.53%  
Bancor Network Token (BNT), 3.04%  
UMA Protocol (UMA), 2.16%  
Neither the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund nor the Grayscale DeFi Fund generate any income, and both regularly distribute Fund Components to pay for ongoing expenses. Therefore, the amount of Fund Components represented by shares of each fund gradually decreases over time.

This press release is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or solicitation would be illegal, nor shall there be any sale of any security in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of that jurisdiction.  
  
About Grayscale® Digital Large Cap Fund  
Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund enables investors to gain exposure to a market-cap weighted portfolio of large-cap digital currencies through a singular investment vehicle without the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping digital currencies directly. Through a rules-based portfolio construction methodology derived from the CoinDesk Large Cap Index, the Digital Large Cap Fund targets coverage of the upper 70% of the digital currency market and is re-evaluated each quarter; however, the weightings of each Fund Component change daily and are published around 4:00 p.m. NY-time.\*  Additional information on the Index methodology can be found at: https://tradeblock.com/markets/dlcx.  
  
The Digital Large Cap Fund's investment objective is for its Shares to reflect the value of Fund Components held by the Digital Large Cap Fund, less its expenses and other liabilities. To date, the Digital Large Cap Fund has not met its investment objective and the Shares quoted on OTCQX have not reflected the value of Fund Components held by the Digital Large Cap Fund, less the Digital Large Cap Fund's expenses and other liabilities, but instead have traded at both premiums and discounts to such value, with variations that have at time been substantial.  
  
The Digital Large Cap Fund is an investment vehicle with Shares titled in the investor’s name, providing a familiar structure for financial and tax advisors and easy transferability to beneficiaries under estate laws. Additionally, Shares are eligible to be held in certain IRA, Roth IRA, and other brokerage and investor accounts.  
  
About Grayscale® DeFi Fund  
Grayscale Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Fund holds digital assets that make up the CoinDesk DeFi Index. These digital assets are drawn from the universe of investable digital assets native to decentralized finance or DeFi. The Index methodology includes liquid DeFi assets on a market cap-weighted basis and is re-evaluated each quarter; however, the weightings of each Fund Component change daily and are published around 4:00 p.m. NY-time.\* Additional information on the Index methodology can be found at https://tradeblock.com/markets/dfx/.  
  
Grayscale intends to attempt to have shares of this new product quoted on a secondary market. However, there is no guarantee this will be successful. Although the shares of certain products have been approved for trading on a secondary market, investors in this new product should not assume that the shares will ever obtain such an approval due to a variety of factors, including questions regulators such as the SEC, FINRA or other regulatory bodies may have regarding the product. As a result, shareholders of this product should be prepared to bear the risk of investment in the shares indefinitely.  
  
 \*The compositions of the Digital Large Cap Fund and the DeFi Fund are evaluated on a quarterly basis to remove existing Fund Components or to include new Fund Components in their portfolios, in accordance with the Construction Criteria established by Grayscale or the Index Provider, as applicable.  
  
About Grayscale Investments®    
Founded in 2013, Grayscale Investments is the world’s largest digital currency asset manager, with more than $41.5B in assets under management as of October 1, 2021. Through its family of investment products, Grayscale provides access and exposure to the digital currency asset class in the form of a security without the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping digital currencies directly. With a proven track record and unrivaled experience, Grayscale’s products operate within existing regulatory frameworks, creating secure and compliant exposure for investors. Grayscale products are distributed by Genesis Global Trading, Inc. (Member FINRA/SIPC, MSRB Registered).",2021-10-02 08:59:11

I_LOVE_MOM,"Existential question about dApps: 

Every change to the code of a defi protocol has a nonzero chance of causing a serious bug that results in loss of funds. Whether this is a 2% chance or a 0.00002% chance is up for debate, but there is a chance. 

Does that mean, given enough time and protocol upgrades, that every major upgradable dApp is destined to suffer a similar or worse fate than Compound? After all it only took until proposal 62 for an upgrade to cause major damage on compound. Do you really think we can get to thousands of merged proposals on MakerDAO and not have a single loss of funds?

After all, it may only take one major bug to kill a dApp.",2021-10-02 15:18:33

no-nonsense-crypto,"If code is law, yes.

But code isn't law. It's *mostly* law in crypto and DeFi, because for the most part, code does what it's intended to do and when it doesn't, governments usually can't do much about it. But sometimes the chain isn't decentralized in some way, which allows the a ""legal under the law of code"" action to be reversed or mitigated. For example, in an extreme case, hack victims had enough clout to execute a 51% attack on their own chain (see [the DAO hack](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao)).

If a hacker who has executed a flash loan attack is caught by agents of a government, then effectively, *law* is law. But it may be that when that happens, the law will just decide that code is law, or they may decide that code has to be written in such a way as to conform to certain laws.

Ive been thinking about Societe Generale (French bank). They applied for a 20M loan on makerDAO using their OFH bond token as collateral. Thru this theyll get 20M worth of DAI which they in return can play around.

LongForWisdom,"For what it's worth, from the introduction of MCD, MakerDAO was never intended to have solely decentralized (as in trustless crypto) collateral. The plan from that point was to have as much diversification in the portfolio as possible, including crypto-assets and real-world assets across as many different jurisdictions and entities as possible.

For me (and I think most at Maker) when we refer to DAI being decentralized we refer to.

* Lack of centralized control over the token DAI itself - not upgradable, not blacklistable.
* The idea that the collateral portfolio should not be controllable by any one entity or jurisdiction (but *not* that it should be entirely backed by trustless assets, which is generally agreed to not be scalable enough to allow us to produce the amounts of DAI that we'll need to if it is successful.)

Naturally the amount of USDC and dollar-backed stablecoins in the protocol stretches this significantly, and does represent an existential risk. Hence the multiple initiatives to reduce that reliance.

*However,* the introduction of stuff like other RWA collateral, Société Générale bonds, and the other types of collateral proposed in Rune's latest post is consistent with the idea of a token that is not exposed to existential risk from any one jurisdiction or entity - a decentralized DAI.

Regarding governance itself, there are definitely a number of downsides of on-chain voting, and it's fair to say that voters do not always understand the consequences of their actions.

The positive side is that bad decisions can directly result in financial pain for those that made the decisions. (IE screw up - mint MKR - devalue MKR token.) Which at the very least is preferable to many legacy systems where the negative outcomes of screwed-up decision-making do not land at the feet of those who most deserve it.",2021-10-07 01:15:59

nikola_j,"As others suggested, they're basically for different purposes.

ETH-A is the classic Maker CDP that can work for either way, while ETH-B is there for people who want to maximize their liquidity usage or leverage level (usually these people ride it quite close to the edge, with constant monitoring or some form of automation on it), while ETH-C is really best for long term borrowings where you would be making a highly collateralized position in any case.

Quick comparison of current stats for anyone out of the loop:

* ETH-A: 145% min c-ratio; 2.5% Stability fee
* ETH-B: 130% min c-ratio; 5% Stability fee
* ETH-C: 175% min c-ratio; 0.5% Stability fee

Here's where ETH-B shines:

* ETH-A starting with 5 ETH and \~2x leverage gives a liq. price of \~$2.600.
* ETH-B starting with 5 ETH and \~2x leverage gives a liq. price of \~$2.330
* ETH-C starting with 5 ETH and \~2x leverage gives a liq. price of \~$3.050
* ETH-B starting with 5 ETH and a liq. price of \~$3.050 allows you \~2.9x leverage.

JeffBezosNewWife,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/30/societe-generale-applies-for-20m-makerdao-loan-using-bond-token-collateral/,2021-10-09 01:30:50
nikola_j,"&gt;What's the point of all this?

Safety and convenience. You want to keep max Dai available for minting somewhat limited, so in case someone finds an exploit for minting free Dai they couldn't abuse it too much. But you also want there to be sufficient Dai available for minting so we don't stall with minting like it used to happen before. And so nowadays each \`ilk\` (collateral type) has it's own ""hard"" and ""soft"" ceiling, as well as that gap to which the protocol adjusts each x hours.

This whole mechanism is called ""Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module"" and it was first suggested [over a year ago](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/debt-ceiling-instant-access-module-pre-mip-discussion/3924) and then gradually implemented for all vault types.

The way it works is through these three most important parameters:

* \`line\` - the ""hard"" debt ceiling where a governance vote is needed for changes
* \`ttl\` - the time that needs to pass between soft debt ceiling changes, where each x hours the ""soft"" ceiling is readjusted
* \`gap\` - the amount above the current debt of a certain collateral type the ""soft"" ceiling will be adjusted to

tl;dr - Yes, there's an automatically adjusting soft limit for Dai minting, as well as a hard limit that can only be changed by MakerDAO Governance.

On top of a rapidly expanding nonfungible token community, the Fantom network can now add a multi-billion-dollar DeFi protocol to its list of accomplishments thanks to the successful launch and liquidity build of Geist, a decentralized non-custodial liquidity market protocol where users can lend or borrow crypto assets on the Fantom protocol.

Since the launch of the Geist protocol on October 5, the platform has rapidly ascended in the total value locked (TVL) ranking and has accumulated more than $11.1 billion worth of locked value as of October 8, according to the Geist Dashboard. The rapid rise in TVL on Geist confirms an active and involved community and solid backing from well-funded sources.

Assets locked on Geist include $2.44 billion worth of Tether (USDT, $604 million in Fantom (FTM), $1.3 billion in DAI, $2.32 billion in USD Coin (USDC), $2.81 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH), and $1.62 billion worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).

According to data from DeFi Llama, a TVL of $11.1 billion makes Geist the sixth-largest protocol by TVL of all DeFi platforms, placing it in the league as some of the largest and most well-established protocols on the Ethereum network such as MakerDAO and Compound.

ApoIIoCreed,"There seems to be a lot of discourse on this MakerDAO subreddit regarding the burnrate of MKR – the age-old “use cashflow for dividends” vs. “use cashflow re-investment” debate. The reddit Maker community seems divided on the best path forward and it seems that nearly every thread has the two camps slinging mud at each other.

In contrast, the users on the official MakerDAO governance forum acknowledge that Maker is in a high-growth tech sector and that the best way to grow faster than the competition is through direct investment. They generally seem far more informed about how MakerDAO is using funds to invest, and far happier with the state of the project and tokenomics.

Personally, I think the difference in sentiment is due to an information imbalance between the DAO forums and the subreddit – those with less information on the status of the DAO’s projects and spending are the angriest about anything that interferes with the MKR supply reduction.

Well, most other tokens are pegged coins. OHM has base collateralization but is not pegged. Although there is an assumption of future stability. This increases decentralization. I think those properties are in line with general trend in Defi of decoupling from USD.

They have been able to buy up their liquidity tokens. We used to talk about TVL. But TVL is not sticky. Olympus has excelled in the newer and, imho, more interesting metric POL (protocol owned liquidity).

And now there is Olympus Pro, which makes liquidity buy-back through bonds a service. A bunch of projects already jumped onto the bandwagon (Abra, shapeshift...). Usage of those bonds support Olympus treasury and is pumped back into growing OHM. There are also incentives coming for use of OHM in treasuries.

Olympus DAO the organization has shown itself to be very apt and innovative with OHM and then the bonds and Olympus Pro and community building. Actually I think they are the some of the most successful builders I have seen in DAO land. Compare, say, with MakerDAO.

There's also the gamble that a POW version of ETH will live on after the Merge, thereby leaving another ETC free money dumping situation. This won't be available to any ETH locked in the deposit contract.

&gt;My darkest timeline is Erigon leading the way for the old POW chain. They've been hating on the difficulty bomb in the past, both Alexey and Artem in old tweets. Which made me wonder, why is something so trivial so important to them? Total speculation here with horrible odds but I can't let it go. Didn't help that Erigon skipped out on the interop event in Greece.

&gt;Obviously the lasting POW chain would be a mess with all the stable tokens committing to POS, amoungst many other things.

&gt;However there's still a small chance to me we'll see a contentious split.

I wanted to reply but I think this is deserves to spawn a discussion.


I've been thinking about this and I may be wrong but hear me out. 



**Ethereum Is Unforkable Due To DeFi** 


Here's my thought process:


Bitcoin is a simple blockchain - no smart contracts.  One token, one consensus. Any contentious changes that causes the blockchain to split, results in users having free coins on the other chain (because of their access to the private keys on the other chain). We have seen this numerous times: Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, BitcoinZ, etc. 

There are no negative consequences for forking Bitcoin...to be more specific - there are no unintended consequences for forking Simple Blockchains.

We have also seen this in Ethereum with Ethereum Classic. For those unfamiliar with the DAO hack, [here's a nice summary from Gemini] (https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao#section-what-is-a-dao). After the DAO hack in 2016, the 'Code is Law' group spawned Ethereum Classic from the resulting chain split. Ethereum was ~1 year old and the ***community*** decision to hard fork and return the stolen ETH was a tough but necessary choice. Imagine trying to implement PoS today when a single address held 3.6 million ETH.

***Ethereum Today***

The building blocks of DeFi are stablecoins. [Currently Tether and USDC make up ~60% of all stablecoins on Ethereum.](https://defipulse.com/usd) For better or worse, these two stablecoins are custodial and centralized. They are an IOU token that, in theory, should allow users to redeem them for $1 USD. From these stable coins, we get the numerous other applications that we find in DeFi. Money Legos. Everything built on top of each other. This composability aspect of DeFi is great for creating novel applications. However, if one piece breaks, the rest of the ecosystem will suffer the consequences.


MakerDao's Dai was thought to be a fully decentralized stablecoin initially backed only by Ethereum. But the need for Dai's growth and liquidity, resulted in MakerDao's governance incorporating USDC into it's balance sheets. [USDC now represents over ~50% of all Dai generated.](https://daistats.com/#/)


Let's focus on USDC because I believe it's the main reason why a minority chain can never exist.

USDC represents ~$30.22 Billion that is being circulated on Ethereum. If a minority group were to ever split the Ethereum Network, there would now be two copies of all tokens and all stablecoins. And because USDC is an IOU token, there can only be one official record of that token to be redeemed. [CENTRE, the group behind USDC,](https://www.centre.io/usdc) will have to choose a chain to support and blacklist the addresses on the other chain. 


Whatever chain CENTRE chooses, the other chain will fall apart. 

* USDC becomes worthless 

* Dai becomes worthless 

* The entire Curve market place falls apart due to USDC and DAI losing their peg

* USDC/DAI debt is now effectively paid off for free 

* Liquidity Pools that are paired with USDC are drained as users quickly try to get rid of USDC 

* Lenders of USDC/DAI cannot get their USDC back in time and are left holding bags of worthless USDC/DAI tokens. 

I could go on and on. The outcome would be horrible as the entire DeFi space on the other chain is crippled.



**Author's note**: *It was at this point I came across this article while writing this -_- it seems someone smarter than me has had this thought before but I'll continue with my thought process and add it as supplemental reading material. Glad I was on the right track though.
https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/ethereum-is-now-unforkable-thanks-to-defi-9818b967738f*

In it's current state it would take Miners, Node Operators, Exchanges, and Custodial Stablecoin Operators to choose the chain to support. 

And a quote from the article I just found that summarizes it better than I could have:

&gt;What this little thought experiment tells us is: Ethereum is not what it used to be. In 2016, Ethereum was still a proof of concept, and ETC could plausibly claim to be a better vision of how the “world computer” should evolve. But today, it’s clear that ETH is valuable because of the systems that exist on top of it.

They also said to mentally prepare for it to take a few months since they need to develop some things in order to come up with a general solution that can help others in the future if anyone else ends up in this situation. They said, as far as they know, that no one has. I do know one guy accidentally sent a little over forty ETH to his Binance address on Arbitrum and Binance was telling him there was nothing they could do.

samsimon123,"Flare direct competitor to Ethereum (ETH) smart contracts, NFTs. Songbird is open systems and people will build things with them that we haven't thought of yet. But being able to have smart contracts for layer 1's that don't have them, the state connector, the decentralized built-in oracle, an EVM that works much faster than on Ethereum, being able to trade various L1s on a DEX, decentralized governance, all open up a lot of potential. It's super cheap fees (transactions), secure, fast, uses almost no energy. This is the best network for smart contracts. Use cases: Paying transaction fees, FTSO vote delegation, Minting F-assets. Use in apps being built on the network like Flare Finance and Trustline. The simple fact that a SGB/Flare wallet will be able to hold anything bep 20, erc 20, xrpl is game changer and you'll be rewarded for bringing on those assets.

The real power in WSGB is that it utilizes a detachable voting function for the FTSO and governance functions of the network. This also means that users can deploy the WSGB token in DeFi protocols or elsewhere while simultaneously voting in governance and earning inflationary rewards in SGB on a weekly basis through FTSO delegations to signal providers.

Matt Rosendin of Trustline recently announced that they will be launching their decentralized stablecoin protocol, Probity, on the Songbird Network sometime in October. Probity has a similar design to MakerDAO in that it takes collateral from suppliers and borrowers to mint and issue stablecoins. On Songbird Network, it would be expected that WSGB will be the collateral of choice. Once live on Flare Network, Probity will feature FLR and FXRP as premium collateral.

FlamesRiseHigher,"*I'll preface this by saying I do have a small amount of my portfolio in Olympus.*

There's been a lot of craziness with OlympusDAO in the past 24 hours as many have been discussing. I had a bout of insomnia last night so ended up following along live as the price basically halved. It was actually pretty interesting. /u/CaterpillarKitchen67 suggested I come back and do a write-up about it if I find any info on what caused all this, so this is my attempt to explain what went down.

The general game theory strat behind Olympus is the whole ""(3,3)"" thing, where the value goes up if everyone stakes and holds. It's certainly has a ponzi effect, which I suspect may inevitably lead to volatile periods. The insane staking APY (currently %8000) is set to go down over time so I do personally believe that OHM could achieve more stability in the future. 

In any case, the more degenerate strategy employed by Ohmies as of late is called ""(9,9)"", where they can take their sOHM and use it as collateral to borrow against it. Of course, they then reinvest in Olympus and get more sOHM. I think this was also likely a factor in the exponential price growth we saw recently. The most popular vault I saw people discussing using for this (9,9) strategy was ""Tetranode's Locker"". Tetranode is a whale who's well known on crypto twitter (CT). His locker is a Fuse pool on Rari where participants can borrow against up to 76% of their sOHM. This led to a lot of people with risky liquidation prices. What happened last night was a liquidation cascade which caused a lot of people to lose their sOHM. It seems to have been caused by a whale, but it's unknown if it was done on purpose or not. Here's a tweet  ([https://twitter.com/sayinshallah/status/1448998447340732423](https://twitter.com/sayinshallah/status/1448998447340732423))  from one of the Olympus guy's on CT about a whale doing a max borrow limit with 30m, so seems like that must be what triggered it, but whether they just fucked up or were trying to make this happen seems to still be up in the air. If you want more info, @sayinshallah works for OlympusDAO and will likely keep posting updates as they learn more.

*Just a side note here, but while I was researching this I came across this stat on CT:* [*https://twitter.com/adampatel23/status/1448891525853765650*](https://twitter.com/adampatel23/status/1448891525853765650) *. OlympusDAO made up 58% of Sushi's volume in a 24 hr period. Crazy!*

In addition to this, last night Banteg (Yearn Finance dev) posted this tweet ([https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1448476044713922568](https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1448476044713922568)) about some concerns that MakerDAO folks had with OlympusDAO's keys. The actual Maker forum discussion can be found here: [https://forum.makerdao.com/t/ohm-olympus-dao-collateral-onboarding-application-mip6/10709](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/ohm-olympus-dao-collateral-onboarding-application-mip6/10709). I think this is kind of moot already as Olympus already announced ""Olympus v2"" which moves everything to a new contract, so the necessary changes will be made to correct that. Additionally they're adding community governance through a ""gOHM"" token. You can read about Olympus v2 here: [https://olympusdao.medium.com/introducing-olympus-v2-c4ade14e9fe](https://olympusdao.medium.com/introducing-olympus-v2-c4ade14e9fe) 

In the end, I think Banteg's tweet ended up only fanning the flames a little, but ultimately it wasn't an impetus of this volatility, nor does it seem it will be a concern much longer. 

**TLDR** is basically: Ohmies got too risky with their borrowing and got caught in a liquidation cascade caused by whale who was either an idiot or acting maliciously.

My personal feelings on this are basically ""I'm not shook"". This DAO has proven that they can be great innovators and are willing to think outside the box. This is experimental economics so events like this will happen from time to time, but I can't help but believe in their goal of becoming a decentralized reserve currency. Additionally, OlympusPro's bonds are very interesting to me and I think could provide a real service to many DeFi protocols. 

Also please don't take this as an endorsement to buy now. DYOR, it's a complex economic model with some ponzi-like effects that I fear will inevitably lead to these hype trains / volatility till the APY eventually comes down.",2021-10-16 00:44:23

thebestboner,"The MakerDAO Protocol Engineering team was able to get my ether back! 

I honestly cannot believe this. As soon as I realized what had happened, I was positive it was gone forever. I cannot describe how grateful I am. These guys had no obligation to me whatsoever and yet they still took the time to figure out how to do something that many people, including myself, thought would be impossible. 

I'm not exaggerating when I say this ether is almost everything I have in the world. I've never made very much money. My car is twenty years old and trimmed with rust. I was lucky enough to learn about Ethereum in 2017 and ever since then, invested invested a hundred bucks or so out of every paycheck, sometimes not even leaving much left over for food. All my tax returns went into Ethereum. All my covid stimulus money went into Ethereum. These guys were able to return all of that. All of that time, all of that hope. I am so grateful for what they've done. Thank you!

I also want to say thank you to everyone here who read my posts and offered advice. Thank you! When I first posted here, I had no idea where to turn. It was you guys who steered me in the right direction and helped me get in contact with the right people. And it was your comments of support that helped me through those first few days.

13blues13moons,"Ok so Maker is a token on the Ethereum network, and it's part of the Dai protocol (as a governance token). Thus people using the system and wanting to participate in governance, that's what drives up the price (or, it's a factor). Traders wanting to buy Maker and sell for a quick profit, they also influence the price. 

So, right now there's big news in both the Ethereum corner, and the Bitcoin corner. Remember, limited resources means limited choices. A lot of people right now just want to buy ETH and stake it, or at the very least hold on to it. Also, to use MakerDao you have to spend ETH. So, maybe if people think ETH is going to explode in price, or gives them better earning opportunity, not as many people will want to pay the fees. Or, they will use the ETH for other things like AAVE or Compound.

graph_marine,"I'm not big on price predictions, because I don't know when they will come to fruition and I don't know what the future holds. However, I can give you some data points to work with and I can also give you my personal thoughts on where we may end up in the next few years. 

&gt;Monthly query growth: \~20% (on average since 2019)  
&gt;  
&gt;Total queries in June 2021: 30 billion billion  
&gt;  
&gt;Total queries in October 2021: 46-60 billion  
&gt;  
&gt;Daily queries: 1 billion (last quoted June 2021)  
&gt;  
&gt;Number of subgraphs: 22,000  
&gt;  
&gt;Estimated cost per query: $0.00017-$0.000017

Some of this information has to be taken with a grain of salt, however. For the past two years, The Graph was a hosted network on AWS and was provided as a free service to developers who created decentralized applications. Most of the activity was on Ethereum, until The Graph provided support for an additional 23 EVM-compatible networks (eg, Polygon, Avalanche, BSC, etc.). Most of the data above is based on Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks, and is not representative of the number of queries The Graph will receive once it completely indexes and supports Solana, Bitcoin, Near, Polkadot, etc.

Developers who want to create applications on these networks almost universally use The Graph. If a new developer wants to create a new subgraph on The Graph's network, they'll need GRT to pay for the queries that their subgraph/dapp yields. That's why there will always be demand among developers to have GRT. If The Graph is supporting a dapp, and it goes down, the dapp does not function. These dapps are onboard as well, and will be paying for query fees because it is faster, cheaper, and decreases their bottom line to do so (rather than indexing these chains themselves). See AirSwap's community decision on the matter for reference: 

[https://snapshot.org/#/vote.airswap.eth/proposal/QmRqyFdwa1SQQuVPgn816CfxnTCUqRkVa25LmVozxwQcRb](https://snapshot.org/#/vote.airswap.eth/proposal/QmRqyFdwa1SQQuVPgn816CfxnTCUqRkVa25LmVozxwQcRb)

I'm kind of rambling here, but the bottom line is - The Graph makes it easier for developers to create applications. Aave, Uniswap, Sushiswap, Pancakeswap, EIP1155/EIP721 standards (ie, ALL NFTs on Ethereum and other chains), MakerDAO, Balancer, Synthetix, all ***rely upon*** The Graph to function. If you believe blockchain-based decentralized applications will continue to grow in development and use over time, and if you believe in the networks that The Graph supports, including Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Near, Celo, and others, then GRT's token price will exponentially increase as long as Web 3.0 continues to grow.

I think $10 within the next year or 2 is inevitable. I'm hoping for/thinking of $50 by 2025 and $100 by 2030, though I could be underestimating the future potential of Web 3.0.",2021-10-16 05:47:27

GrilledCheezzy,I just found out about alchemix  which I found interesting bc the collateral you provide is used for farming while you have taken a loan against it. So it earns a yield which slowly pays back the loan automatically. A bit of added risk for sure that the collateral in another project like sushi could be the victim of an exploit but that’s always a possibility with all of the dapps really.  I found that to be very interesting. I use bprotocol right now which is built on top of makerdao but it provides a unique liquidation protocol for other applications that it integrates with. You can earn their tokens while you borrow your own money. So I migrated my cdp to bpro bc I thought why not if it’s just sitting on top of maker anyway.,2021-10-16 23:12:14

The Original Defi Platforms set the foundation for what future DeFi applications will be building on (MakerDao, Compound, Aave, Uniswap, Yearn, Curve, etc.) These will probably stay the foundational building blocks for all of DeFi.


These DeFi 1.0  projects spawned a host of copy/paste projects with minimal changes (new token name or a changed variable), on the Ethereum network and on other EVM chains.


DeFi 2.0 uses the 1.0 platforms to create something new or create new efficiencies within the 1.0 platforms.

You're literally just spreading straight up misinformation. The graph you posted maybe can get away with not being technically a lie, because it just says, ""Total"" for the Y axis, and you could claim ""total"" means anything since that's a vague term that nobody uses.

Rest assured however, if you're thinking that means ""Total Value Locked"", you'd be wrong: UniSwap's TVL is just under $5 billion. The graph says they have a little over $10 billion.

Your claim, that this means ""treasury"", is wrong: see MakerDAO over on the left of the graph? Their treasury contains over 3 billion in stable coins alone--orders of magnitude more than any claim about Olympus, and that doesn't include non-stable coins.

Maybe you think it's market capitalization: that's the first possibility where any of the numbers on the graph were maybe correct at some point, but if that's the case, then the graph is leaving out a ton of major projects which are larger than Olympus.

In short, I have no idea where you got this graph, or where the graph got its numbers, or even what the numbers are supposed to represent, but Olympus isn't close to being the second largest project on any metric I can see.",2021-10-17 04:28:14
TREYisRAD,"TVL is mostly meaningless, and it's definitely not the metric I'm showing here. I'm certainly not confusing market cap. What is being show here is what matters: \*Protocol Controlled Value\*

Who cares if Uniswap or Maker have multi-billions in mercenary capital locked in their system? That capital can move elsewhere in an instant. 

PCV is what the Protocol Owns, and as token holders / DAO members, the number that you should care about.

[Maker has $56 million of DAI in their treasury](https://openorgs.info/organization/makerdao). Not $3b. Stop spreading misinformation if you do not understand the difference between value locked in a protocol and value \_owned\_ by a protocol.

[Olympus has the highest](https://i.imgur.com/33OautZ.jpg) % ownership of non-native vs. native protocol tokens ownership in their treasury. Here's [more charts](https://dune.xyz/shadow/Olympus-(OHM)) to digest.

\*What does this mean?\*

It means if UNI were to go to $0, UNI token holders would be entitled to nothing. The protocol treasury owns nothing except now-worthless UNI tokens. If OHM were to go to $0, token holders would still be entitled to a half-billion dollar treasury of non-native tokens. 

And that treasury is growing very quickly. The Olympus Pro Bonds-as-a-Service program has been wildly successful in just its first couple weeks, generating tens of millions. And there are dozens of additional protocols waiting to be onboarded to the service.

Naturally, the market would decide that OHM \_won't\_ ever go to $0, because of that PCV backing the value of OHM.

If Olympus' revenue stays at the current rate, then the PCV grows by $100m per month.

That means the \*baseline market cap of OHM is growing by over $1b/year\*

And remember: \*99% of protocols have a baseline market cap of $0\*. They are \_purely speculative\_.

And Olympus' revenue is only accelerating. $1b/year is extremely conservative.

What will happen when APY is reduced to single-digits, and `1 OHM == PCV / Supply`? 

Well, as revenue continues to be added to the PCV, the value of OHM will simply go Up Only... for as long as the protocol is revenue generating. As a token holder / DAO member, you are entitled to your share of that treasury. You are effectively investing into a bank vault that is growing every second.

Again, I implore you to do more research. You seem to not grok PCV and it's implications for a DeFi protocol.

Worst Case is your CDP loan gets liquidated and you lose your ETH collateral in the CDP but you still get to keep earning your leveraged 3crv earnings. The alETH loan will eventually pay itself off so you never ""really lose your ETH""... (however long that will take).


Your CDP debt could be reduced by deleveraging from your 3crv pool and paying back some of the debt in case of an ETH price drop.

For proof of work, eventually it’ll only be the wealthy that can afford specialized mining hardware, which then gives them a lot of control because now they can control the processing of transactions.

Both cases mean that there still is centralization happening, except this time it’s free from regulation and now the rich are truly able to do a lot of money laundering if they wish. Not to mention the environmental harm it does despite it processing in many orders of magnitude less than the current financial system. ETH’s proof of stake is shit in that regard, while still being better than a lot of proof of work. Proof of work is just flat out terrible.

MrQot,"Because if you had 1 ETH before the merge, you'll have 1 ETH on the PoS chain and 1 ETH on the PoW chain. Which is the ""real"" ETH? Which one will you be able to bridge to other chains like Polygon, using the existing bridge smart contracts? It'll be whichever one is deemed [legitimate](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) by the community and market at large.

But it's not just eth, it's *all* the value locked in DeFi on Ethereum. If you had 1000 USDC before the merge, now you have it on both chains. But it's not like you magically made $1000 out of thin air, only one of those will be legitimate and redeemable. Same for NFTs, same for all the tokens out there. 

If you have 1000 DAI on both chains well, MakerDao ultimately sets the price and the price depends on what the oracles say the price of ETH say. So if MakerDao decides the PoS-ETH chain is legit, then the PoW-ETH oracle will be shut down or feed a value of $0 per ETH which would most likely fuck shit up on PoW-MakerDao and liquidate everyone's collateral. It's not impossible for part of the community to fork MakerDao as well and recreate DAI but it would be a lot of effort.

The DAO hard fork was in Ethereum's infancy when DeFi was barely a thing. The price of 1 ETC diverged for 1 ETH according to the market and that was it, but now the whole game is different.",2021-10-18 22:30:26
frank__costello,"&gt; it will be perfectly functional

DeFi will be completely broken on any fork

First of all, any fiat-backed stablecoin (USDC, USDT, etc) and even WBTC will be completely worthless. That means that the millions of dollars of liquidity in DEXs will allow buying ""forked ETH"" for $0, meaning the price of forked ETH will crash in price, bringing down many protocols that rely on ETH as collateral.

Plus, oracles will not be updated on the new chain, meaning any oracle-dependent application (MakerDAO, Aave, Compound, Synthetix) will completely break.

With the entire DeFi ecosystem collapsing and the price of forked-ETH plummeting, it's hard to imagine there will be any value left on chain. If people want a cheap EVM compatible chain, there's already many better alteratives.",2021-10-18 22:39:50

tldrthestoryofmylife,"Small nit: The problem isn't what it's backed by, rather the lack of transparency around the whole thing.

Personally, I'm a Cardano bull; Charles and friends have researched into creation a new type of stablecoin called a Djed that's a perfect example of this. It's like a MakerDAO pair with mathematical assurances; you can verify mathematically as part of the implementation that the price will not rise or fall beyond a certain tightly-bound threshold and that there will be no bank runs (where the last guy to pull his money out finds nothing remaining).

That's an example of a system with ""monopoly-money"", i.e., synthetic money printed against the ""real"" value of gold or \[laughably, but in theory\] USD. The difference between a bank and a stablecoin system like Djed or MakerDAO -- the latest in decentralized stablecoin protocols -- is that the former is subject to no transparency requirements relative to the latter and pretty much allows them to do whatever they want to get a profit on *their* side (particularly in revocation of Glass-Steagall, which allows banks to do literally whatever they want with the money in your 0.5-1% APY savings account.)

You're not wrong in that the money needs to be backed by ""real"" assets; however, some claim that faith in USD is given by faith in the US itself, i.e., its military power. My only point is that the whole thing revolves around *transparency*; even if the Fed deployed PowellCoin tomorrow, and the government itself offered better yield than USDC, it still wouldn't be good for the economy or the world b/c the Fed isn't transparent about the monetary policy and is thus obliged to do whatever the fuck it decides on the day.",2021-10-19 01:43:57

What's the percentage on this because I don't really see it.  Most of the money in defi is locked up in reliable projects.  It's only on the absolute fringes, the farthest out on the risk curve that you can possibly go that you start seeing rug pulls.  Go to a site like defillama.com.

You live life like a skydiver and if you can't die from it then what's the point of doing it?  There's protocols out there for you.

The initial loan was collaterized with only a relatively small percentage of my ETH stack, but it was still a pretty sizeable loan. By the time ETH dipped below $100 I had had to put pretty much my entire ETH stack in the CDP to avoid getting liquidated. (I did not have access to enough cash to pay off the loan and did not want to sell my ETH during a big downturn). There was a happy ending to this, as ETH started recovering and ultimately was able to make a profit, but the constant fear of a sudden market crash and getting liquidated made it all very stressful.

swap_catz,"I would hold it and borrow against it with MakerDAO or Reflexer and buy ETFs. ETH might double so doing any defi with it right now isn't worth it since you don't have enough for full FIRE with just 50 ETH. Crypto rates are dirt cheap and just taking the 50 ETH and borrowing 50k to buy some broad market indexes is not the worst thing in the world.

Full disclosure since I'm bought in, but Tokemak looks promising to as liquidity options, but you will miss the upside of ETH.",2021-10-20 22:36:17

If you're a smaller Maker holder, the best thing you can do with your MKR right now is to delegate to one of the Recognised Delegates. There's a list of them [here](https://vote.makerdao.com/delegates?network=mainnet) and they each have profiles and stats to view to help you find someone that matches your priorities. 

Alternatively, if you have time and want to get more involved in the governance of Maker. We'd love to have you join the MakerDAO [forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/).",2021-10-20 22:50:17

ChanakyaZ,"&gt; So in conclusion, limit your exposure to stablecoins. Exit positions with BTC/WBTC as denomination.

I don't think BTC/WBTC is an alternative to StableCoins. StableCoins are generally of two type...

1. Pegged StableCoins, e.g. USDC/USDT/BUSD

2. Algorithmic Stablecoins, e.g. UST/RAI

DAI is a mixed bag by MakerDAO. It has both Pegged component, as well as Algorithmic component. Instability in Pegged component will disturb stability overall for sure. So, the true alternative IMHO are Algorithmic Stablecoins, e.g. UST/RAI. These are not battle tested yet though. Upcoming bear market will tell us how strong their algorithms are against a highly volatile market.",2021-10-20 23:30:53

rosadefoc,Do you see any risks in getting into MakerDao? Seems it has been lagging on the trend. Any reason i am missing?,2021-10-21 05:55:27
MerkleChainsaw,"I’m also on the fence. It has a wonderful mission and decentralized stablecoins are necessary for Ethereum to be the best it can be long term. It has a wonderful team who has pioneered in the space and truly wants good for the ecosystem rather than going for a money grab (see the recent post on them recovering funds for a user who made a mistake). It has as close to an equity / revenue sharing mechanism as you could hope for in a token. 

The part that scares me is it’s losing market share and the competition both for stablecoins and for lending platforms is only heating up, including action moving to L2s. MakerDAO needs to move quickly to stay relevant. I see they are working on a lot of interesting new areas, but it’s hard to judge  the odds of success.",2021-10-21 06:06:04
thebestboner,"Just want to give one final shoutout to the MakerDAO team. After everything else they did for me, they even sent out a [Maker Swag Airdrop!](https://i.imgur.com/KapZkEd.jpg)

Can't overstate how awesome these guys are!

Also, just an update regarding the transaction fees, since a couple people had asked. All together, the entire retrieval ended up costing around 2.2 ETH, which I was more than happy to pay. However, when I got in contact to reimburse, /u/chrisbducky from Oasis, let me know that they had already covered all the fees since this all happened on their site. Thank you, Chris! When all this first happened, I had no idea how helpful everyone would be. This is better customer service than I've ever had from a bank, and I hope it goes a long way toward boosting people's confidence in these projects and their teams.

Finally, I've gotten a couple messages regarding my personal security. Since my reddit username is now out there on twitter, along with my wallet address and how much is in it, I'm going to be taking their advice and ditching this username as well as transferring everything to a new wallet. I'll still be part of this community, it'll just be under a different name.

And again, thank you to everyone here who commented and took an interest. Without you, I would have had no idea where to turn, and things could have turned out much differently. Thank you, everyone. You have no idea how grateful I am.",2021-10-21 07:35:45
MerkleChainsaw,"That’s so great. I think before you go you should consider making a post on the cc sub with your story. First it’s a cautionary tale on ensuring which transactions are supported, but more importantly everyone should know how awesome the MakerDAO team is.",2021-10-21 07:44:28
iPeculiarly,"Hell yeah! Glad things worked out and I'm glad it was a fairly cheap hack back! I'm blown away at how well Oasis team / Makerdao team handled this. Makes me more confident in DeFi as a whole, especially makerdao / oasis!",2021-10-21 08:27:23

Basically in the near future, that sweet 5% APY you get just for holding Algo will be gone (scheduled for 3 months or so from now). You will get rewards by participating in the governance. This will have proposals most likely dealing with transaction fees, expansion of the network, etc. A typical Gov token like MakerDAO or Compound. 

The first gov period has just started, hence the large talk, and the first topic to be voted on is if there should be a penalty for people who pull out of gov early. So all these people pulling out now would lose 8% of their committed Algo for pulling out early. Right now they lose nothing, and if Option A win, it will remain this way. 

Gov in short terms is you ""commit"" Algo, each Algo is a vote. Then you need to vote on every topic. If you keep your wallet balance about the committed amount, and you voted in every topic, then you get the APY.",2021-10-23 04:26:42

BothEmergency,"&gt;How is UST differ to decentralized Dai stable coin?

##Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) Stablecoins

Provide Collateral (ETH, yvTokens) &gt; the Protocol lets you Mint/Borrow a new Stablecoin against your Collateral.

**Examples of CDP Stablecoins**:

- alUSD, alETH (Alchemix)

- MIM (Abracadabra)

- LUSD (Liquity)

- DAI (MakerDAO)

- RAI (Reflexer)

##Algorithmic Stablecoins

In the case of UST, there's a Symbiotic Relationship here.

Demand for UST goes up ↑ — More LUNA gets Burnt to Mint UST.

Demand for UST goes down ↓ — Some UST gets Redeemed for LUNA.

That's an Elastic Supply.[[1]](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1396368188900667398?lang=en) LUNA isn't gone forever.

Where's the Demand coming from? 

- IBC and Wormhole has been enabled, anyone can export UST to other chains (Solana, Osmosis, Secret).

- The Terra Spacecamp Hackathon had a vision of Projects increasing Demand for UST.[[2]](https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1439012005273296899)

- 90 Million LUNA will be burnt to fund Ozone in a week or so.[[3]](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1451439483140775938)

**Examples of Algorithmic Stablecoins**:

- UST, KRT, MNT, SDT (Terra)

- cUSD, cEUR (Celo)",2021-10-23 12:17:30

Price volatility is driven by speculation, the currency itself has nothing to do with that. Any currency which has a speculation market will be volatile, that's just a fact. If cryptocurrency were to be broadly treated as a currency instead of an investment by society (as intended), then these issues would not exist. Vice versa for any fiat currency, enough speculation will make any currency volatile. Also if you really need stability that much than projects such as MakerDao exist which pin the value of 1 token to 1 USD, while still remaining decentralized.

cryptOwOcurrency,"I'm sorry but this is one of the worst takes I've ever seen on Ethereum, and I've seen some pretty bad takes.

From a technology point of view, NFTs are about the least interesting thing happening on Ethereum right now and account for a small fraction of the transactions sent (and therefore the revenue the protocol generates in the form of fee burn). It's all about fungible tokens and DeFi. If Ethereum had NFTs but not DeFi, gas fees would be sitting at 10 gwei and the Ethereum network wouldn't even be profitable (deflationary) before PoW rewards like we are now.

Out of all the most important, interesting, and revenue-generating projects in the space - impermax, alchemix, balancer, uniswap, makerdao, liquity, opensea - only one of them has anything to do with art NFTs or art NFT platforms (though *useful* NFTs do have their place, such as representations of unique resources like ENS names, or LP positions).

The public face of Ethereum is NFTs, but the real party happens in the back, for people in the know. Learn more about DeFi and you will quickly realize that the NFTs the CNN talking heads are reporting on are just the tip of the iceberg.",2021-10-25 13:17:38

FamiliarDisaster325,"yea this is what i plan on doing too. if makerDAO or another lending dapp allows us to take DAI loans against our staked eth, that would be unreal",2021-10-26 01:01:51
DeFi_ance,"The arguments for it are that MakerDAO is prioritizing growth via re-investment over focusing on the deflationary aspect of allowing surplus to be burnt. And not only is burning rare at this point as the surplus is constantly raised and tapped for funds before it crosses the burn barrier, but yes indeed, they are now talking about issuing more MKR above the 1 million original cap to use for ""growth"" primarily for funding the dev team. The justification is that the powerful DAO players who are basically a voting cabal consider retaining the talent they have to be crucially important, and they *need* to be extremely generous to keep their talent and continuing developing new protocol expansions to pave the way for future growth of DAI utilization overall.

Personally, as a holder who is certainly no whale but has 5-figures in MKR, I am becoming disillusioned at this pivot away from the monetary caps that for so long was a hallmark of MKR's value proposition. I fear they're going to loot the protocol to subsidize the lifestyles and gains of the privileged insider devs/delegate blocs, while debasing the value of MKR for everyone else involved. Is my fear justified? Only time will tell. But I have been seriously considering lately selling off 90% of my MKR and taking those funds elsewhere for growth, probably just back in ETH itself.

It's a really unfortunate situation, because I understand their arguments about growth requires reinvestment to stay ahead, but I also see that as competition ramps up for the stablecoin market, they could end up losing the growth battle *and* eroding the investor-base's value through inflation. My confidence and enthusiasm for Maker has certainly been seriously shaken the past few months. I think even if this works out it's just going to result in them scaring off smaller holders who don't have much voting power or can't afford to delegate, which means the protocol's top voting blocs will just become even more entrenched and even more privileged. Shitty situation.

Go to the r/MakerDAO subreddit and sort by top, this has been discussed plenty in the last few months, and the community seems pretty split on it.",2021-10-26 04:04:11

Lazy_Physicist,"I remember reading that the maker dao plans to take all their usdc and put it into a usdc-dai pool or something. That way the usdc is generating value for the protocol via fees and maintaining a liquidity pool while mitigating any potential freezing issues with usdc. Itll essentially remove the risk of the protocol being backed by frozen usdc and replace it with a LP which could potentially be frozen while not impacting maker directly.

Rune4444,"I have been making some proposals about my vision for how we can bring maker governance on a more powerful path for long term growth and value creation, and to support the Clean Money vision I recently proposed where MakerDAO will use its economic power to support environmentally sustainable projects in order to benefit from climate alpha, keep Dai stable, and provide Maker Governance with a more compelling purpose that will encourage more MKR holders to become active in governance. 

A part of those is to issue MKR in order to create staking rewards for MKR holders participating in governance, and do yield farming to expand MKR holders to a much broader group that could help getting more governance participation. 

The MKR issuance would not be used for funding the team, only for MKR holders staking rewards/yield farming. We do still need to grow the team further because of the immense complexity of the Maker system, and the goal is to do these things so we can simultaneously allow the team budget to grow to a point where it uses all profits to reinvest into growth, while MKR holders get their benefits and payout for being holders from the staking rewards.

There's already around 100 people hired by Maker in a completely decentralized and flat hierarchy. It still is just getting started, so a lot of transparency and reporting of results are missing - and to get these things properly in place, we need to find ways to get regular MKR holders squarely in the drivers seat of Maker Governance, and thats where things like staking rewards for participating in governance can have a huge effect. 

We have already begun to see some amazing results, such as work on a starknet L2 version of Maker, and some recent collateral onboarding results with extremely high potential collateral such as staked ETH or the Aave Direct Deposit Module, and of course the massive BD win with the collateral proposal from Societe Generale (third largest bank in frace). With strong governance in place we can support these efforts and create even more success, and in particular gain the capacity to begin large scale marketing.

PhiMarHal,"Everything about MKR is telling me to sell it. 

They likely have the greatest technical team of crypto, and they keep improving the protocol. stETH vaults are coming tomorrow. USDC reliance is decreasing every day. Their work is amazing.

But MakerDAO also had a history of throwing small users and holders under the bus, for the sake of insiders. Starting from the backroom VC deals at the beginning of the protocol, to endless ""sucks to be you"" answers whenever people got liquidated because of protocol flaws, oracle failures, gas congestion. Lavish spending on employees with little oversight or discussion.

Now these new tokenomics from Rune. Conveniently happening once there's no MakerDAO foundation anymore. The grand plan being to break their long-established social contract of 1M hard supply, and all for a vague plan of saving the world through investments in renewable energies. An industry that is rife with corruption and exploitation in real life.

I want to believe the pattern will be broken, because I tend to invest in fundamentals. But I think this is wishful thinking. MakerDAO will continue to deliver a fundamentally sound system to the whole crypto space. Yet the value created by that system won't accrue to MKR holders.

Still not selling. Definitely married to the bag. Here's hoping the above is all wrong.",2021-10-27 21:59:13

jvdizzle,"rETH is more than likely a security. SEC has already said crypto debt instruments are.under their purview. rETH is exactly that. The ETH providers are loaning their ETH to the protocol which in turn loans it to the node operators. This is why Coinbase Earn, most centralized and decentralized lending platforms are also securities.

RPL is bit more nuanced, since you can't earn yield on it unless you are also performing a service as a node operator.

Now question is: what would the ramifications be if SEC said Rocketpool is working with securities?

Well the smart contracts are all on the blockchain. The protocol is run by the oDAO and will eventually become more decentralized. This is a good buffer to regulatory oversight.

There are routes teams can take to become more decentralized and resilient to centralized regulatory oversight as well. MakerDAO is a good example. It is now fully decentralized and the foundation has stepped back from control of the protocol. Devs are just working on open source at that point, with no central organization pulling the strings.

I personally am not too concerned. Honestly the SEC will label the entire crypto industry as a security as long as they are incentivized to do so, which they are. It's up to the community to become more resilient to centralized oversight and control.",2021-10-28 04:13:21

samsimon123,"Full Interview On Thinking Crypto - Tony Edward Hugo Philion Interview Flare Networks SongBird Spark FLR Token Airdrop New Crypto Assets - https://youtu.be/d_wkq1fRRuU

Flare is a direct competitor to Ethereum (ETH) smart contracts, NFTs, etc. Songbird is open systems, and people will build things with them that we haven't thought of yet. But being able to have smart contracts for layer 1's that don't have them, the state connector, the decentralized built-in oracle, an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that works much faster than on Ethereum, being able to trade various L1s on a DEX, decentralized governance, all open up a lot of potential. This is the best network for smart contracts because fees are super low (per transaction), secure, very fast, and uses almost no energy. It’s great for: Paying transaction fees, FTSO vote delegation, Minting F-assets. Use in apps being built on the network like Flare Finance and Trustline. The simple fact that a Songbird/Flare wallet will be able to hold anything BEP 20, ERC 20, XRPL, is a game changer, and you'll be rewarded for bringing on those assets.

The real power in WSGB is that it utilizes a detachable voting function for the FTSO and governance functions of the network. This also means that users can deploy the WSGB token in DeFi protocols, or elsewhere while simultaneously voting in governance, and earning inflationary rewards in SGB on a weekly basis through FTSO delegations to signal providers.

Matt Rosendin of Trustline recently announced that they will be launching their decentralized stablecoin protocol, Probity, on the Songbird Network sometime in October. Probity has a similar design to MakerDAO in that it takes collateral from suppliers and borrowers to mint and issue stablecoins. On Songbird Network, it would be expected that WSGB will be the collateral of choice. Once live on Flare Network, Probity will feature FLR and FXRP as premium collateral. Additionally, Aurei (AUR), stablecoin of Probity, can be issued on the XRP Ledger with the Flare and Songbird Networks as the decentralized counterparty.",2021-10-29 23:27:54

PhiMarHal,"I think MakerDAO being battletested for 4 years means a lot, as anyone using L1 these days is likely moving significant weight.",2021-10-30 23:04:29
Njoiyt,"What I was trying to get at, is that it's better than makerDAO because maker uses a centralized stablecoin for collateral (USDC). This is a major issue in my mind.",2021-10-30 23:37:01
Revanchist1,"Are you worried about being liquidated? If you're not worried about that, why not use any of the other DeFi services. Borrow Dai using MakerDao CDP, Borrow MIM using Abracadabra, borrow LUSD being Liquity, etc.",2021-11-01 01:39:42
Revanchist1,"Abracadabra has taken a more progressive approach compared to MakerDao. 

Their approach to be on every chain and take on different collateral types is the primary reason for their growth. 

I'm also surprised MakerDAO hasn't voted to accept stable LP tokens as collateral yet.",2021-11-01 03:56:11
bronyraur,I feel like it would describing MakerDAO as mostly backed by USDC would be more accurate,2021-11-01 05:31:15
MrQot,"&gt;How does that impact token supply? 

It usually works on a mint/burn system on the non-canonical chain, i.e. 1000 coins exist on Chain A, you will lock them up by sending 10 to Chain A's bridge contract and receive 10 on Chain B. The 10 on chain B are minted on the spot and when you send it to Chain B's bridge, they're burned and unlocked on Chain A. The total supply is whatever Chain A's contract says it is, so it'll always be 1000. If the bridge has a bug/exploit, then an attacker could steal funds and mint a whole bunch on Chain B and mess with AMM's and pools and such, but he couldnt withdraw more on Chain A than there are actually locked in the bridge.

&gt;Is the contract address the same?

No, because the contract address depends on a bunch of things (contract code + transaction nonce + probably more) which *can* be the same since it's a deterministic process, but [it's a lot of effort](https://cryptobriefing.com/makerdao-team-recovers-63-eth-for-rightful-owner/)

For arbitrum specifically there's a whole setup to implement custom gateways or register a token on the generic gateway, pretty interesting stuff: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/bridging_assets",2021-11-01 09:49:56

samsimon123,"Flare is a direct competitor to Ethereum (ETH) smart contracts, NFTs, etc. Songbird is open systems, and people will build things with them that we haven't thought of yet. But being able to have smart contracts for layer 1's that don't have them, the state connector, the decentralized built-in oracle, an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that works much faster than on Ethereum, being able to trade various L1s on a DEX, decentralized governance, all open up a lot of potential. This is the best network for smart contracts because fees are super low (per transaction), secure, very fast, and uses almost no energy. It’s great for: Paying transaction fees, FTSO vote delegation, Minting F-assets. Use in apps being built on the network like Flare Finance and Trustline. The simple fact that a Songbird/Flare wallet will be able to hold anything BEP 20, ERC 20, XRPL, is a game changer, and you'll be rewarded for bringing on those assets.

The real power in WSGB is that it utilizes a detachable voting function for the FTSO and governance functions of the network. This also means that users can deploy the WSGB token in DeFi protocols, or elsewhere while simultaneously voting in governance, and earning inflationary rewards in SGB on a weekly basis through FTSO delegations to signal providers.

Lending through DeFi protocols like MakerDAO or Compound allow you to lend to people, and in the case that the debtor fails to make payments, their loan contract/CDP gets liquidated and you as the lender get your original loaned amount + any interest that was paid by the debtor during the life of the loan contract/CDP.

MrMoustacheMan,"#DAI Con Argument

*Disclaimer: my stablecoin holdings are spread across DAI, UST and USDC. As I take more profit this year DAI will become a bigger holding, but for now it's less than 1% of my portfolio.*

- DAI is notable as a decentralized stablecoin. It basically [functions as a loan taken against ETH or other collateral](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/a-guide-to-makerdao-and-dai).
- In a [market full of centralized stablecoins](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/stablecoins) the appeal is clear: no need to trust a central authority (see [USDT Con arguments](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og1sms/rcryptocurrency_cointest_top_10_category_tether/)) or worry about [getting blacklisted](https://cryptobriefing.com/100000-usdc-blacklisted-highlighting-importance-decentralized-stablecoins/).

- That being said, nothing is risk free and there are some potential aspects of DAI to consider:

##Backing

- As the name implies, 'multi-collateral' DAI is [backed by loans taken against multiple assets](https://share.streamlit.io/tadzz/maker_dai_collateralization_2/main/dai_collateral_app.py), not just ETH. I think a [multi-collateral model](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/#in-mcd-we-trust) helps to diversify risk instead of being backed by just one asset.
- But looking at the data you'll notice that a not insignificant amount of [DAI is generated from USDC](https://daistats.com/#/overview) and other centralized stablecoins. 

    - [USDC was added to help stabilize DAI's peg back in March 2020](https://news.bitcoin.com/makerdao-devs-debate-usdc-dai-liquidity-issues/). I think this decision exposed DAI to some risk, given the non-zero possibility of issues with USDC/Circle, such as concerns about regulation, rehypothecation etc. (see [USDC Con arguments] (https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og2nfy/rcryptocurrency_cointest_top_10_category_usd_coin/)). Would DAI's peg/liquidity be impacted if the SEC came down on Circle tomorrow?

- Does this mean that DAI loses some decentralization street cred? No, [according to MakerDAO](
https://blog.makerdao.com/busting-makerdao-myths-seven-misconceptions-about-dai/). 

    - However, some community members saw it differently. One forum member explained:

        &gt;""[there are new economical risk that can sneak in with such a solution and mixing it with an otherwise decentralized system ... I am in this project for it’s pure decentralized nature and would not want to see it becoming inter-mixed with USDC. If it were, I would rather just want to stick with USDC altogether.](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/onboarding-usdc-as-collateral-to-mitigate-liquidity-risk/1570/16)""

- Anyway we know [decentralization is a spectrum](https://nopara73.medium.com/few-words-on-decentralization-and-anonymous-payments-160782d30b9e), not a binary distinction. And it's the political axis of decentralization which I find more concerning, which takes us to...

##Monetary policy

- The rules that govern how DAI gets minted/collateralized and how it retains its $1 peg are sort of complicated for a lay user.
    - That's not a strong con in and of itself - most people interacting with smart contracts don't know how they work, you don't need to have a deep understanding of [how AMMs function](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/55m04x/lets_run_onchain_decentralized_exchanges_the_way/) to use a [DEX](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-decentralized-exchange-dex).

- Still, I think a [seignorage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seigniorage.asp) system like [how Terra mints its decentralized stablecoin UST](https://research.thetie.io/the-terra-triforce-rise-of-the-lunatics/) is easier for folks to use and grasp - no need to [maintain a CDP](https://media.consensys.net/how-to-open-a-makerdao-cdp-and-earn-interest-on-compound-a-walkthrough-guide-b9e9f9584000), just burn LUNA to get UST. 

- DAI fluctuates given the volatility of ETH and in the past the MakerDAO team have [debated different strategies to retain the $1 peg, including an 'emergency shutdown'] (https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/12/defi-leader-makerdao-weighs-emergency-shutdown-following-eth-price-drop/).

- The stability and collateralization of DAI is thus a function of MKR governance, which in my opinion has a lot of room for improvement:

    - There's a [lack of transparency](https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1197153771564019718) and a lack of participation, leading to [whales dictating monetary policy] (https://twitter.com/0xMako/status/1188824097918029825?s=21). To take a more recent example, a [proposal to remove USDT collateral passed with only 10 unique voters, one of which had 73% of the voting power](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmRNwrTy?network=mainnet#vote-breakdown).

- To me this is not the ideal of decentralized governance, but more akin to the Federal Reserve setting monetary policy.",2021-11-06 03:09:24

Papazio,"The story of the guy who tried to port his Maker CDP over to Arbitrum using Oasis.app where no such instance of Maker exists. Initially lost something like 60 ETH.

Guy posts on Reddit and peeps help him out with contact to the Maker team. The geniuses at Maker devise a way to potentially get the funds back, but say it is risky and will cost a lot of gas and might not work anyway.

The team goes for it and not only gets all his ETH back but covers the cost of the gas for him too. It just shows how close users, devs, and project leads are and how if you have an issue you should be able to easily get in touch and get help. Decentralisation does not mean 0 help.

noduhcache,"To explain a bit further, shiba is a non-native token instaminted on another chain, while doge is both a native token and a network, where the tokens have been issued to those who secure the network gradually over time.  

The difference does indeed matter.  I would encourage people to think about the ease of creating one vs. the other, and if something is easy to create, it can be end up being just as easy to discard.  When many people globally distributed must cooperate on the other hand not only to secure a network, but also to create infrastructure to make it accessible and then build adoption to use that infrastructure and liquidity to maintain it, that's a much more durable public good.  

There are examples of non-native tokens that have a different kind of investment of time and infrastructure to them, for example makerdao and dai.  But the principle still stands.

But being able to have smart contracts for layer 1's that don't have them, the state connector, the decentralized built-in oracle, an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that works much faster than on Ethereum, being able to trade various L1s on a DEX, decentralized governance, all open up a lot of potential. This is the best network for smart contracts because fees are super low (per transaction), secure, very fast, and uses almost no energy. It’s great for: Paying transaction fees, FTSO vote delegation, Minting F-assets. Use in apps being built on the network like Flare Finance and Trustline. The simple fact that a Songbird/Flare wallet will be able to hold anything BEP 20, ERC 20, XRPL, is a game changer, and you'll be rewarded for bringing on those assets.

The real power in WSGB is that it utilizes a detachable voting function for the FTSO and governance functions of the network. This also means that users can deploy the WSGB token in DeFi protocols, or elsewhere while simultaneously voting in governance, and earning inflationary rewards in SGB on a weekly basis through FTSO delegations to signal providers.

Matt Rosendin of Trustline recently announced that they will be launching their decentralized stablecoin protocol, Probity, on the Songbird Network sometime in October. Probity has a similar design to MakerDAO in that it takes collateral from suppliers and borrowers to mint and issue stablecoins. On Songbird Network, it would be expected that WSGB will be the collateral of choice. Once live on Flare Network, Probity will feature FLR and FXRP as premium collateral. Additionally, Aurei (AUR), stablecoin of Probity, can be issued on the XRP Ledger with the Flare and Songbird Networks as the decentralized counterparty.",2021-11-08 01:35:46

Dan6erbond,"I can try my best to explain the concept of tokens, assets and NFTs, so hope this helps!

The concept of a token is a asset on the blockchain, that contains metadata and in itself isn't really worth much. Just imagine it as an entry in an Excel sheet, but depending on how you treat that token, you can start to give it value.

A token like SHIBA gets its value from the hype and attention that it gets from the community. Tokens like BAT have value because you do something to earn it, and DAI gets its value from being used to govern the MakerDAO autonomous organization.

Now those are just tokens as a general concept. But there are three different kinds of tokens, not all of which are supported by all blockchains:

- Fungible Tokens (FTs)
- Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs)
- Security Tokens

A fungible token should be interchangeable with all its other representations. This is the case for all the tokens I mentioned above, since 1 SHIBA is the same as every other SHIBA. There's nothing unique about your SHIBA (in most cases, though, there can be exceptions here).

But NFTs are different. They're meant to be unique, and only one with that metadata and precise representation should exist. So think of artwork. Sure, I can create a copy of the Mona Lisa and hang it up at home. But the real thing only exists once. NFTs make it possible to tokenize unique assets on the blockchain, and assert their authenticity using cryptography. Lots of technical details that are luckily abstracted by blockchains like Ethereum and Solana.

Then there's security tokens. They go a bit against the idea of crypto, but Algorand and Cardano support them to be compatible with certain regulations. Security tokens can be unique like NFTs, or fungible. But in both cases, they can have managers, clawback addresses, etc. which are essentially users, or wallets, that can mutate the token. This can include changing the metadata, freezing it, taking it back, or destroying it. 

What I just described are the technical underlyings of how NFTs and tokens in general on a blockchain work. But what we conventionally refer to as NFTs these days are those graphics that are tokenized as NFTs. They're basically just images stored in the token metadata of the NFT you're buying, and as I mentioned, can help ensure that a unique artwork is actually authentic.

Blockchain really offers a lot of possibilities in this space. These images can be minted by a computer, i.e. generated based on various parameters, such as the person who's minting the NFT, which would visually change the actual image. It adds an aspect of uniqueness and rarity, which gives them their value.",2021-11-10 17:17:39

Lazy_Physicist,"SPELL is an interesting project to me because they seem to be hyper aggressive about taking different types of collateral in order to mint their MIM stablecoin. They collect minimal fees compared to MakerDAO and redistribute those fees in a very clear way (buyback SPELL with MIM fees and increase the ratio of staked SPELL (sSPELL) to SPELL). They use Kashi lending to isolate their lending markets to prevent contagion I believe so theoretically their hyper aggressive strategy of using yield bearing assets as collateral shouldn't be problematic if they onboard a lemon asset. Daniel (the creator) also seems to be incredibly aligned with the Ethereum ethos of freedom and self determination and has made more money than he probably knows what to do with from his bitcoin investments so I don't believe he will ever intentionally rug any of his projects. From the interviews that I've seen/heard he's also constantly thinking about cutting edge tokenomics to provide proper incentives for his protocols' users to keep his protocols healthy. Personally I think it's a good idea to hold at least some SPELL and stake it on mainnet to be exposed to it, but the danger is this hyper aggressive strategy could cause problems down the road if they move too fast. If you believe that maker DAO is too slow and cautious then SPELL is the protocol for you. It's incredibly risky right now but the rewards could be huge if the protocol manages to overtake Maker in market share.",2021-11-12 10:11:03

MrQot,"Kinda hard to tell from the lack of context and weird misuse of terminology, is he pro or anti L2 lol? I'll do my best either way:

&gt;It will have no effect on trading Eth and ERC20 tokens. 

The idea is these tokens will be bridged to layer 2, and the new projects will deploy on layer 2 exclusively and skip layer 1 altogether. So that includes tokens. There's a lot of innovation going on for example with MakerDao to have Dai be a fully cross-chain and cross-layer stablecoin or Aave to be a single deposit-once access-anywhere DeFi platform with their portal thing in the upcoming V3.

If he means no effect as in ""you still have to pay lots of fees to bridge to L2"" (common criticism) the answer is exchanges will adapt to offer direct withdrawals to rollups (as many are already doing today) so that's a moot point in the long term but definitely a concern if your funds are currently on L1 and you need to move them. But it's a one time fee essentially.

It will absolutely have an effect, but obviously if the team behind the token doesn't do anything to port to L2 it will be stuck on Layer 1 DEXes where gas is expensive. (There are some talks of bridging arbitrary tokens to Arbitrum and others, but afaik the science isn't fully in yet and idk what effect that has on L2 liquidity)

&gt;However ETH 2.0 is a hard fork, and should have a direct effect. 

What's known as ""ETH 2.0"" will eventually offer sharding which will help rollups scale even more by offering them more data. Layer 1 gas will stay expensive, as those shards will be data-only, not execution.

&gt;BUT the only caveat would be someone building a DEX that uses an L2 solution in the background to reduce those fees on traders

Not sure what he means by ""in the background"". If you're operating on a rollup, you'll be as aware of which rollup you're on as you're currently aware of which chain you're on (ethereum, polygon, bsc, avax, etc.) In fact the user experience as far as MetaMask goes will be the same.

&gt;You will however in those situations still have to know those solutions, and how to change the DEX's exchange setting in your transaction to take advantage of it

Again that's a weird terminology, not sure what he means by DEX's echange settings? If he means the MetaMask RPC endpoint, that's basically the same thing as switch from mainnet to polygon. It's not like you're on mainnet and have to tell the DEX to ""use layer 2 in the background"", that's not how it works.

A rollup is basically a distinct blockchain that commits data to ethereum's mainnet. So it can focus on scaling instead of having to bootstrap its own nodes and security solutions. That's the ""execution layer"" in the modular blockchain model.",2021-11-13 05:59:04

FaceDeer,"It really bothers me how much focus people in the cryptosphere put on the ""inflationary"" or ""deflationary"" nature of various cryptocurrencies.

For one, it's using the term wrong. In economics ""inflation"" doesn't refer to the *supply* of a currency, it refers to the buying power of a currency. If one day you can buy a loaf of bread for $1 and the next day it costs $2, then dollars are undergoing inflation. It doesn't matter how many dollars there are in circulation.

For another, a lot of cryptocurrencies *aren't* trying to replace fiat. Many cryptocurrencies have intended functions other than that. The purpose of MKR, for example, is to provide decentralized governance for MakerDAO and serve as collateral of last resort for the protocol. I could sell a loaf of bread in exchange for MKR but  that's kind of a weird thing to do.

Ether itself is not actually intended as a general-purpose buy-a-loaf-of-bread currency, even if you can potentially use it for that if you want. Its purpose is to *keep Ethereum running.* It's there to be used as a mechanism for incentivizing validators/miners and for spam control by serving as a payment medium for transactions. It doesn't necessarily need to have an incentive to spend it on anything other than that.

If you want something to replace the dollar with you should design a cryptocurrency with the characteristics specifically intended for doing that. DAI is a great example, it's quite explicitly meant to fulfill the role that dollars fulfill.",2021-11-13 07:54:42

patniemeyer,"With DAI the collateral is held entirely by the contract on-chain.  It is permission-less and trust-less on Ethereum.   This means that no one can take away your ability to put funds in or take them out and you don't have to trust that someone is holding fiat or other tokens in the real world backing it to keep it stable.  The stability comes from the incentives provided for people to trade on both sides of the equation.  DAI is ""run"" by MakerDAO, which is a DAO :) which is a decentralized autonomous organization that derives what control it has from ownership of its token.  My understanding is that there are still a few levers that humans can tweak in the event of extreme market situations (e.g. at one point I think they had a button they could push that would return all of the funds to the respective owners) but over time they are trying to get rid of those and make it completely autonomous.

What may have happened is that they thought they would get enough liquidity from Leash price to be able to make and sustain a stable coin but, that hasn’t happened yet. Not saying they’re sticking with SHI but, if they did, they do have a lot of Bone to ensure price stays at $0.01. In the past other governance tokens have been what’s maintained a stable coin. MakerDao is a governance token and it’s liquidity allows DAI to stay pegged to $1.00. All that being said, here’s what the article had to say.

“It is important to note that neither SHIB nor LEASH, which are currently high performers on ShibaSwap, will be the blockchain’s primary token.

aregus,"There’s many wrong assumptions here and I would suggest you to start slowly into defi instead of trying this. 

First there’s not aave wallets or coinbase wallets, only custodian and non-custodian wallets. 

Non-custodian wallets are the ones you generate with a web3 client like metamask or ledger live. The first one generates an standard hot wallet where transaction signatures are done directly from the client, and the second one is a hardware cold wallet, where you have to sign your transaction from your hardware device in order to confirm them. 

A wallet becomes a hot wallet in the moment you type the seed phrase in a machine connected to the internet, so hardware wallets displays the seedphrase on their own screen so ur seedphrase never touches an online machine (cold wallet). 

If you’re experimenting with DeFi or NFTs I suggest you to get a hardware wallet first before doing anything else, and please keep it as a cold wallet.

Custodian wallets are the ones generated by exchanges or services that holds your coins for you, like coinbase, binance, Celsius, etc. 

Now about the strategies, there’s 3 strategies explained in my comment above it’s not a single one:

- The first one is just buying n staking ohm forks it can be Klima, Time, etc or Ohm itself. The logic behind these ponzus it’s an algorithmic reserve token that aims to mitigate volatility on crypto by using their treasury funds to back the current price of the asset or at least as close as possible meanwhile is issuing new bonds to capture more value from new investors. Bonds are created by depositing certain assets into the treasury and usually offers a discount vs the open market.

Some forks twist the purpose of the treasury a little bit, like klima which is looking to inflate the price of carbon credits w this funds in order to ""save the planet"". 

The payment is good but the risks are high, specially when some of this tokens are priced multiple X’s vs their treasury funds so all of them are in a rush to get more people aboard before the next big crash (If that ever happens).


- The second one involves leverage and I would not recommend it for new people like you, but if you’re planning to invest in the ohm forks then your risk tolerance is pretty high. It’s actually very easy to do, just buy ETH from any exchange and move your funds to a non-custodian wallet so you can use the makerdao contracts. 

Just the standard oasis app &gt; ETH-A &gt; Multiply 

But any big pullbacks could liquidate you so careful w the leverage. 

- The third one requires a bit more experience on defi even if it has the lowest risk, because it requires to do some research on certain iconic projects like curve, yearn, etc and you may have to bridge funds in multiple chains in order to make the most of it. There’s many ways to pull this one but a basic setup is bridging your ETH to polygon, or just buy matic and buy ETH on polygon then deposit your ETH on aave and borrow against your ETH up to 40% of its value into stable coins. I usually borrow Dai cuz the APY doesn’t pump that hard but be aware that dai price can pump considerably when volatility is high. 

At 40% it means the price has to crash more than 50% in order to liquidate you, which is not going to happen overnight so you have time to payback some of the borrowed money to keep it at 40% TVL

Use your borrowed stables to provide liquidity to any project that it pays good, you can even bridge them from polygon to another chain. I’m currently in the nusd Pool of synapse on polygon and  G3crv of curve on fantom, both are making above 40% APY. 


Remember that ETH is the native token of ethereum, WETH is the erc-20 token of a synthetic ethereum and is backed 1:1 w ETH, also it’s the one you’re going to use in the above strategy. 

Read more about WETH in their website. 


Finally the risks are mainly contract risks (if the protocol is hacked then say bye bye to your funds), so try to get insurance before making any deposits into these pools it’s better to pay a small price for insurance than a very expensive lesson. Also you’re earning a high APY in most of this projects so it’s worth it.",2021-11-15 09:00:19

lawhoo_,"I think a split approach is probably the best solution to address both sets of stakeholders, if only because it has the benefit of smoothing out the shocks of a ""start""/""stop"" approach to burning/raising the surplus buffer.  Much easier to model out if you don't have to account for the fact the surplus buffer could just jump based on a vote (obviously it still good, but a constantly growing surplus would hopefully cause less need for it). Ultimately folks like certainty and if they can model out the surplus growth and the burn rate, I think that's better than an all-or-nothing approach.

I would have to think more on the right percentage split, but agree with you that it needs to outpace MKR vesting.  As I mentioned, I've only recently become interested in actual ins-and-outs of how MakerDAO actually works so I'm still learning on the sources/uses.",2021-11-15 22:13:11
svantetobias,"My two DAI cents as a long term MKR holder, but not active in the MakerDAO forums:

1. Every DAI in the Surplus Buffer should have a concrete safety reason for being there, based on historical needs or credible forecasts. Building up a bank instead of deploying capital is inefficient unless it serves a purpose greater than the opportunity cost it represents.
2. Any DAI income left over after that should be split three ways, depending on the efficiency in furthering the MakerDAO system:
   1. Invest in Core Units
   2. Lower the Dai interest rate (stability fee)
   3. Pay out to MKR holders via buy-and-burn

As long as this is the optimization framework we agree on, MKR buy-and-burn could be 0% or 95% of stability fee income.

Balancing the above budgets is extremely difficult and requires deep knowledge, large amounts of data and long term strategy. It's what a full-time CEO gets paid top salary to do in traditional organizations. And to not get burried in bureaucracy, the CEO makes these decisions without having to reach consensus with shareholders first. The CEO is measured on performance after the fact - the only way to make the process efficient.

Now, maybe MakerDAO can afford to delegate this function to a group of elected representatives who needs to come to agreement, but as you allude to yourself, coming to full MKR agreement every week on the Surplus Buffer size is an extreme strain on bandwidth.",2021-11-15 23:30:49

Last time I used MakerDAO it involved some type of auction, but in periods of extremely high liquidations you might have a lot of slippage, in addition to your liquidation penalty. Meaning in some cases you'll be penalized further.

mrcleansocks,"Yeah. So the “vehicle” right now on chain is just a transaction. What that transaction is on the blockchain is actually just a little bit of data added to the ledger stating a change 

Example 
Bob sent sally 45 LRC 

This updates the current state for everyone in ethereum so everyone knows it happened. Sending individual transaction was fine for years, but there is a finite amount of space per block. Each block adds a few hundred transactions every 30-50 seconds and equates to about 10-15 tps (numbers may be off here but they’re relative.)

What a roll up does is essential use the extremely small amount of space that each transaction uses and instead of saying 

bob sent sally 45 LRC 

The transaction might say something like 

“Batch 45683920” 

Inside this batch is all of the requests for state changes on the system. Bobs payment to sally, my payment to my girlfriend, minting tokens via MakerDAO, any and all sorts of stuff that could happen via the blockchain.  

Since some things cost more to do on ethereum, you pay a proportional amount of gas depending on what you’re doing. 

So technically if you and I were sharing “Batch 4568392” and we were the only riders. We might split the cost of gas 50/50 or 40/60 depending of the complexity of the transaction. Add another person into the batch and it gets cheaper. Add another person and it gets even cheaper. 

The overall gas fee for the batch is always going to be high, but the more people riding inside the batch, the cheaper seats become by the nature of us splitting the cost for the batch. 

Let me know if you need a better explanation.",2021-11-18 23:46:00

Shyler_,"Best stable coins in my opinion are the decentralized ones with good. UST by Terra Labs, MIM by [Abracadabra.money](https://Abracadabra.money), and Dai by makerdao. Terra and Spell are both going to sky rocket if the SEC cracks down on stable coins. 

MIM will have free bridges to all networks its on. On top of that Popsicle Finance will be a cross chain DEX that uses MIM for cross chain transactions.",2021-11-19 04:33:11
The_Houston_Eulers,"I don't know much about Decentraland or FWB, so I'd suggest these four:

1. MakerDAO - Used to support the DAI stablecoin.
2. UniSwap - Coin exchange that was one of the first major DAOs to airdrop its governance token.
3. Gitcoin - Used to fund open source software projects.
4. Ethereum Name Service - Maintains .eth addresses

They're all pretty well-established, and would hopefully have enough reference material to support your thesis.",2021-11-19 11:15:57

Like literally, all of these Cefi platforms just take a portion of your money and use it for Defi. They carry the same platform risks as using Defi but offer less rates because obviously, management fees!

But Ethereum is distinctly different - its a capital asset because its programmable, it's a store of value, and it's a consumable all at the same time. Unprecedented.

Here are some projects, mostly built on Ethereum, that are worth paying attention to (for now) and are 100% not scams or pump and dumps. This list doesn't even include burgeoning DAOs which are the single most exciting thing in the business world right now.

samsimon123,"Songbird is open systems, and people will build things with them that we haven't thought of yet. But being able to have smart contracts for layer 1's that don't have them, the state connector, the decentralized built-in oracle, an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that works much faster than on Ethereum, being able to trade various L1s on a DEX, decentralized governance, all open up a lot of potential. This is the best network for smart contracts, NFTs etc. because fees are super low (per transaction), secure, super fast, and uses almost no energy. It’s great for: Paying transaction fees, FTSO vote delegation, Minting F-assets. Use in apps being built on the network like Flare Finance and Trustline. The simple fact that a Songbird/Flare wallet will be able to hold anything BEP 20, ERC 20, XRPL, is a game changer, and you'll be rewarded for bringing on those assets.

The real power in WSGB is that it utilizes a detachable voting function for the FTSO and governance functions of the network. This also means that users can deploy the WSGB token in DeFi protocols, or elsewhere while simultaneously voting in governance, and earning inflationary rewards in SGB on a weekly basis through FTSO delegations to signal providers.

Matt Rosendin of Trustline announced that they will be launching their decentralized stablecoin protocol, Probity, on the Songbird Network. Probity has a similar design to MakerDAO in that it takes collateral from suppliers and borrowers to mint and issue stablecoins. On Songbird Network, it would be expected that WSGB will be the collateral of choice. Once live on Flare Network, Probity will feature FLR and FXRP as premium collateral. Additionally, Aurei (AUR), stablecoin of Probity, can be issued on the XRP Ledger with the Flare and Songbird Networks as the decentralized counterparty.",2021-11-20 02:30:00

LeagueGreedy,"I did something similar to this using CeFi and MakerDao. It worked out very well for me, but it was incredibly stressful, and I would not recommend it. The chances of getting rekt are way to high, and I literally had dreams/nightmares about ETH price dropping and losing everything. I use abracadbra right now, but instead of buying ETH, I yield farm with stable coins instead. That way I can make a little bit of money from DeFi, and I always have the money to pay back the loan incase ETH crashes.

Check out [coindix.com](https://coindix.com), it's like a yield aggregator for yield aggregators. My favorite being [beefy.finance](https://beefy.finance)

nostrademons,"NYC was formerly the center of the cultural universe - Wall Street (finance), Madison Avenue (advertising), Broadway (theater), SoHo (artists), Harlem (jazz &amp; blues), etc.

California has been giving it a run for its money for about the last 50-60 years, between Silicon Valley (tech), Hollywood (films), Livermore (nukes), defense, hippies, anti-war/nuke movements, etc.  It's an interesting rivalry, in that you rarely see overt challenges (well, except for snarky anti-tech editorials in the NYTimes), but both regions basically just keep doing what they're best at.

I'd say that NYC is still ahead in terms of sheer cultural output, but CA's industries are growing while NYC is declining.  Madison Avenue has basically been eviscerated by Google &amp; Facebook, which now control a majority of the global advertising market.  Silicon Valley's also mounting direct challenges to NYC's financial dominance with FinTech and crypto.  Robinhood, Coinbase, Stripe, SoFi, Kraken, MakerDAO, and Compound Finance are all in California; Gemini, ConsenSys, and Uniswap are in NYC.",2021-11-20 07:05:29

Kar27051,"Slight edit*

I agree, but people will still do it through the organizations they grew up trusting. People may be using blockchain in the future but they'll be going through businesses they trust.

Posts like these though, make it sound like everything is going to be replaced by the crypto version of it. Banks no more with MakerDAO. Credit cards become useless as everyone starts interacting with blockchain directly. Who will use twitch anymore when there's Theta? That kinda BS I don't really believe.

Crypto is here to stay, but that doesn't mean the whole space is full of winners. We shouldn't pretend crypto is a magic wonderland and everyone's bags are full of winners with infinite potential. Just makes me feel like its 2017 all over again (IOTA &amp; privacy coins were going to be the next big things, the multi-baggers we all dream of catching).

nikola_j,"MakerDAO is a decentralized finance protocol on the Ethereum blokchain which allows you to create collateralized debt positions where you deposit or lock in assets as collateral and mint or borrow Dai against your deposit.

The deposit you're making is not being sent to any kind of account or wallet. It's being locked into the Maker protocol's smart contracts which later on keep track of your current balances, including the amount of assets you deposited and the amount of Dai you borrowed.

The set of smart contracts that run the Maker protocol do have some variables that are being maintained by MakerDAO governance. However, there is no way for the governance or anybody else to have access to your deposited funds. Not unless a major security exploit is found, which is very unlikely at this point, but it's fair to assume that there always exists a chance.

In short, when you create a MakerDAO Vault, you're creating it within Maker protocol's smart contracts - the protocol gives your Vault a unique ID number and keeps track of your deposits and borrowings, without any person having any kind of direct influence on the process.

If you would like to learn more, I would suggest for example checking out the Maker Community portal which has some nice explanations (https://makerdao.world/en/learn/). Or if you want to dive deeper into how it all works, you may enjoy going through Maker docs at https://docs.makerdao.com/.

If you are interested in analysing on-chain transactions, you can select any random vault from https://defiexplore.com/ and take a look at the transactions where users create vaults, deposit collateral and generate Dai.

Alternatively, if you're looking for a way to try out creating one MakerDAO Vault for yourself, I can suggest going to https://app.defisaver.com/ (which is one of the management apps for Maker Vaults) and selecting the ""Simulation mode"" which then creates a sandboxed testing environment for you, with a 100 ETH balance, where you can try creating a Maker Vault, among other things.

I can absolutely understand your skepticism, but I implore you to keep researching and digging deeper, because the world of decentralized finance is an incredible growing ecosystem, with Maker being one of its core components.",2021-11-21 09:17:00

Você é rewarded por dar colateral para o projeto. Os projetos, por sua vez, exigem algum colateral de quem está emprestando (ex: eu deposito 60k USD de ETH e pego 40k USD de DAI/USDT, etc). O risco que você corre é o preço do que o cara botou de colateral cair muito e você ficar xupando o dedo.

Para ser justo, projetos como o MakerDAO já enfrentaram quedas de ETH de mais de 90% quem quebrar.

Mas com certeza existem riscos que se corre. 8% em dólar com stablecoin é algo bem maneiro. Vale alguma alocação para quem entende e tem o perfil de risco (ex: é novo e conseguiria trabalhar novamente e recuperar o dinheiro em caso de default)

DAIJustinCase,"I'll try to give you some answers.  


1. As the value of the collateral decrease the ratio will decrease, as an example from 200%-&gt;180%. Nothing happens immediately following a decrease but at some point you will hit the liquidation threshold. Once you do, the collateral is automatically auctioned off and the debt paid. This is called a liquidation. 
2. Keepers doesn't step in as such. When a vault falls below a certain threshold it gets liquidated. This means the collateral is sold off and the debt is repaid. This is done at a given percentage and varies according to vault, but is always higher than 100%.  The sale is triggered and done by an automated auction system. Keepers are buyers of collateral in such auctions. 
3. MakerDAO is an automated protocol. A vault will be liquidated and closed before it ever becomes undercollateralized. If someone opens a vault and never comes back to it, eventually interests are going cause a liquidation assuming the value of the collateral doesn't keep growing enough to compensate. If the fall is very steep it is possible that some vaults may end up undercollateralized before getting liquidated, but the protocol is taking steps to minimize the risk of this happening.",2021-11-22 20:44:36

chinjila,"&gt;With Proof of Work I can see CPU being volunteered to keep the chain   
alive in exchange for tokens, but in Proof of Stake I don't see how   
Staking benefits the blockchain or incentivizes people to contribute   
hardware resources to help keep the chain active. Can someone explain?

Proof of Work is in a way converting the energy used in mining into $$ value to ensure block creator has a ""Stake"" in the fairness of all participants. In another word, by investing in the hardware and computing resources as ""Stake"" in the network, miners are rewarded for keeping the ""Consensus""of the network fair. 

In light of the energy waste and climate impact, we can eliminate the layer of ""Energy to $$"" and simply have the participants put up money (Stake) to validate the correctness of block via attestations. Validators are penalized via slashing and miss attestation penalty if they are not keeping up their end of the deal. Thus greatly reduces the energy consumption while maintaining the security of the chain.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; How exactly do all the validators know if the transaction took place/is   
valid? What's the mechanism by which we all detect falsehoods and reject  
 a new block?

Validators receive scheduled attestation on each block and attest for the transactions in Mempool.  The chosen proposer of the block must get 66%(I think) of scheduled validators to attest for the block to earn the block proposal reward.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I see smart contracts as problematic in more complicated scenarios. Say   
instead of using eBay, I use a smart contract to buy a widget. Sellers   
ships it, I receive it, but the widget is broken. Or what if the buyer   
pretends they never received the widget. Wouldn't we need a third party   
to resolve the issue? Smart Contracts seem too rigid and permanent for   
this use case.

Smart contracts deal with tokens, tokenization of real world assets are underway by MakerDAO and other folks. IIRC there is a fractionalized ownership of real estate properties that one can buy on Uniswap. The Decentralized Autonomous Organization(DAO) are commonly the consensus to handle human dispute. For example, Nexus Mutual is a decentralized insurance where claims are approved or denied based on DAO consensus. Smart Contracts will not replace all human transactions, it is not meant to. Buy/Sell physical goods will largely remain off-chain transaction and perhaps immutable recordings being on blockchain.

Sorry, I can't answer all the questions, but these are what I know that may help you out in some way.",2021-11-23 00:01:04

MinimalGravitas,"As a fairly vocal crypto advocate (check my comment history) and long term investor, yea this probably isn't a terrible idea to be honest.

In the grand scheme of things crypto mining isn't a huge chunk of our GHG emissions, but it probably is one of the few areas that can realistically be stopped without massive resistance from society. ICE road vehicles, international travel, beef and dairy all probably need to be cut massively if we are going to have a hope of maintaining anything like the levels of agriculture we need to support the global population in the mid future... but it appears that pretty much no government is willing to push for the end of any of that as quickly as is needed (i.e.  yesterday). At least killing crypto mining would be a relatively easy (if minor) win.

That said, I do still think crypto as a coordination tool might be the exact thing we need to help us avoid the massive web of 'Tragedy of the Commons' scenarios we're all caught up in that seem to prevent us taking the action needed to dodge the oncoming Great Filter. This concept was played out in one way in Kim Stanley Robinson's excellent novel 'Ministry for the Future', and is often discussed in one way or another in the crypto community.

If you're interested and open minded enough to actually look at some writing from advocates a good overview to start understanding how crypto people look at coordination problems like climate change would be: https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/ethereum-slayer-of-moloch- I'd recommended skipping down to the subtitle ""I'm a child of the last bull phase"" and reading from there as the stuff before that is irrelevant.

Another good example, more recent and more specific is MakerDao (one of the biggest DeFi platforms) pivoting towards climate focused public goods: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-case-for-clean-money/10684 to put this in context Maker has about $18 billion in on-chain locked value, which means they could feasibily represent a measurable percentage of sustainability funding in the areas they decide to focus on.

In short, maybe crypto mining does need to die, but at the same time I'm pretty sure crypto coordination tools and vast sums of young money can also probably help us fight climate change.",2021-11-24 07:03:37

i saw what solana was doing and was not impressed. u need specialised hw to run a node, the devs shut down the blockchain to fix xyz lol. this flies in the face of what decentralisation is about, same with bsc

but if u wanna figure out if algorand is trash i.e improves scalability at the expense of decentralisation or security lookl at how the consensus algorithm is centralised, dpos being obne of the most infamous examples (exchange wallets forked STEEM blockchain to collude with justin sun who took over the blockchain)

reading about agora

&gt; Algorand does this by selecting validators randomly from all token holders. The network relies on an algorithm that automatically picks the next group of nodes that become eligible to add blocks. This approach maintains decentralization since everyone can be selected by the system. The fact that no one knows who the next validators will be ensures security, which is another important element in the trilemma. 

i dont buy  that randomly selecting a validaitor solves the trilemma. you still need consensus via a gossip protocol to nodes what the chain tip is, 

to get more scalability ideally you need sharding. random node selection helps as block validation for a turning complete blockchain with lots of operations is expensive esp if there is network bound operations eg calling some oracle to get data e.g. current price of eth in makerdao

even sharding has limits, u can so easily seperate execution pn diff shards where one operation is not ready on another. usually its split into stuff kuije data storage and opcode execution

imo blockchain can never come close to a cenbtralised counterpart; its simply defies laws of physics. ina decentraliosed system. u need to propagate blocks over tcp/udp. amongst validators. those operatioons are slow, million times or more then just doing it all iin one api/ sservice in a traditonal software solution",2021-11-24 15:20:23

suninabox,"&gt;What do you mean by ""after 11 years""?

Bitcoin launched in 2009. Since one of your links included Bitcoin clearly its part of what we're discussing.

&gt;DeFi has been a thing for not even two years.

MakerDAO launched 4 years ago but whatever, it makes no difference because we'll always be 18 months away from any of this being used for anything but speculation.",2021-11-25 05:35:21
i_have_chosen_a_name,"Stablecoins run on faith. About 40% of the backing of USDC is USDT. the USDC was minted when Circle got USDT as collateral. 

Not only that but some stable coins have as backing a mixture of short and long positions on the same crypto. 

There are hardly any stable coin, probably not a single one that are fully backed by hard cash on a bank account. 

These stablecoins are being kept stable by

- Faith

- Arbitrage

And when Tether liquidity pops and 80% of liquidity is left the arbitrage that is active in the system that keeps these stablecoins stable will start to fail.

Every single stablecoin will be affected by a combination of arbitrage breaking down and loss of faith.

Some stablecoins will survive, their pegs will come beg to one.

Some will not. 

I just hope DAI will survive. It's over over colletorazided   but 40% of it's backing is USDC and one a deep enough market crash it's peg will break unless MakerDAO votes to push the emergency button.

I think even Dai will sell 90 cents on the dollar for a while but while most likely the first one to get a 1 dollar peg again.",2021-11-25 13:11:46

pongvin,"I do agree with you in general about innovation but there's ways around this. MakerDAO is a good example of a novel business model. A foundation bootstrapped it, took profits, then left it to the DAO. Now anyone could clone it with lower fees - except they can't, because making the Maker system less profitable would also make it less sustainable, lower it's dev velocity, and therefore making it less stable and more prone to being overtaken by competitors in terms of services.

There's a huge amount of continuous off-chain work done by the DAO which can't be cloned, that's their added value that the fee pays for. Collecting a fee that CAN be forked away just simply isn't a good business model on open chains. Which if you think about it isn't bad for the end user, because it means that greed plays little part in setting those fees.",2021-11-26 08:10:12
M00N_R1D3R,"You are doing very good job explaining how the formal proofs work in programming and what do they do! There a lot of issues with the approach, though, let me outline them briefly.

1) Hard to prove stuff which is about economic agents. It is not directly about the behavior of smart contract, it is about the market and the assumptions you impose on it. Impose wrong assumptions - and prove security where you actually don't have it.

2) Your example about secure hashing algorithm is a bit misleading - these things are largely conjectures in cryptography, and are far from not only a formal proof, but any proof. Secure hashing, for one, implies P!=NP.

I would also like to point out that formal verification systems are very much possible and used for normal languages like Python or even Solidity. Makerdao DAI smart contracts, for example, ARE formally verified.",2021-11-26 13:24:48

nikola_j,"Thanks for bringing this topic up, it really is important to improve UX associated with this process.

Besides the forum and this subreddit, I think twitter and discord announcements coordinated with any integrators could certainly help reach more people, too.

Imho, it would be great if these kinds of events could be announced via the main, official @MakerDAO twitter account, as I believe the broader community still maybe doesn't recognize accounts such as @MakerGrowth *as* official (and it certainly doesn't have as large of a reach).

I know that the @MakerDaiBot also posts these protocol changes, but those are very quickly burried by other bot posts.

For the most recently offboarded AAVE, BAL and COMP we at DeFi Saver tried notifying (to be) affected users with in-app notifications, as well as discord mentions, but it wasn't the best of efforts and we can certainly improve on this, too.

One comment I've heard from affected users is that they feel that the whole process happened way too quickly for something so important (with some adding that they even try to keep up with Maker Governance in general). The most relevant time period in this case is the one from the point the executive passes and until liquidations start happening, I believe, so maybe that's something worth considering, too.",2021-11-27 02:53:51

Kar27051,"d) tax implications
- Services like Lido/RocketPool give you tokens to represent your staked ETH. The US IRS counts this as exchanging your eth for that token, incurring capital gains based on the cost basis of your ETH.

c) lock up period
- till 2.0 if it's any of the staking options
- lending options like BlockFi/Celsius/etc. don't have lock up periods, but you also have to trust them and their lending practices
- crypto.com has lockup periods


b) not your keys not your crypto, but doing everything yourself can also be difficult depending on how tech savvy you are
- Coinbase/Kraken: large exchanges, one of the most convenient ways to stake, can lock your account with TOTP/hardware security keys (fido), they make money by staking crypto for you and taking a cut.

- Celsius/BlockFi: they lend your crypto out to make the money they pay you in interest. They claim most are fully collateralized (like MakerDAO CDPs), but they do make some un/under-colaterlized to ""institutuional investors"". The higher the interest rates go the more profit they have to squeeze out of their riskier lending.

- Staking services lido/rocketpool: they stake your ETH for you and you get a token that represents your holding. That token can be secured safely in any hardware wallet. 

- Staking services like Blox/Allnodes (32ETH): You have to secure your withdraw &amp;/ validator keys and any account info (Blox requires an AWS account). 

- Self hosting (32ETH): secure your withdraw &amp; validator keys, keep your node up to date, will require hardware or some cloud service. Harder to set up but there are guides out there.

a) constantly changing, just find the services you like most and compare current rates",2021-11-27 23:36:21

&gt; #DAI Con Argument
&gt; 
&gt; *Disclaimer: my stablecoin holdings are spread across DAI, UST and USDC. As I take more profit this year DAI will become a bigger holding, but for now it's less than 1% of my portfolio.*
&gt; 
&gt; - DAI is notable as a decentralized stablecoin. It basically [functions as a loan taken against ETH or other collateral](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/a-guide-to-makerdao-and-dai).
&gt; - In a [market full of centralized stablecoins](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/stablecoins) the appeal is clear: no need to trust a central authority (see [USDT Con arguments](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og1sms/rcryptocurrency_cointest_top_10_category_tether/)) or worry about [getting blacklisted](https://cryptobriefing.com/100000-usdc-blacklisted-highlighting-importance-decentralized-stablecoins/).
&gt; 
&gt; - That being said, nothing is risk free and there are some potential aspects of DAI to consider:
&gt; 
&gt; ##Backing
&gt; 
&gt; - As the name implies, 'multi-collateral' DAI is [backed by loans taken against multiple assets](https://share.streamlit.io/tadzz/maker_dai_collateralization_2/main/dai_collateral_app.py), not just ETH. I think a [multi-collateral model](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/#in-mcd-we-trust) helps to diversify risk instead of being backed by just one asset.
&gt; - But looking at the data you'll notice that a not insignificant amount of [DAI is generated from USDC](https://daistats.com/#/overview) and other centralized stablecoins. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [USDC was added to help stabilize DAI's peg back in March 2020](https://news.bitcoin.com/makerdao-devs-debate-usdc-dai-liquidity-issues/). I think this decision exposed DAI to some risk, given the non-zero possibility of issues with USDC/Circle, such as concerns about regulation, rehypothecation etc. (see [USDC Con arguments](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og2nfy/rcryptocurrency_cointest_top_10_category_usd_coin/)). Would DAI's peg/liquidity be impacted if the SEC came down on Circle tomorrow?
&gt; 
&gt; - Does this mean that DAI loses some decentralization street cred? No, [according to MakerDAO](
&gt; https://blog.makerdao.com/busting-makerdao-myths-seven-misconceptions-about-dai/). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, some community members saw it differently. One forum member voiced concerns at the time:
&gt; 
&gt;         &gt;""[there are new economical risk that can sneak in with such a solution and mixing it with an otherwise decentralized system ...

If it were, I would rather just want to stick with USDC altogether.](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/onboarding-usdc-as-collateral-to-mitigate-liquidity-risk/1570/16)""
&gt; 
&gt;     - So if you're a purist, you may not like DAI's 'contamination'.

&gt; 
&gt; - Anyway we know [decentralization is a spectrum](https://nopara73.medium.com/few-words-on-decentralization-and-anonymous-payments-160782d30b9e), not a binary distinction. And it's actually the political axis of decentralization which I find more concerning, which takes us to...
&gt; 
&gt; ##Monetary policy
&gt; 
&gt; - The rules that govern how DAI gets minted/collateralized and how it retains its $1 peg are sort of complicated for a lay user.
&gt;     - That's not a strong con in and of itself - most people interacting with smart contracts don't know how they work, you don't need to have a deep understanding of [how AMMs function](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/55m04x/lets_run_onchain_decentralized_exchanges_the_way/) to use a [DEX](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-decentralized-exchange-dex).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Still, I think a [seignorage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seigniorage.asp) system like [how Terra mints its decentralized stablecoin UST](https://research.thetie.io/the-terra-triforce-rise-of-the-lunatics/) is easier for folks to use and grasp - no need to [maintain a CDP](https://media.consensys.net/how-to-open-a-makerdao-cdp-and-earn-interest-on-compound-a-walkthrough-guide-b9e9f9584000), just burn LUNA to get UST. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Historically, DAI has fluctuated given market volatility and in the past the MakerDAO team have [debated different strategies to retain the $1 peg, including an 'emergency shutdown'](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/12/defi-leader-makerdao-weighs-emergency-shutdown-following-eth-price-drop/).
&gt; 
&gt; - The stability and collateralization of DAI is thus a function of MKR governance, which in my opinion has a lot of room for improvement:
&gt; 
&gt;     - There's a [lack of transparency](https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1197153771564019718) and a lack of participation, leading to [whales dictating monetary policy](https://twitter.com/0xMako/status/1188824097918029825?s=21). To take a more recent example, a [proposal to remove USDT collateral passed with only 10 unique voters, one of which had 73% of the voting power](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmRNwrTy?network=mainnet#vote-breakdown).
&gt; 
&gt; - To me this is not the ideal of decentralized governance, but more akin to the Federal Reserve setting monetary policy.

LongForWisdom,"As an aside. ETH-C is likely to be the cheapest and most long-term stable vault to borrow from. It does have a slightly higher liquidation ratio though.

As a minor unsolicited history lesson:

In the early days of single collateral DAI the Maker Foundation posted a few articles about how refinancing mortgages was a great use-case for the protocol because the stability fee was 0.5% at the time.

However, this backfired pretty badly when the stability fee was raised to maintain the DAI peg. Naturally those that had gone with that use-case were unhappy and presumably refinanced elsewhere when rates increased.

Maker Governance is obviously out of any one person's hands, but one of the goals the [MOMC](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/parameter-proposal-group-makerdao-open-market-committee/7355) (group that proposes monthly parameter changes), is that ETH-C supports the more long-term low-rate use-case for borrowing that had to be abandoned with single collateral DAI.",2021-11-29 21:27:33
YogurtclosetNo4072,"personally speaking I've been keeping my eye on Hubble Protocol. They are set to launch beginning of Jan, and something just feels different about them. its nice that a collateralized borrowing and lending protocol (built on Solana btw) will also carry a native token and a stablecoin for its users (they described themselves as the MakerDAO of Solana lol). 

more importantly Hubble preaches democratizing finance across all its users (pretty rudimental to the purpose of DeFi)--  the revenues they generate will be shared with the community that stakes HBB and deposits USDH into the stability pool that covers unhealthy loans, and a small percentage of this revenue is transferred to the protocol’s treasury.

Leza89,"&gt;Is it the lack of FDIC insurance,

You ONLY need this, if you do your business with centralized parties. You don't need insurance if you actually move into the Crypto space.

&gt;the constant pump and dumping of coins

Don't buy shitcoins. And if you tell me that Bitcoin is also pumping and dumping, then you should never go to the stock market or heck.. the gas station. Even Bluechips are manipulated.

&gt; the fact that exchanges are often criminal enterprises (Mt Gox, Bitfinex), the best US exchange locking its customers out routinely

Aaaaaand centralized exchanges have exactly what to do with Crypto? They could sell wheat, oil, hamsters or camels and the problems you're describing would be exactly the same. HOWEVER: Crypto creates Decentralized exchanges that do not suffer these problems.

&gt; the fact that Tether is admittedly backed by blank check chinese commercial paper

Tether just uses Blockchain technology. Tether is still centralized, as is Ripple, IOATA, Stellar Lumens and many, many other shitcoins. You can't compare decentralized projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Litecoin, ... with the likes of centralized shitshows.

Btw: there are even decentralized stablecoins, if you (rightfully) don't trust Tether; For example DAI (MakerDao).

&gt;the fact that whales own a larger percentage of the crypto pie as you

See above.. that is the 80/20 rule in action and could be, again, sad about wheat, oil, hamsters or camels.. (or dollars, for that matter)

&gt;or is it the maturity level of the youtubers shilling the next beanie babie coin with no perspective on historical asset bubbles that makes you trust in the crypto space so much?

You can lock your ETH into a smart contract with them, generate DAI as a loan and then you just pay back when you want+interest. You can ask this same question over there and/or check their website. 

We’re about to do home Reno and will likely do the same thing. Looking at HELOCs/regular loans/etc and makes the most sense to do it with Maker.

Edit: Forgot the best part, you don’t have to sell your ETH and it still gets to appreciate. If you ETH tanks to the leave where they liquidate you then they’ve sold your ETH for you and now you’re right back to doing what everyone else has recommended anyway.

DaddySkates,"# DAI: A Systematically Sustainable Stablecoin

&amp;#x200B;

Some who aren't yet familiar with the concept of stablecoins may ask themselves..what exactly that magical coin that is going up even in bear market?

Stablecoins are a group of cryptocurrencies where the price is pegged to (usually) a FIAT money such as dollar, yen, euro;  a cryptocurrency, or simply to exchange-traded commodities. These are cryptocurrencies that try to minimize the volatility in crypto market.  Stable coins provides us secure transactions, instant transfers without borders, low fees and quick settlements.

**What about DAI stablecoin?**

DAI is a stable coin that is issued by MakerDAO. It's an Ethereum-based protocol, which maintains an exact ratio of one-to-one with the USD. DAI as a stable coin is used for lending or borrowing crypto without any need for 3rd party making it a permissionless, transparent system with minimal restrictions.

**What makes DAI so special when we already have so many stablecoins?**

We have Tether, USDC, PAX, BUSD and others that are already providing all that stablecoins need.

DAI  keeps price in check with advanced smart contract system that is fully automated. If When price of DAI starts going too far from USD, Maker (abbrevated MKR) tokens are burned or created in order to stabilize the price of DAI.

The system manages the price of without the need of 3rd party which could pose as potential fraudulent activity on chain or simply middleman taking its cut. If the system works as intended and DAI keeps the constant value to US dollar, the holders of MAKER coins get benefits because the total supply of MKR is burned and through that the value increases with supply and demand.

**Can you just create DAI?**

Not as one would think. DAI isn't printed like FIAT in unlimited quantities but is instead created when a user takes a loan on Maker DAO. When that loan is paid the DAI is burned.

**That's all great and everything but surely it has some downsides right?**

Even though it's almost hard to be sceptical about it, there definitely are downsides to DAI

&amp;#x200B;

* Since it's rather advanced that can be a barrier which some people, mainly newcomers to crypto and DeFi aren't willing to overcome and they will simply choose the easiest and most user friendly option.
* Currently collateral in MakerDAO is rather limited.    Basic Attention Token (BAT), USDC, WBTC, TUSD, KNC, ZRX, MANA, ETH are the only one's available. Unless that list becomes far larger, it isn't the best option out there.
* Creating DAI vault is rather complicated and can pose a security risk.  In order to generate DAI one must transfer ownership of their assets to a smart contract that can sell your assets in the event of a market recession. It is a common practice among users to maintain a high collateral ratio to protect themselves from market risks and therefore liquidation, which makes this feel like leverage trading.
* A smart contract may be transparent and immutable, but lately there have been a lot of security holes unfamously the hack of DAO. Nothing is unhackable, at least not at present time.

A nice fact that not many know is that DAI actually ""started"" here on Reddit with eDollar.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ok, you convinced me but I need some TLDR PROs because I don't want to read this wall of text!**

Alright. To sum it up why DAI is one of the best stablecoins out there:

* \- The marketing from MakerDAO is starting to really get insane momentum and they are branding the DAI as the worlds first unbiased currency.
* \- DAI doesn't need real US dollar in order to back it. It works on completely different level and unlike Tether it's a much more reliable and secure way to run a stablecoin.
* \- DAI competitors USDT and USDC are controlled by the governing companies, which makes it hard to define such cryptocurrencies as decentralised. DAI is independent.
* \- You can't print DAI like you can print FIAT. Issuing DAI is governed by smart contracts which are immutable. Noone has ability to interfere with DAI.
* \- DAI isn't backed by FIAT but instead it's macked by cryptocurrency.
* \- Interaction between DAI and smartcontracts gives it a good support in DeFi. There are already over 400 DeFi apps that integrated DAI.
* \- Another very important point is that they have a really kickass logo

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And here is a really interesting fact for you... did you know is that DAI actually ""started"" here on Reddit with eDollar? Pretty cool huh?

FaceDeer,"I haven't actually used Tornado.cash myself, but I read up on it a while back and as I recall it's got some features that make this more difficult.

A Tornado pool has a pre-defined chunk size that all deposits and withdrawals must be equal to, so if for example you had 100 ETH you wanted to process and you were using a Tornado pool with 1 ETH chunk size you'd have to make 100 1-ETH deposits into it. Later you could make up to 100 1-ETH withdrawals. Everyone else using that pool would also be putting in and taking out 1-ETH amounts.

Tokens can be left sitting in a Tornado pool for as long as you want. If the hacker puts 100 ETH in, he can leave it in there for years as other people continue adding and removing Ether over that time. Or he could be withdrawing it piecemeal over that period. There's no way to tell.

And finally, Ether itself is completely fungible. So if the authorities try to enforce some kind of ""contamination"" rule where everything that comes out of a Tornado pool is considered tainted, you can fire off a couple of withdrawals from your pool into some big exchange's hot wallet and there'd be no way to distinguish it from the tens of thousands of ""legitimate"" Ether that's in there. Or trade your Ether for other currencies through a decentralized exchange, or turn it into DAI using MakerDAO, there's any number of ways to do permissionless conversions that will further spread the taint around and make the whole blockchain a hopeless jumble of blacklistings spreading like an unstoppable virus. Soon the only parts of the blockchain that continue to function at all will be the parts that don't participate in blacklistings like that.",2021-12-05 17:31:47

i_have_chosen_a_name,"When the Tether peg breaks (when, not if) it will undermine faith in all other stablecoins. The last stable coin standing will be DAI, but if the underlaying assets that back DAI decrease fast enough the MAKERDAO guys can vote (this vote will be extremely expensinve in terms of gas fees cause everybody is panicing making tx after tx) and hit the emergency button.

So DAI, it's peg might break but will also be the first to bounce back.

However every single stablecoin that does not have a mechanism that depends on math vs humans will lose it's peg.

These stablecoins have been 1 dollar because people believe they are one dollar. That faith will soon be gone and every stablecoin will have a peg break.

There are two type of stablecoin companies

- those that are willing to pay with their own money to keep their peg stable

- those that are not willing to pay with their own money to keep their peg stable.

And then there is a third category:

those that never had any money to begin with.

xBacked_io,"Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs). The system is backed by **more** assets than debt, helping to maintain the peg. This is known as ""over collateralized"" vs ""under collateralized"". Under collateralized systems in crypto are **hard** due to identifying trustworthy actors. [Maple Finance](https://www.maple.finance/) is tackling this problem.

As for the use case of a decentralized stablecoin, platforms like xBacked or MakerDAO allow people to lock their collateral (e.g Algo) and mint a stablecoin to then go and get yield elsewhere in an ecosystem. For example, instead of selling Algo for USDC to invest in a new project, you could mint xUSD and invest using that instead. The other part of it is that, as others have mentioned, how do you know there is $1 backing 1 USDT? At least in open, decentralized protocols like xBacked, everything is transparent and 100% backed.

For the xBacked protocol specifically, you will be able to stake xUSD to participate in liquidations and receive Algo from liquidated vaults.",2021-12-06 05:57:55

Revanchist1,"**The Curve Wars**


**The Battle For High TVL**

DeFi protocols live and die by their Total Value Locked (TVL). The first great war for TVL was the battle of Uniswap and Sushiswap. DeFi summer saw the a plethora of DeFi protocols being launched.  When ChefNomi forked Uniswap to create Sushiswap - they had to incentivize users to deposit their funds on a new platform. After all, an AMM with low TVL will be inefficient for large volume traders trying to swap between coins without high slippage. Sushiswap - which aimed to be a community governed Automatic Market Maker - first incentivized users to stake LP positions from Uniswap on the platform to earn Sushi Tokens. This was done via Liquidity Mining. First used by IDEX (2017) in a very primitive form, then refined in DeFi summer with Synthetix and Compound (2020). After Sushiswap gained enough liquidity, history was made. This was the first time in DeFi History (and in finance history) where a vampire attack was carried to such a large degree. In the space of a week **$1 Billion** was siphoned from Uniswap and into SushiSwap. The Uniswap team could do nothing but watch as Sushiswap took users, liquidity, and trading volume away from their platform. This inevitably led to Uniswap launching their own governance token - UNI.

**Rules Of The Game**

Players in DeFi win by attracting liquidity via offering better yields for users

**Stability In The Curve**

Curve is an AMM for Stablecoins and helps maintain the 1:1 Peg. It is a major building block underpinning all of DeFi. 

*Side note: Curve v2 is aiming to compete with Uniswap and other AMMs.* 

Launched on August 13, 2020 - Curve incentives users depositing stablecoins via liquidity mining of CRV tokens. 

**CRV** can be locked to received **vote escrowed Curve** **(veCRV)** tokens.

veCRV is used to vote in the CurveDAO in return they get boosted rewards from LPing into pools, trading fees from pools, and other things. The important one is having a say in the gauge weight - or how much of the newly minted CRV is distributed to each pool.

Because of how important Curve is to the ecosystem, owning Curve is extremely important for DAOs. 



Curve Docs - 
https://resources.curve.fi/

**Key takeaway: Owning veCRV boosts your yield.**

If a new project is launching a stablecoin, having a say where Curve rewards go will help bootstrap your projects TVL/Liquidity.


**Yearn and the Andre's Foresight**

Yearn Finance was an early user of CRV and player in the Curve War. Yearn launched the backscratcher vault in November of 2020 - a one way vault allowing users to lock curve in exchange for yearn vote escrowed Curve (**yveCRV**). yveCRV gave better yields for users compared to the the regular veCRV so it naturally began accumulating a higher value of locked CRV tokens.


Yearn would then use the veCRV gained to vote in the CurveDAO to boost the incentives given to Yearn's Pools. A positive feedback loop giving Yearn better incentives for users and more Curve tokens.**The Yearn Backscrather vault resulted in a higher TVL**


**In Comes Convex**

As always read the docs for better understanding:

https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/why-convex

Convex allows users to receive the boosted rewards of staking in Curve without locking up/owning any CRV tokens. It accumuklated so much CRV that it overtook Yearns position in just 14 days.

Convex also allows users to instead stake their CRV tokens and recieve a liquid version of veCRV - the Convex Curve Token (**cvxCRV**). 

Since Convex is also a DAO, they also have a voting locked token, vote locked Convex (**vlCVX**) which allows holders to dictate which way the DAO uses its veCRV to vote.


**Bribing**

August of 2021 - After seeing how successful curve rewards were for getting liquidity, Andre Cronje released a platform to bribe veCRV holders to vote certain ways. For example, veCRV owners who vote for Abracadabra will receive a bonus paid out in Spell.

But it gets deeper.

Similar to Bribes, Convex has Votium.

Votium Docs - 
https://docs.votium.app/

Which allows Governance Tokens/DAOs to bribe vlCVX holders to vote a certain way.


**How It Works In Practice**

Look no further than Frax and their fractional-algorithmic stablecoin pools and Abracadabra's MIM. Without increasing their budgets they were able to increase their liquidity compared to the simple direct liquidity mining incentives.


https://twitter.com/crypto_condom/status/1463589085486923778?s=20

&gt;fraxfinance has allocated $839M to the $CRV ecosystem. 
The $2m bribe $FRAX paid to Votium gets paid to voters who vote for their pool. Since FRAX uses their own vlCVX to vote for the FRAX pool, they earn their bribe back + $5 of CRV/CVX rewards for every $1 of bribe spent.



*Sidenote:[ MakerDao has actually started implementing certain aspects of Frax for DAI.](https://twitter.com/samkazemian/status/1455616788050296833?s=20)* It's interesting to see how the builders of DeFi work together to create a better ecosystem. 

**Future of The Curve Wars**

It's not really a Curve War anymore. Yearn and its competitor, StakeDAO, have since conceded to Convex. Yearn recently began delegating its veCRV to convex to achieve higher yields.

However since the DeFi 2.0 system has emerged this year. Tokemak uses a similar mechanism to Curve. Owners of Tokemak token are able to direct liquidity to different pools. 

TOKE may play a big part in getting Liquidity for new Tokens.

[Here is an interesting post from the Tokemak Team regarding the future of DAOs](https://medium.com/tokemak/the-evolution-of-daos-1692509bbb41)


The Idea of ""Protocol Owned Liquidity"" is a massive leap forward in Dao Tokenomics and was pioneered by OlympusDAO. They have already entered the Curve War battlefield by accepting CVX in exchange for OHM Bonds and are launching a new Branch - Redacted Cartel - in order to get a larger CRV ownership.

[A podcast with 0xSami concerning a new branch of OlympusDao - RedactedCartel.](https://rss.com/podcasts/agorapod/333233/)



**Value of Liquidity Directing Tokens**

CRV, CVX, and TOKE, are all important in the DeFi ecosystem. It's obvious that DAOs owning these tokens will be important in the future. And DeFi 2.0, for the most part, seems to be concerned with the interactions between DAOs as opposed to regular folks. 

I just thought it would be interesting to give a little post about the developments of **The Curve War** and who the future players may be.",2021-12-06 06:43:58

MinimalGravitas,"&gt; They would have to control the majority of the staking power (nearly impossible)

No it's really not 'nearly impossible'. I don't know how much Algorand is staked, but let's assume all of it, with ALGO's current marketcap of about $10 billion you would need roughly $5 billion to have a majority control. For context there are single dApps on Ethereum that could achieve that. MakerDAO has a total locked value of almost $20 billion, but even more ridiculously UniSwap has a treasury of $7.2 billion, meaning that someone could raise a proposal to take over Algorand and the UniSwap governance community would theoreticallt have enough money to do so without even emptying their reserves.

Obviously if less than 100% of ALGO is staked then the theoretical cost to attack is proportionally lower.

I'm not saying I think that's likely to happen, I don't see any reason why an Ethereum dApp's community would bother attacking Algorand, but my point is that it's not enough to just assume no one will attack you.",2021-12-08 07:04:28

I find the idea quite interesting to bring so stronger dUSD to USD.
But I'm also a fan of looking at what other projects have already done to solve a similar problem.

What I would be interested in now is how are other projects doing with decentralized stable coins like DAI? I have read briefly into the whitepaper at MakerDAO.

do you know MakerDao and Dai? They also offering decentralized loans via a Vault and a own decentralized stable coin. Sure MakerDao is based on the Ethereum blockchain but maybe the working mechanism are adoptable for DeFiChain?

I guess the Vault mechanism is not so unique. Maybe more or less unique on non Ethereum or BSC.

Why do you think the price for stock tokens is per design much higher than the oracle prices? I guess the demand for dTokens is just to high and less people are willing to mint new dTokens especially dUSD because of the the risk not the get enough dUSD back for a fair price to close there loans.

Could you please explain why do you think, an more or less inflationary dUSD won't also solve the high prices of dTokens?

Kind regards 👍",2021-12-12 14:14:51
uzyn,"You are right. The lag is going to present at most early decentralized token systems. See the early crazy days of DAI/MakerDAO.

Their early days problems are that DAI were traded below $1. The early days of MakerDAO started with very low interest rates, and kept raising it a few times to no avail, until the DAO proposed a really drastic move that significantly inflate the interest rates that it would start to push DAI up to $1.

There's however a slight difference of this vs DeFiChain currently. Collateral for DAI back then was merely ETH, which has no opportunity cost – no liquidity mining with high returns, no staking. 

DeFiChain's DFI though has a massive opportunity cost to let it sit in a vault. Users who mint dTokens with DFI are losing out a massive LM/staking opportunity cost. The action right now is very evident on that – DUSD is traded higher than $1.

DeFiChain's situation is the other way round, the lost opportunity cost needs to be compensated.

====

On lag, yes this is true. Any DAO-based systems would be lagging behind market condition. It is however still workable. As on the pinkpaper, the ultimate goal is to move this entirely to consensus to have auto feedback, thereby eliminating the lag.",2021-12-13 01:40:12

Agree. 

I'm mostly holding out hope that I and everyone else are wrong and some super genious will invent some novel way to make it work. Its completely a pipe dream but would be insanely cool. 

&gt;""Overcollateralised decentralised stablecoins"" will work, the main issue is that unlike banks, these entities can only hold crypto assets. So they will always inherently be at more systemic risk than dollar denominated normal banks.

MakerDAO (that emits Dai) actually already is partly collateralised with regular bonds and other traditional financial instruments.

In traditional banking, there are regulations on how much a bank needs to hold in reserve dollars - this regulation is NOT 100% matching reserves still, but there is a legal requirement.

The reason for this is because when there is a run on the bank, if they don't have enough reserve dollars, they can't pay out withdrawals, which exacerbates a crisis.

But if Tether runs out of reserve dollars to back their stablecoin, that doesn't mean people are unable to get their money back. It only means Tether loses its dollar peg. That's still a bad thing, but it's something that happens regularly to other stablecoins like DAI and nobody whines about MakerDAO reinventing the federal reserve.",2021-12-15 03:14:29

Both of these options are still better then multisig layer2s with 0 validators im sorry there realy is no argument for this everyone knows layer l2s are ridiculously centralised

Did you just dodge the fact anyone can freely compete? With all the consequences it has on the ecosystem? You seem to have a hard time understanding the meaning and consequences of free competition. Need any help, maybe? 

""Solana has 1300 profitable validators and that list is growing daily.. the amount of solana a validator needs staked to break even is dropping daily and many of the nft daos are now popping up as sucessfull non funded validators""

And you dodged the fact they're funded by the company money rather than by the network itself. Why didn't you answer about that? To be more accurate, it's for way more than 90% of their rewards. As I said, they're rewarded by the company itself and can't profitably participate into the network without these funds. Finite funds. Which means it's unsustainable.

""Wouldn't take much for bsc to add a few more validators either and may be in there future to further decentralise""

It's a permissioned chain, adding a few more validators won't magically change the status of the chain. That's ridiculous, now. Stop shaming yourself, please, you're showing too much you don't understand anything you're saying.

""And no even bsc with 21 validators is still orders of magnitudes better then a ""bank"" as you put it but even then a banks shareholders votes are more evenly distributed then your so called layer 2 daos lmfao""

Hum... no, it's literally the same thing as a bank. It's currently less regulated, but only because states don't yet want to get onto this too harshly. It's a centralized company running a chain. The second a state wants to coerce it, it gets coerced. Just like a bank. Or maybe you're meaning Binance offer more profitable deals? If so, yeah, I agree, it's the principle behind any new competitor trying to get market shares: they need to compete by offering better deals. But the market will settle down and find a middle ground, with each competitor finding its spot. 

Really, you should probably read more, because you are shaming yourself non stop in public, here. It's quite unhealthy.",2021-12-15 18:57:48
plurBUDDHA,"Sorry for getting back to you a bit later but nxte gave some quality answers and I will just be adding onto what they said.

1) So yeah at first it can be perceived as annoying or inconvenient, the main thing that needs to be communicated with new users is that these are deposits and at no time do you lose those tokens. The only time it really becomes an issue is if you needed to spend a few CKB but that put you under the 62 limit and therefore requires you to remove your cell from the network. I am not sure if DOT has this cost as a deposit or a real cost but CKB it will always be a deposit, so you never actually lose those coins. So there is nothing stopping a user currently from having to deposit a large amount of money should the price hit $1, the goal of the network is also to push devs to innovate ways so things cost less as time goes on. Someone may figure out a way to write a cell script that costs 5ckb it just simply has not happened yet.

2) 1 CKBytes = 100,000,000 Shannons and a basic 2 input 2 output transaction costs .00000464 shannons iirc. So transaction fees wont even cost $1 until Nervos is $10,000. The fees will be even lower on L2 and yes Crypto .com overcharges by a lot.

3) Nxte already gave a complete answer anything else I would refer you to the NexiDAO page to read more about TAI. The only thing I can add is that Nexis is a copy of MakerDAO so it functions almost identically.

4) I agree with nxte NFT's should be able to be ""destroyed"" to recieve the deposit back. I use quotations because I do not think the artwork itself gets destroyed but the cell used to hold the artwork on the network is removed. The artwork should be like a simple .jpg file and its data stored in the cell on the Common Knowledge base. Also as nxte pointed out L2 will become the common holding place for data as the network utilizes Godwoken more. So a lot of the deposits that we currently see will either be largely reduced on L2 or become non-existent. 

As the network develops and matures we should see L1 as more of a safehaven for data rather than the main storage layer. I think the best analogy is the Common Knowledge Base (CKB) will become a large library of scripts, both private and public. Wallets with large holdings will be safely secured in cells on L1, also things like NFT's may take up some space. L2 will be used for the majority of the networks functionality though so many of the risks with deposit costs will be minimalized as L2 becomes more commonplace for network activity.",2021-12-16 03:46:50

Martin1209,"Guilty - I've been into crypto far longer than I have been into silver, as I see the same appeal for both as a scarce commodity!

&gt;I only would bring apes to a discussion how such system could look like…and how we minimize some issues of crypto…..it could also be a new system (from apes for apes)

Agreed, I definitely see a use for it in collateralised lending on chain, the premise is already set of course, but there would be benefits to bringing it on chain assuming it is done properly.

&gt;One of my ideas would be to digitalize physical silver by QR Codes on every coin or bar

I worry that this would not 'bring it on chain' as such, and that the actual solution would be not much of a step ahead of what currently exists, ie audited vaults, just they would write this to a particular chain and be associated with a particular token as opposed to the existing auditing process. Counterparty risk is always an issue with such things, like we've seen with the current system where there are multiple owners for the same piece of silver, there would be nothing to stop this happening with a crypto token if not sufficiently audited. 

It is happening though as you say, and it is a step in the right direction/some would say inevitable. It would have to be done within a strict framework to ensure the current system isn't just replicated 'on chain'. See below from MakerDAO who are onboarding real world assets but bear in mind the caution of this approach, and this whole process has been ongoing for years with relatively little 'locked value' to show so far.

Another metric would be TVL (total value locked). Many smart contracts require assets to be 'locked' in to them in order to use them. An example would be a contract where you lend assets to someone else. The assets you lend would be 'locked' into the contract. Think of it as assets under management.

Well, no. DAI is the 4th largest stable and it's controlled by MakerDAO, backed mostly by ETH though admittedly it's too reliant on USDC as backing right now (but improving). Then there are about a million other DAO-based stables that aren't reliant on a central authority. MIM is one of my favorites right now. 

There are even stables that aren't pegged to any fiat currency like RAI so they're 100% decentralized.

Maybe consider hyper-collateralization? Can’t do it yet, but could make you crazy amounts of passive income. Good luck!

MerkleChainsaw,"Nobody knows where Ethereum's market cap will top out, but generally market caps for cryptocurrencies and equities are incomparable.

Mastercard stock, for example, is worth the present value of future profit that Mastercard is expected to make, which is considerably less than the value of Mastercard's network. To see this, imagine that Mastercard permanently changed to a non-profit organization run by the ""Mastercard Foundation"" and charged fees to break even over time. It's stock would be worthless but the network itself would be even more valuable than it is today.

Or to think of it another way, imagine crypto was like the oil industry. ETH's market cap would be more like the earth's oil stock (worth over $100 trillion) and it would be inappropriate to compare it to the value of the earth's oil companies (with less than 3 trillion market cap).

There are some exceptions to this. For example MakerDAO generates earnings which accrue to the MKR token, so you can calculate a P/E ratio and compare it to equities.",2021-12-21 00:57:45

Sylv__,"Les stablecoins, c'est très large ! Si je devais résumer avec ma connaissance (mais en cherchant ""stablecoin types"" on trouve beaucoup de détails), on a :
1. Les stablecoins émis par une entreprise (centralisé), supposément backé par exemple par USD, EUR, de l'or, etc. Ce sont par exemple USDT (émis par Tether), USDC (émis par Circle), BUSD et USDP (émis par Paxos). Parmi les stablecoins centralisés, certains sont plus transparents que d'autres.
2. Les stablecoins dits algorithmiques, backés par ""du vent"". Je connais mal le sujet, mais c'est je pense le cas d'UST qui est backé par LUNA. Ici, il n'y a pas de collatéral en jeu. Mais je connais mal donc je ne vais pas m'étendre.
3. Les stablecoins avec collatéral crypto, on retrouve par exemple DAI ou LUSD. Ici, le risque est moins de faire confiance à une entité tiers (Tether, Circle...), mais plutôt d'être confiant que les smart contracts sont fiables, et que le collatéral est sain. Par exemple, MakerDAO (émetteur de DAI) accepte l'USDC et le WBTC en collatéral pour l'émission de DAI, qui sont des tokens centralisés et de facto sujets à régulation. Liquity (émetteur de LUSD) n'accepte que ETH comme collatéral, est n'est donc pas directement sensible à des décisions du législateur.

Tout ça pour dire, quand on parle de stablecoin, c'est très large. Le fait que je veuille sortir d'USDT ne veut pas du tout dire que je veux sortir des stablecoins, au contraire je pense que certains d'entre eux sont un excellent hedge contre une chute du marché !",2021-12-21 21:48:02

a_stonk_a_day,"Compreendo que sejas conservador como tal esta sugestão é focada nisso mesmo e não uma sugestão aleatória: cripto, nomeadamente stablecoins, moedas que seguem o valor do dólar e que removem o factor volatilidade que é habitualmente o maior entrave à utilização de crypto para quem não se move nesse mundo.

Juros de 5-10% ao ano em soluções de centralized finance (CeFi) como Nexo ou Celsius, para depósitos de stables como USDC e BUSD, ambas moedas emitidas por organizações centralizadas e com histórico de cooperação com os reguladores.

Juros de 10-20% ao ano em soluções de finanças descentralizadas (DeFi) como Curve, MakerDAO e Anchor Protocol, para depósitos de stablecoins completamente descentralizadas (Ex.: UST, DAI)  que também não são emitidas por entidades centrais como as mencionadas anteriormente. O nível de conhecimento para esta estratégia é um pouco mais elevado mas os retornos e a segurança também o são.  


E parabéns pelo percurso que fizeste até aqui. Boa sorte para a próxima etapa da vida que é fazer com que esse dinheiro não só não encolha, mas que cresça.

Chapo_Rouge,"Well, I have been in DeFi for some time I guess.  


USDT is kind of the black duck, backing of USDT has been discussed at lenth, it does seems backed 1:1 by dollars, maybe by other means but this carries risk.  


DAI carries smart contract risk from MakerDAO and USDC risk. That said, it's very established by now as a good stablecoin.  


USDC carries risk from its centralized issuers (Circle/Coinbase) meaning your USDC can in theory be frozen by Circle",2021-12-24 01:07:56
ironmagnesiumzinc,"What do you mean by ""Even though MakerDao claimed their code is open source, it is not accessible to the public. Their portfolio-backed assets are intransparent""? Can you elaborate, because I thought both of these were public. [https://makerburn.com/#/rundown](https://makerburn.com/#/rundown) https://github.com/orgs/makerdao/repositories",2021-12-24 01:14:44
steadyhandhide,"One regret was selling a bunch of random alts into BTC sometime in early 2021. I really don’t care about those projects, but in hindsight it would have been wiser to wait  longer than I did. My philosophy late 2020 was to buy random small lots of alts, e.g. Loopring, Chainlink, MakerDAO, Tezos, Compound, Uniswap, etc. in preparation for “alt season”. Some were dogs and still haven’t really done much, but others were doing pretty good when I sold them, and then proper exploded after I sold. 

Nothing wrong with putting some money in your pocket while looking for the next opportunity. Crypto does offer some crazy gains during a bull run, but there are thousands of other markets out there where someone can make money with some planning and discipline. Do not think that this was (or is) your “one shot” at living a decent life. That mindset is toxic. It prevents you from finding more practical ways of earning money and pushes you into high risk/low reward situations at the worst of times.

Good luck.",2021-12-24 03:04:49

Summum,"I try to have my fundamental positions in protocols that have high value capture without additional friction. I avoid protocols that are reliant on fees to be worth something. Theses will get forked and lose steam over time. Eg MakerDao vs Abracadabra/Spell.

Eg.

\- All layer 1 chains except some Cosmos chains seem to capture a lot of value from the token utility.

\- Tokens wich have high value accrual from their utility in the protocol. $luna burn &amp; mint mechanism, $rune use as bond security VS TVL

\- I think It's very likely that we will see a web3 game become a 100bn ecosystem, investing early in the good spots might bring massive returns.",2021-12-26 11:36:12

jawni,"I'm talking about MakerDAO (DAI) specifically but this could apply to any over-collaterallized lending protocol.

Bear market driving down the collateral value and driving up the price of DAI is what has caused the biggest liquidation events.

Page 9 and 10 of this report actually cover this quite extensively: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06389.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06389.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We find that all of the  
four lending platforms are sensitive to the price decline of ETH. For  
example, an immediate 43% decline of the ETH price (analogous to  
the ETH price decline on the 13th of March, 2020), would result in  
up to 1.07B USD collateral to become liquidatable on MakerDAO.  
To our surprise, although Aave V2 and Compound follow similar  
liquidation mechanisms and have similar TVL, Aave V2 is more  
stable to price declines in terms of liquidatable collateral. By manually inspecting, we find that this is because Aave V2 users prefer  
adopting a multiple-cryptocurreny collateral. Hence, the positions  
in Aave V2 are less likely to become liquidatable due to the price  
decline of a single cryptocurrency.",2021-12-27 01:54:55

nikola_j,"&gt;Defi will be back - but it will need a perfect storm

I believe you're only talking about DeFi tokens here, right? Because I haven't seen DeFi as a space slowing down in any way, it's just that the tokens are down bad. And I guess they'll recover at some point, though I also see the problem in most DeFi tokens being governance voting tokens with no other mechanisms or use cases.

&gt;\- We need one roll up with all dapps that are right now on ETH mainnet --&gt; one composable roll up that allows you to use all the applications you know. Right now, there are too many apps missing because they are spread over the different execution layers. 

This would be great, though not sure if it'll happen in the next year. L2s are just starting to compete for users, so don't think it's likely that we see a clear winner as soon as 2022, especially given that they all have a lot of development to handle first (e.g. Arbitrum and Optimism are still throttled afaik, while zk-rollups have just started with generalized dapps support).

&gt;I guess Maker / DAI issuance is also a must have, I think there was news/ rumours about AAVE also issuing DAI, if that happens, it could work as well, but I guess you get my point. Lending/ borrowing + yield farming / liquidity mining

Just adding info on your Maker and Aave points:

Aave wants to have Aave v3 on all the chains and they have a ""wormhole"" feature built into v3, that allows users moving positions between chains seamlessly. This will effectively enable quick wormholing for DAI, too. Though there are a number of other quick-bridging protocols that are picking up steam, too (e.g. Celer, Hop).

MakerDAO itself already has an [official Dai bridge to Arbitrum](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/official-dai-token-bridge-now-live-on-arbitrum-one/10438/11), for example. Moreover, they plan to introduce actual Maker Vaults and Dai minting on L2s in Q1 or Q2 from what I know.

&gt;Liquidity mining could also be sparked by RU-tokens. I guess we will need incentives to kick start liquidity on the different RU and of course a mix of application tokens and RU tokens would be huge.

I'm not personally sold on L2s having tokens, but I guess we'll see, not saying it's not likely or anything like that. Incentives are definitely needed in either case, especially given how much alternative L1s are pouring out in order to get users. And it may actually be the case we see a new round of [$UNI incentives](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xe377d2b8e245404c42a6892be4232e017bf44b7fcc2e72426aa95ea5a4e01783) as a big catalyst.

Maswasnos,"&gt; If a bunch of people start buying erc20 usdc, it won't. Why? Stablecoin has a special treatment on exchange??

A concept called arbitrage keeps stablecoin values in check. Theoretically, you can always redeem a stablecoin for $1 of value either in USD (USDC, USDT) or in crypto (DAI, LUSD, MIM). 

Because of this, it incentivizes arbitrage between large exchanges and the entities issuing stablecoins. Arbitrage is basically this:

1. Lots of people sell DAI on Coinbase for some other asset, and the price drops a bit because of supply/demand
2. A whale notices DAI is only $.995 on Coinbase and buys up a few million dollars-worth, bringing the price back to $1
3. That whale then takes the DAI back to MakerDAO and redeems it for slightly more crypto than he paid to acquire the DAI on coinbase, more than covering the transaction fees

The same applies in reverse when the price is over $1.

1. Lots of people buy DAI on an exchange, and the price goes to $1.01
2. A whale uses a ton of crypto to mint a few million DAI at MakerDAO
3. The whale takes his fresh DAI to that exchange and sells it all at $1.01, driving the price back down

Obviously you need a ton of money to make this worthwhile, but if you did this with $10million on a 1-cent difference, you'd get about $100k in one round of arbitrage. Then you automate this process with a bot and you make absurd sums of money. Repeat for every stablecoin out there and every exchange with decent volume.",2021-12-29 01:02:07

takethewealth,"Doesn't really make sense to look for advice from people who don't understand crypto.  Don't listen to friends who think crypto is a ponzi and who haven't made millions from crypto like you have.  They should be taking advice from you.  

 Also no one can tell you what's right for you.  Yoire I'm Canada so not sure if this applies, but in the US, if you borrow against your assets, thats not a taxable event.  That's one of the big ways the rich get rich, they borrow against they're appreciating assets without selling them and being able to use those borrowed funds for their life or other investments. Thats why real estate is very popular and a lot of very wealthy people created their wealth through RE.

 I'm not sure what digital assets you have, but you can use something like makerdao or liquity, or rari to put up your assets as collateral and borrow against them without realizing a taxable event.  This is assuming you're using the ethereum network and you understand how to use smart contracts/different protocols.

eastsideski,"Agreed, I was fascinated learning about the formal verification process that MakerDAO underwent a couple years ago.

There's plenty of sketchy projects and rugpulls in DeFi, but there's also tons of projects that are moving very carefully.",2021-12-29 23:48:32
dredaniel,"Ich führe es etwas aus, weil ich gerade in Reddit-Laune bin ...

* **Permissionless:**  Jeder kann partizipieren. Es gibt keine Sanktionen gegen bestimmte Länder (siehe US&lt;-&gt;Iran) oder Ethnien. 
* **Open:** Als Entwickler kann ich selbst meine Bank programmieren und andere Entwickler haben offene Schnittstellen zu dieser Bank. So ist die Bank (siehe MakerDao, Yearn) als solches nur ein fundamentales Baustück auf das andere mit neuen Utilities (z.B. Lending/Borrowing a la Aave, Compound) aufbauen können. Nun ersetze ""Bank"" mit anderen Domänen wie Versicherung oder Logistik und du bekommst offene Zensure-Resistente Netzwerke mit Utilities.
* **Dezentral:** Hier gibt es viele Vorteile. Unter anderem: 
   * Es gibt keine Zensur. Man kann es höchstens mit viel Aufwand auf Staatenebene verbieten. Ob das Erfolg hat für das jeweilige Land wenn sich Blockchains durchsetzen bleibt fraglich. Man stelle sich die Frage was mit Ländern passierte die das Internet blockiert haben.
   * Transaktionen auf der Blockchain sind resistent gegen Korruption.
   * Eine zentrales Unternehmen (z.B. Facebook) hat keine Kontrolle über mich als Individuum.  


Die Bullshit-Bingo Wörter sind auch nur 3 von vielen wichtige Eigenschaften mMn (welche nicht von allen Blockchains eingehalten werden (siehe SOL !== dezentral)).",2021-12-30 02:31:27

jankis2020,"Thank you! I’m going to look into Aave. Is it WBTC that I would be using? I tried MakerDao and Compound and basically was getting eaten alive on fees, which made it pointless, unless I was pulling thousands of bucks, it seemed. I also was a little spooked by the liquidation event MakerDao had when BTC crashed in March. Losing money to unexpected code functionality is as bad as a Mt Gox situation, really. But truthfully, I’m such a conservative guy, I’m not gonna borrrow without the collateral to cover an 80% market downturn, I know myself. So I don’t think a quick crash like that would get me. 

Thank you for the tips! I’m gonna continue exploring it.",2021-02-01 02:19:54
scheistermeister,"Argent? Monolith? Compound? Dharma? Aave? MakerDAO (ok DAI is there, but maker is more than just DAI) I think quite a few more might be missing.

troyboltonislife,"You can still democratize risk while still sheltering individual users from it. I was talking about Daos. Look into MakerDao and how they handle democratizing risk. The Tl;dr of it is there are investors who own a stake in the organization and profit off of the organizations activities (minting stablecoin) however if their activities were to fail(stablecoin peg fails), the investors are the ones who would pay the price. 

It is less abstracted then how investing in brokerages work and allow individuals to directly profit off of taking on risk. A dao is also much more democratic and allows stakeholders to directly vote on proposals. 

I think the issue is best fixed by following MakerDao’s footsteps with a two-prong approach. First, a distributed ledger system designed in a way to prevent transaction failure risk. This should be enough to reduce the majority of the risk that brokerages currently bear and handle as the system can be automated with set protocols that react based on how the system or market is working and are designed in a way to react correctly. This can all be done with code and the rules/protocols will be known by all users or participants. And second, a last resort panic button by forcing stakeholders to finance any issues a failure in the system causes. 

These legacy systems are dated and the biggest reason for their existence was the need to use systems that were trusted and secure. Brokerages exist because they can be trusted by people through government enforcement. However, blockchain has solved the trust issue and we don’t need to trust an entity backed by the government anymore. We can trust systems to work as intended using just good old mathematics, game theory and code.",2021-02-01 10:41:14
anor_wondo,"I agree with you on that. There is no point in a centralised blockchain apart from very fringe use cases.

But have you not really been paying attention to the space. Ethereum based smart contracts had a massive growth. We have behemoth platforms like Aave, Yearn, MakerDAO, Uniswap, Nexus mutual now.

There would be no use of any significant innovation in blockchain unless it's being used as a public network. Many have tried a cbdc on private central bank network and already failed. It's really stupid",2021-02-01 15:21:54
RisenSteam,"&gt; But have you not really been paying attention to the space.

Yes, I haven't. I spent a couple of months understanding blockchains technically 3-4 years back &amp; trying to figure out non-currency uses  (as a part of a work assignment) &amp; then decided it's mostly useless outside of cryptocurrency use. Smart Contracts were the only thing I found mildly different from all other use-cases &amp; even there I wasn't fully convinced.  

&gt; We have behemoth platforms like Aave, Yearn, MakerDAO, Uniswap, Nexus mutual now.

One question - are any of these making money or saving money for someone? If not, then they will shutdown once VC money dries off.   


There have been blockchain platforms for a lot of things over the last many years. Lots of pilots were started - for e.g. various banks around the world including ICICI in India piloted blockchain based money transfer, then there were logistics platforms which were supposed to take off. But did any of them take off?",2021-02-01 15:33:24
franzperdido,"Yes, that's what we would call a leveraged position. But bear in mind, every iteration you will decrease the amount of stable coins you get because you need to be over colleteralized by at least 150 % (using MakerDao). Realistically &gt; 300% would be appropriate, otherwise, yeah, as you put it, ""dust"".",2021-02-01 15:52:33
RisenSteam,"&gt; Yes. Aave is a lending/borrowing platform, it has been granted license as an electronic money institution in uk. MakerDAO allows for collateralized minting of DAI, a stable coin. Yearn algorithmically uses all these platforms(and others) to lend your stablecoins at the most optimal interest rates.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Currently the interest rates in DEFI have been much better than any developed country and most developing countries. All of these while cutting out the middleman using smart contracts and ethereum blockchain to secure the network

Which of these companies is making money or saving money? Is there a source that they are? 

AFAIK, all these are still running on Venture Capital.   

&gt; Mastercard and Visa are in the works to integrate public blockchains, paypal has also got a roadmap for direct payments(currently it only allows buying crypto)

These things have been happening for many years. But nothing takes off. Like I said many banks did pilots for money transfer many years back. But what is the point? What exactly is the application which Visa or Master is going to run on the blockchain. If it's payment processing, how is it better than or more secure than the 3DSecure protocol used by VISA &amp; Master currently for payment processing?   

Like before, I think it's all mostly FOMO stuff.",2021-02-01 15:53:25
DefiOpt,"I shared my opinion last couple Of days Ago about EOS. The EOS is the real and safe asset in the crypto world and never reflects total value during the development time. Now is the time to expose real deal, which is proof, faster and free blockchain, and fit for highly scalable applications that need less transaction time in second. Eth is failed, and all people on eth are now suffering high gas fees, most of. People. Even they can not get they profit from the pool because too high gas fee sucking all profit.
I love Defibox i enjoy having eos and also generate true income and also no gas fee!
You can do all uniswap + makerDao + Aave in one app, no cost and cheaper than Eth. So if you still defending to me Eth better to play , my friend you are on wrong mind set. If something is sucking money from your pocket that’s mean of you are on wrong side. 
I’m not saying eos best but in-terms of what describe for income generation  , eos is the best place for now until conditions  change.

Neophyte-,"as another poster said, defi pulse, you can loan out stablecoins or borrow. there is also makerdao where you can mint dai from crypto. dexes like uniswap too.",2021-02-02 02:28:09
on_roft,"That's a lot of questions. Basically, I think to be on board with blockchain (and not just in it for the pump) you need to accept the paradigm under which it is bette. Blockchain isn't like other tech and I'm sick of hearing about how it's not fast or easy or cheap enough to attract the mainstream. It's still a weird and anarchist playground, even though more stable institutions are popping up at the frontier. In the new paradigm, more decentralized, permissionless and laissez-faire is more important than more accessible, cheap, fast and protected by regulators. There is no competing with classical computing as it stands. The world computer, and the world currencies, are doomed to be either very slow and expensive, or just to be cheap centralized knock-offs — basically old-paradigm businesses posing as new-paradigm movements. It's the next big thing if you believe that new ideals will win out over old. It's a dead and stupid technology if you use old-world metrics.

Re: Bitcoin and Ethereum. They are different in scope, but also in culture. Bitcoin isn't developing and moving forward, because there is no support for that. It is supposed to move slow, work, and not make significant updates. There is a team developing the most common software for Bitcoin, called Bitcoin Core, but if they were to draw up bold new directions in the name of wider adoption (while sacrificing other aspects) then most node operators may oppose it and kill the ideas in the cradle. Technically, this is true of Ethereum, too. The network is launched and operating. There is no update or change to the network that can happen without the support if node operators, and miners. But Ethereum has a history of more flexibility, and people rallying behind the  core developers. Ethereum is a work in progress until 2.0, which is a scary but super promising thing. Until then it's slow and expansive, but everyone still use it because of network effects. Have you checked out DeFi at all? I would at the very least look into MakerDAO and Uniswap, those form a basis for the rest of the ecosystem.",2021-02-02 06:47:03

cooltrainerval,"oh! ok. that makes much more sense.
disclosure that i don't have experience with AAVE.

makerDAO works as a platform from which you can loan against collateral in a smart contract.  dapps can then be built on that to reach users, both lenders and lendees can interact with one another using the ethereum block chain.  Maker (MKR) tokens are what are used to verify any network changes, rate adjustments, updates, etc.  theres quite a lot of power in having a say in the process as a token holder.  
i've found makerDAO is nice for a line of credit that i can borrow against to make stablecoins to use in the alt market.  there is a small interest charged on this balance.

compound on the other hand i've found is a handy way to lend your stablecoins.  the APY's are good and your funds stay yours by way of a token indicating the current state of your loan.

so in my (somewhat) limited experience they've been kinda two prongs of a credit/trading/savings system. stablecoins are the main factor here. being able to access more trading pairs by having a baseline token to trade between allows more complex transactions to happen. makerDAO has been nice whenever i need an influx of liquidity to take another position, but compound is nice to have interest accruing in the background.",2021-02-02 11:51:43

HiPattern,"I think r/ethfinance is a great and friendly place to learn!

Then I'd start wirh reading up on DAI and makerdao, wiki is a good starting point:
""Dai (cryptocurrency) - Wikipedia"" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dai_(cryptocurrency)

Then AMMs (automatic market makers) like uniswap are important part of the defi infrastructure.

And then synthetic assets, as created with collateral similar to DAI e.g. on synthetix are quite fascinating.

Or kind of automatic hedgefunds like YFI are cool.

Or melon protocol, which offers on chain hedgefunds.

Then if you start to get annoyed about fees: layer 2 is coming, with very fees(like 1/1000 or less). Some protocols like synthetix are already moving to layer 2!

the_ocs,"You're right under the majority of cases.

I'm thinking of a black swan type event, like [Black Thursday](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/fio0af/black_thursday_for_makerdao_832_million_was/). Because DAI isn't backed 1-to-1 by its underlying (USD), DAI runs the risk of loosing its peg. This risk is always there, but it's managed by ensuring the collateral is way above 100%. When the collateral value is too low, as I'm sure you know, it's sold off, hence maintaining collateral worth more than the required min level to support the peg.

But what happens if suddenly there a massive market wide crypto crash? This was a higher risk with SAI, but DAI is still made up of many highly correlated assets.

Given the massive price increase we've seen recently, it's not unthinkable that a correction/crash is around the corner.. so that increases the risk of DAI being under-collateralized, should we see such a massive drop. It's also not unreasonable to expect the network to get very busy (high gas price) when the crash is happening, making it operationally difficult to run the needed CDP process and DAI market making.

You should be aware of this and act accordingly. If you sell your non-stable coin crypto, maybe spread it across DAI and USDC, so mix the risk of under-collateralization and centralized censorship.",2021-02-03 22:30:51

maqstica,"Hello! In order to get a sense of what we achieved in 2020, I highly recommend checking out our 2020 Ecosystem Report: [https://docs.zilliqa.com/ecosystem-growth-report-2020.pdf](https://docs.zilliqa.com/ecosystem-growth-report-2020.pdf)

For what's coming next in 2021, here is short summary of things planned:

1. **Dev Tooling and Usability:** We have developed quite a few toolkits for developers to use but I think we need to add a few more and improve upon what we have built so far.
2. **Governance:** Up until now, the core development team has been on the driving seat wrt protocol governance, but, we plan to change it by providing the community the right tools to do so. Through our staking programme, we are distributing governance tokens aka gZIL to the stakers which can then be used to vote on all aspects of the protocol. Just a few weeks ago, we launched a governance portal for gZIL holders to vote on and voted on the first proposal. More will come on this.
3. **DeFi dapps:** In 2020, with the help of our ecosystem partners, we saw staking getting launched and in parallel, a Singapore Dollar backed stablecoin being launched, followed by a DEX, and several fungible tokens. More DeFi dapps such as a MakerDAO-like stablecoin system called Pillar is scheduled for 2021. We expect a lot more token launches as well.
4. **ETH-ZIL Bridge:** We are currently building a bridge between ZIL and ETH. This will bring assets like ETH and other ERC20s on top of Zilliqa including BUSD (Binance USD).
5. **Core protocol optimizations:** Last but not the least, we will continue to improve the platform to increase the throughput and lower the latency.",2021-02-04 02:00:00
maqstica,"I am personally excited about the Pillar protocol which is a decentralized stablecoin somewhat similar to MakerDAO. The interesting thing about Pillar is that we are planning to connect to staking and gZIL holders (gZIL is a governance token issued to stakers). Users can stake their ZILs and earn bonded ZILs called bZIL which will be an interest-bearing token. These bZILs can then be used in Pillar to mint stablecoins called Pillar. Since bZIL is interest bearing, if the parameters are set right, it can cover the interest rate that the Pillar protocol will charge.",2021-02-04 02:22:47
JustMyTwoSatoshis,"I want to toy around with MakerDAO...

Questions (any answers greatly appreciated):

Is there a better alternative to MakerDAO I should consider?

It looks like the stability fee for taking out a loan on ETH has been a very consistent 8.5% for about a year, right?

As an american, if I take out a DAI loan and then sell it for cash to use that cash, is that a taxable event?

Is metamask safe? It sketches me out. I don't see how they can possibl generate a 12 word phrase for me securely using my browser.

Does anyone use trezor or ledger to open their vault? Is it safe? easy?

frank__costello,"I generally agree that crypto-native assets are bad as a medium-of-exchange, but I did want to counter two of your points:

&gt; using real money is frictionless and instant. Buying something with crypto is a pain in the ass and not instant.

This is a technical hurdle, that's being solved. For example, ZK rollup technology allows instant &amp; low cost transactions

&gt; it's supply is inelastic, so it is subject to wild swings in value

There's technology that can be used to stabilize prices as well. MakerDAO is the best example, that uses crypto-native collateral such as ETH &amp; BTC to create a synthetic dollar-pegged token (Dai).

Also, Reflexer Labs is a newer project that is building a volitility-dampened ETH-backed asset.",2021-02-08 23:16:44

frank__costello,"Yep, I agree. Which is why I don't think Bitcoin will ever be used as a medium of exchange.

You should check out MakerDAO, it's sort of like a crypto-federal reserve, it uses crypto collateral to create stable-value assets. Right now it creates a synthetic USD, but the paramaters could easily be adjusted to target other values, such as targeting a certain inflation, etc.

In the future, I believe systems like that will create the medium-of-exchange currencies we use for trade, but they'll be backed by store-of-value assets like Bitcoin.",2021-02-09 01:51:58

CryptoAnarchyst,"&gt;The company I work for hired a bunch of hotshot blockchain developers, thinking it was going to revolutionize the business (custody and accounting admin). 2 years later, it was all disbanded and wound down. The reality didn't match up to the theory. It was overhyped.

I actually have started a business that does that very thing that you mentioned and it pisses me off when I hear the stories about this. It is not that the technology didn't work it is that you had developers trying to do business solutions and that never works out. I've been in business consulting for 20 years and no matter what it is, any time you give a tech geek a license to do whatever they want, it turns out to be the wrong solution... and this is coming form someone who has been a tech geek. They got the wrong people, not the wrong solution.

&gt;I suspect that was the case with a lot of companies as you don't hear as much about blockchain in the news as much. I'm sure there are some industries where it will make sense and make a big difference, but it isn't the grand solution to all problems that it was hyped to be.

I think you are not hearing it because you are not exposed to it. Here are businesses that have already implemented blockchain solutions.

* IBM (IBM)
* Microsoft (MSFT)
* Overstock.com (OSTK)
* Kodak (KODK)
* Amazon (AMZN)
* Oracle (ORCL)
* Intel (INTC)
* Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD)
* Daimler (DAI)
* Walmart (WMT)
* Goldman Sachs (GS)
* Alibaba (BABA)
* VISA (VISA)
* NASDAQ
* NYSE

The list goes on and on. This is not businesses owning bitcoin, NOOO. These are businesses that have either developed their own blockchains or have implemented blockchain solutions from existing sources. The list is growing daily. Amazon has implemented blockchain solution for inventory tracking and distribution, they are also working on a payment system using cryptocurrencies that should go live by the end of the year.

So it is not that the businesses don't see the value in it, they are not advertising it because this is their competitive advantage and they don't want others to catch on just yet.

&gt;Proponents would say, it's a currency - too volatile to be a currency used in everyday transactions.

So, I think you are making the same mistake as majority of people that I have talked about this and you say Crpyto but think Bitcoin. The two are not entirely synonymous. There are stable-coins out there, such as Tether ($USDT), USD Coin ($USDC), MakerDAO ($DAI), etc. that are pegged to the US dollar and do not vary in value. You put a dollar in, you get a dollar out. So stability we have plenty, and payment solutions are abound.  But that is not what this market is about, not even close. The technology underpinning the crypto markets is incredible and the projects that are developing the solutions are blockchain based projects.

&gt;It's not replacing fiat any time soon.

Actually, it is... China has already developed their digital Yuan which has been in testing phase for about 9 months now. They are planning on deploying it by the end of the year globally. This in fact is such a huge threat to the US economic status that the Treasury Department has started a project to digitize the US Dollar. Sadly not much priority has been given the project so the US is far behind. Europe is working on digitizing the Euro, should be in place by 2022, and Russia believes that it will have the digital Ruble in place by end of 2021 (although that is doubtful). Also, Venezuela has the Petro (which has been an utter disaster, but not because of the technology... mostly because of the execution). In the next 3 years all major national currencies will have a digital counterpart, in 5 years paper money will be obsolete due to the incredibly high cost associated with printing and maintaining it.

&gt;It's anonymous - yeah, banks and the government don't like anonymity.

Actually, cash is more anonymous than digital currencies... this is actually why governments will be huge adopters of the digitization of currencies. Every single transaction is recorded on the blockchain. The address of the wallet that it came from and the address of the wallet that it went to, the amount that was transacted, the time it took, and the fee paid for the transaction are all part of the record. So, it is much easier to track and manage.

Banks hate digital currencies not because of the anonymity but because they fundamentally challenge the banks existence. There are projects in the DeFi sector that replace banking needs completely. If you look around you'll find a story about the Australian guy that refinanced his house using DeFi. It took him 3 days to do it. The process is a bit clunky and cumbersome, which is why it took him 3 days... in the near future it will take minutes. How long does it take a bank to refinance? In today's market 45-60 days.

&gt;My thinking has evolved some, I now think of BTC as more of a digital collectible instead of a currency. I personally can't rationalize it, but young people seem to be fine with this digital asset that is literally just some numbers in a ledger.

I think we are not there yet. In 15-20 years we will be but not yet. Businesses are rolling in BILLIONS of dollars into Bitcoin itself right now. They see it as a store of value. Micro Strategy has bought $1.5 Billion of bitcoin in the last 3 months, Tesla has bought the same in the last 2 months. Paypal has enabled crypto payments from and to 28 million of their retailers across the world. Square Inc. is doing the same.

To this date bitcoin is the fastest, most efficient, most cost effective, safest, easiest way to transfer large amounts of money... period. I've sent large transactions within the US and across the globe using both ACH and SWIFT systems, ACH takes days and you get charged a hefty fee... SWIFT takes days-weeks and costs between 1%-3% of the amount as a fee. When you're transferring $100,000,000 from Europe to Asia, that's a hefty fee. It cost a guy $0.47 to transfer $300,000,000 and it was done in less than 10 minutes.

&gt;I'll take a pass on this one. I'll be the old guy holding stocks and collecting dividends.

I can appreciate that. I completely understand that this is not for everyone. The crypto market is high octane environment that has a ton of upside, but nearly as much of downside for some people. I am hoping that I might have convinced you to at least do more research in the field but if not, that is OK too. My goal was not to get anyone to invest in the crypto field but to start an open conversation about a somewhat controversial subject (Like we don't have enough of those), to understand the issues involved, and to learn as well as teach from the experience.",2021-02-09 11:35:39

iwakan,"My biggest gripe with your list is that while you seemed so harsh on XRP for being more decentralized than than many other coins, you completely neglect to mention the much worse centralization in others. The biggest example is probably the stablecoins. USDT, USDC etc are as centralized as they come, by design, so that should be important to note. Meanwhile, the only stablecoin that is NOT centralized, Dai, gets no mention of this which makes it seem like it is the same as the centralized ones, when it is actually in a whole category of its own. You also say that MakerDAO is a company that made Dai. It's not a company, it's a decentralized autonomous organization (it's literally in their name).",2021-02-09 20:51:04
CrushHazard,"&gt;You can’t wear a bitcoin. 

No, but you can post about it on Facebook and Twitter. The last few weeks have shown the power of social media speculation. 

&gt;If gold dropped to zero tomorrow, people would still want to hold it for its other values. If Bitcoin dropped to zero, what are its purposes other than to evade taxes or buy drugs? 

Again, I’m speaking about crypto in general not Bitcoin specifically. But the whole idea of crypto is to decentralize the transfer of money. It’s a bit of a racket nowadays. You can’t even start an account with a big bank without getting hit with all sorts of fees. Gone are the days when banks paid you to keep their money for them. They have managed to get governments in their pocket enough that somehow the middle and working class has to pay the banks fees to hold their money. 

Crypto allows people to securely create savings and initiate transactions at a fair market price — not the price demanded by centralized monopolies. That is the concept that is so valuable to people. 

I don’t think Bitcoin is truly decentralized. The most interesting financial mechanism I see out there right now is MakerDAO. You could potentially buy a house with it. And their DAI currency is currently pegged to the dollar, but it’s always possible that they could break from the dollar and create a more stable paradigm if the dollar crashes.",2021-02-09 22:58:48
randolphmd,"There are many benefits to this but it comes down to this, the loan will likely not be a taxable event.  The other big one, is that you dont lose your exposure to the asset but can realize the capital from your gains.

MakerDAO is a good one too look into.  It has been a while since i checked it out, but my understanding is it works something like you give them custody of a bitcoin and get half the value back in a stable coin.  You can pay off the loan at any point(with interest) to get the full bitcoin back even if it has tripled in value.",2021-02-09 23:31:43

Sharden,"In my experience the most interesting conversations and characters can usually be found on the forums/Discord servers for individual projects that you want to follow. The Ethereum world is just far too big these days to be properly represented in a single forum.

alphamystic007,"There is a lot of ways, here is a really simple one..

Let’s say we tokenism the car, into 36 tokens, at the start Tesla owns all 36 and the owner owns none. Tesla sends the 36 tokens to the cars contract. Each month for 3 years the owner send money (a USD stablecoin) to the smart contract. At anytime the owner can take out his tokens and do what he wants with them. Once the 36th payment is made the remaining tokens are transferred to the owners wallet.

A bit more complicated..

Tesla writes a smart contact based on MakerDAO, the car is again tokenized but this time the owner GENERATES USD stable coins by putting up ETH as collateral which they can pay off later. The owner used the stablecoin to but the cars tokens. Now, this gets the owner a share of the car, which is ALSO collateral and could be used as such.

It just gets wilder from there.",2021-02-10 02:17:00

alphamystic007,"The best isn’t always to have the company take ETH or BTC as payment, because that is the equivalent of selling in the eyes of the IRS and you have to pay tax on those capital gains you are sitting on.

The best is for a company like Tesla to use MakerDAO or similar and make it user friendly and integrated in their ecosystem so it’s a one stop financing experience of sending your ETH to your Tesla wallet and it being held there until the car is paid off. This you get the car, and keep the ETH and because you never sold it there is no capital gains tax to pay.",2021-02-10 03:48:24
TechCynical,"non biased version

1. Bitcoin (BTC): the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
1. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
1. Tether (USDT): a centralized stablecoin which claims to mostly be backed by a reserve of cash however, a single audit of substance has been shown to prove their collateral reserves and has a current ongoing legal case for their shady business practices.
1. Polkadot (DOT): open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
1. Cardano (ADA): Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
1. Ripple (XRP): Remittance token trying to facilitate faster and cheaper transactions across boarders. Currently under judicial pressure from the SEC in the USA.
1. Binance Coin (BNB): coin associated with the Binance exchange and the native token behind binance smart chain.
1. Litecoin (LTC): A fork of bitcoin with an alternative mining algorithm with faster blocktimes.
1. Chainlink (LINK): the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
1. Dogecoin (DOGE): A widely known meme coin within the community however, has no inherit utility by itself.
1. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): fork of Bitcoin aiming to continue the original scaling path of bitcoin with a focus on the base layer. A controversial fork due to crypto politics and unbiased research should be taken by visiting each side of the argument for scaling.
1. Stellar (XLM): talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees.
1. USD Coin (USDC): another centralized stablecoin by coinbase which has verifiable audits for its collateral reserves.
1. Aave (AAVE): take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.
1. Uniswap (UNI): An automated market maker decentralized exchange. In short Uniswap provides a decentralized noncustodial way to exchange assets where UNI is the governance token behind the team.
1. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC): It’s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications.
1. Bitcoin SV (BSV)*: Forked from bitcoin cash after a political upgrade. Aims to scale bitcoin through large blocks and research should be done once again independently to avoid political scaling bias. The debate between btc, bch, and bsv usually relies on security where bitcoin holds the most secure chain in that order.
1. EOS (EOS): another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology.
1. Elrond (EGLD): Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism
1. TRON (TRX): have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
1. Cosmos (ATOM): several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
1. NEM (XEM): instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that
1. Monero (XMR): Monero aims to protect users privacy though completely obstructing transactions which can be useful for commerce, sending payments to other countries where outside money isnt allowed, or personal reasons.
1. THETA (THETA): decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
1. Tezos (XTZ): another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
1. Terra (LUNA): aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
1. Maker (MKR): MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
1. Synthetix (SNX): protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
1. Avalanche (AVAX): open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
1. VeChain (VET): a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
1. Compound (COMP): Decentralized lending and borrowing built on ETH kickstarting DeFi.
1. IOTA (MIOTA): open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
1. Neo (NEO): Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy.
1. Solana (SOL): another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
1. Dai (DAI): the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
1. Huobi Token (HT): it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.
1. SushiSwap (SUSHI): Fork of UniSwap (so a decentralized exchange), where there’s a token (SUSHI) given as an additional reward for liquidity providers and farmers.
1. Binance USD (BUSD): Stablecoin issued by Binance similar to USDT.
1. FTX Token (FTT): It’s a token related to FTX, a platform allowing you to trade leveraged tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. The token allows for lower fees and socialized gains.
1. Crypto.com Coin (CRO): the token of Crypto.com public blockchain, that tries to enable transaction worldwide between people and businesses.
1. Filecoin (FIL): a decentralized storage system, trying to decentralize cloud storage services.
1. UMA (UMA): it builds open-source infrastructure in order to create synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain
1. UNUS SED LEO (LEO): another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.
1. BitTorrent (BTT): BitTorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. It is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds.
1. Celsius (CEL): Celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.
1. Algorand (ALGO): Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
1. Dash (DASH): It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
1. Decred (DCR): it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
1. The Graph (GRT): Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
1. yearn.finance (YFI): part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.",2021-02-10 11:53:45

Spacesider,"&gt;You can't peg something to the value of a centralized asset without also being centralized. 

Yes you can, because ETH itself is decentralised and that is kind of the core philosophy when it comes to blockchain. DAI/MKR are decentralised and run as a smart contract on ETH, which too is decentralised, the thing it is pegged to (USD) is not. Your argument is: USD is centralised, DAI is pegged to USD, there for the MakerDAO smart contract is centralised, and it doesn't make any sense.",2021-02-10 14:59:37
Spacesider,"&gt;A decentralized system cannot, be definition, be affected by centralized entities.

When China banned Bitcoin in September 2017, the price of BTC instantly dropped 6%. By your definition, Bitcoin is centralised because the decision of a centralised entity had an affect on it. How about a few days ago when Elon Musk tweeted about Dogecoin, the price jumped by 31%. By your definition, Dogecoin is centralised because the decision of a centralised entity had an affect on it. Your NANO is also centralised because it was affected by the Bitgrail hack. Go and inform the masses of that last point, you made the definition anyway.

&gt;Explain how decisions made by the United States Federal Reserve have absolutely zero effect on DAI.

I don't think you understand, the MakerDAO smart contract would still be decentralised **regardless of all external decisions that are made**. The reason for this is because the contract has been deployed on Ethereum, which is a decentralised blockchain. The thing it is pegged to (USD) is centralised. The smart contract itself, is not.",2021-02-10 15:35:30
defewit,"Great question! In the DeFi ecosystem there is currently a mix of approaches going from fully immutable contracts, contracts with only specific constants which can be changed via on chain voting, and finally contracts which are fully upgradeable via on chain voting. There's also all of the above but with admin keys instead of on chain voting which is usually done only during the bootstrap phase of a project, usually the signing key is a multisig for security purposes. 

As I'm sure you can see if you think about it, these different approaches have their pros and cons. This is an incredibly nascent industry with much to learn and it seems likely a mix of approaches will continue to be used depending on the application.

alphamystic007,"It’s a secured loan, see here for the MakerDAO app.. https://oasis.app

The advantages are that you don’t need a bank. You don’t need to sell your ETH. You keep your ETH and hence don’t have any capital gains tax liability. You don’t need a to do a credit check and anyone can use it with no eligibility requirements. You don’t need bankers, or banks, or buildings or bank shareholders. You don’t need anything except digital assets and your own responsibilities. 

To do revenue share you make a smart, and anyone that sends ETH to it is considered an owner, then when revenue is generated and added to the contract it is sent to all the owners in proportion to their investment.

Of course, the contract doesn’t know who the owners are, all they have is an ETH address to distribute earnings too.",2021-02-10 21:00:43

Lots of people have stated they have forever stacks, and with defi putting assets to work, I see a scenario where eth might not drop as much. Bitcoin, on the other hand, doesn't have the same context, but currently has a very strong hodl meme/ narrative so it might offset things. 

Personally, I'm not selling my btc (&lt;10% of my portfolio) and I'm not selling 25% of my eth, and mostly holding what I'm willing to sell until $10+k. My defi coins, I have no idea what to do with them tbh, some I'll probably keep most of them long term.

CryptoAnarchyst,"Any time my friend.

A little back to the previous question... Vitalink is an autistic genius. As such, sadly he doesn't understand social cues and underpinning norms of a society. He is smart as hell and can definitely tell you an incredible amount about physics, coding, theoretical economics, math... you name it. The problem being that there is much more to things than just black and white, the social norms make the world grey and that's what has caused some serious issues with the Ethereum network and the further development of the blockchain. Are his points valid? In a vacuum for sure but when you apply the concepts to the real world they really don't translate well. I think that the development of Ethereum 2.0 network is an important step forward, the problem is that I think they are a bit too late. DeFi is really taking over the network and the fees are crippling usability.

So that being said. Let's get to your recent question. I really don't understand what you're meaning. You have Tether Dollar ($USDT), USD Coin ($USDC), MakerDAO ($DAI), Tether Euro ($EURT), and many other stablecoins that are easy to get into and provide benefits of transfering money across vast distances instantly.

I think you see blockchain as a form of payment, which it is not. It can be, but that is not the sole purpose of the blockchain.

Currently Bitcoin is establishing itself as a store of value that is recession proof. That is an important step towards mass adoption of crypto. Just like any new asset that sees an influx of cash during the early stages, Bitcoin is going through some growing pains. But that doesn't mean that this is bad. Bigger Bitcoin gets, the smaller fluctuations will become and more stable it will be. The futures market in crypto is another way to prevent wild swings. As the currency goes too far one way or another it becomes more expensive to continue that trend. This is not really evident in current stock markets. So as you grow, and as you extend the options markets, the stability will come in as we get bigger. But don't think that this will be any time soon. The growth is just starting so the price will swing up radically over the next few months, even a couple of years.

Ethereum is establishing itself as the economic hub. If Bitcoin is the store of value, then Ethereum is becoming it's Wall Street. The DeFi sector blew up in the last year and we are just getting started with it.

Think about this. The Global Banking/Finance industry is a $26Trillion behemoth, gold market share is $10Trillion. Overall Crypto market share is $1.2 Trillion, $800 billion of which belong to Bitcoin. So even if we take up 30% of those we will be at $10 Trillion valuation, $5Trillion of which will be Bitcoin.

So what I would say is expect more growth, more expansion, more chop. If you need to transfer stable currency use stablecoins. What this market is right now is growth, rapid expansion, more products to the market, and taking on the banking and Wall Street industries because the decentralized marketplace can do it faster, cheaper, and safer.",2021-02-11 09:37:05

maqstica,"I will forward the interview comment to the marketing team. We often do interview in different forms written, audio and video.   


I discuss in this video our DeFi plans for the year: [https://twitter.com/maqstik/status/1358888266121023499?s=20](https://twitter.com/maqstik/status/1358888266121023499?s=20)  


More generally, in 2021, we will focus on the following key areas:

1. Dev Tooling and Usability: We have developed quite a few toolkits for developers to use but I think we need to add a few more and improve upon what we have built so far.
2. Governance: Up until now, the core development team has been on the driving seat wrt protocol governance, but, we plan to change it by providing the community the right tools to do so. Through our staking programme, we are distributing governance tokens aka gZIL to the stakers which can then be used to vote on all aspects of the protocol. Just a few weeks ago, we launched a governance portal for gZIL holders to vote on and voted on the first proposal. More will come on this.
3. DeFi dapps: In 2020, with the help of our ecosystem partners, we saw staking getting launched and in parallel, a Singapore Dollar backed stablecoin being launched, followed by a DEX, and several fungible tokens. More DeFi dapps such as a MakerDAO-like stablecoin system called Pillar is scheduled for 2021. We expect a lot more token launches as well.
4. ETH-ZIL Bridge: We are currently building a bridge between ZIL and ETH. This will bring assets like ETH and other ERC20s on top of Zilliqa including BUSD (Binance USD).
5. Core protocol optimizations: Last but not the least, we will continue to improve the platform to increase the throughput and lower the latency.",2021-02-11 23:32:54

frank__costello,"&gt; Nano has better SoV properties than Bitcoin, the main one being no inflation

One problem is that there's no incentive for running nodes and AFAIK no constraint on state growth. Seems unsustainable, but again I haven't researched it deeply.

&gt; However, if you don’t think a volatile crypto can be used for payments, why are you in the space?

For one thing, I think being a sound SoV is a perfectly good use case for cryptos, they don't need to be used for payment. There's plenty of countries that use one money for payments and another (usually USD) for savings

&gt; Any stable coin that is pegged to a centralized asset is the antithesis of what Cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin were trying to innovate / improve upon

How familiar are you with MakerDAO? I think the future of money will look something like MakerDAO, but instead of being pegged to the USD, it will target low inflation, similar to how the US Fed is supposed to operate.

Heya, I replied below before seeing the full thread where you already replied to my question from there🤦

Creating the DSProxy is the first step required when interacting with MakerDAO for the first time - it's the smart contract that will hold all your future Maker positions (CDPs or Vaults as they're called).

If you're creating an ETH CDP - then the next step will be to create the actual position, so you can head back to [https://app.defisaver.com/makerdao/create-cdp](https://app.defisaver.com/makerdao/create-cdp), enter wanted settings and hit create again.

If it's non-ETH one, there's also a token approval needed in-between those two steps.

ethereumflow,"Scalability: Tx per second but also finality. Cosmos being pBFT(practical byzantine fault tolerant) means it has instant finality. Bitcoin and Ethereum have fast finality yes but it is deterministic. With Cosmos as long as less than 2/3 of the network are byzantine(meaning anything out of the ordinary or malicious) then you can be sure that your transaction will be confirmed as soon as a block is created. 

Security is through validators. Ethereum offers a shared security model meaning to use Ethereum you need to pay for their security; this makes sense in many applications such as AAVE and MakerDAO but not so much for something like cryptokitties or Aragon governance. Using the MakerDAO example: MakerDAO issues DAI, we all know this. When using DAI you are paying for the security of Ethereum but only get the security of MKR. If someone were to attack MakerDAO they wouldn't go after Ethereum, that is too big, they would attack MakerDAO because it is less secure. Another example is Polkadot. With Parachain you are forced to use Polkadot shared security and rely on their relay chain. Cosmos offers shared security but rather than forcing it it has been kept optional. Cosmos chains are sovereign by default with their own validators and their own sovereign security and governance. It is all about choice. 

Decentralization: To me this is the most important one. Decentralization is very subjective to both user opinion and network bias. Some say Cosmos is centralized because there are only 125 validators(recently added from 100) but I repsond to that with the on chain governance offered. Cosmos is governed by the network validators and each holder individually. Every proposal that is passed must go through not only a voting process but also a governance discussion prior to. Ethereum on the other hand is governed by the Ethereum Foundation. I know anyone can submit a proposal but the decision if it gets implemented or not ultimately lands with one core group who ultimately follow a bit of a dictatorship under Vitalik. 

Regarding PoS decentralization: Who has been spinning up and deploying ETH 2.0 validators? Where are the majority of users going to stake? Binance first, Kraken second, altcoins third. Cosmos validators are all community operated and contribute to the network but have different focuses. Kraken and Binance have validators there as well but most people using Cosmos wallets ignore the exchanges in favour of network validators. Cosmos core devs are a group of validators and Tendermint Inc. contracts the validators for jobs as well as the new community pool funding. The validators work in many networks in most cases as well. Governance is on chain and all decisions are decided by the network, not any one central figure.",2021-02-13 03:56:18

The longer these projects stay integrating into Ethereum, the harder it will be for them to get out of it while keeping its value.

Just to stay in the point at hand: no, BAT can not migrate to Cardano. In fact it is almost impossible task. Just by changing the chain, it wouldn't be the same BAT that was offered as part of the ICO, so how Brave would have to go legally about making the transition? Making a buy-back? What about those users who don't want to change chains - e.g, users who have BAT locked on the a Maker Vault and do not want to give up on their loans? Would BAT have to run a cross-chain system? Minting and burning the token is already impossible due to the limits of the BAT smart contract, so how would the migration happen?

Take all of these things into consideration, and make it exponentially more complex by putting all the interactions between different projects. It will be easier to improve Ethereum than to move away from it.",2021-02-13 07:10:15
nikola_j,"Depends what you're trying to do. MakerDAO is very well optimized in terms of basic protocol interactions, yes, but as soon as you add more steps into the the mix like we do at DeFi Saver, things get pricey.

One protocol interaction is doable for most, even at 100, 150, 250 Gwei. But when there's three+ interactions (e.g. Aave flash loans, Maker management, Uniswap trade) gas usage adds on and the overall fee gets hefty - greatly exacerbated by continously high gas prices.

Some suggestions are to time transactions (e.g. late evenings UTC or weekends, this [heatmap](https://gitcoin.co/gas/heatmap) may help) and stick with lower leverage levels so no urgent transactions would be needed in case of market retraces. There's also the option of using gas tokens (as mentioned [here](https://forum.defisaver.com/t/using-gas-tokens-to-reduce-transaction-fees-at-defi-saver/37)), where we'll also have support for CHI besides GST2 soon. And we're of course closely following on L2 developments should some of the lending major protocols decide to launch L2 versions.",2021-02-13 08:02:50

Muchronzot,"I've got the whole solution for you.

It came out yesterday in blue chip edition.

GBI is a fully collateralised, passive strategy index that tracks some of the biggest large-cap digital assets in the crypto / DeFi value stack in one ERC-20 token.

In the index you have 8 constitutes

1. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)
2. Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)
3. MakerDAO (MKR)
4. ChainLink (LINK)
5. [Yearn.Finance](https://Yearn.Finance)(YFI)
6. Uniswap (UNI)
7. [Compound.finance](https://Compound.finance)(COMP)
8. SpiceDAO(SPICE)

(copied from site )$GBI can be obtained in one of two ways:

1. **Market purchase:** [$GBI is available via Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xcb67be5c54eab9462967ee3c03c35bfffeb801cd) or any other DEX. Mission Control will also pursue CEX listings, however, this will not be completed immediately.
2. **Minting $GBI:** To do so, you will need to perform a smart contract interaction with a wallet that contains all of the above assets. The details on how this is done can be [read in our documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vS1i7l547NktOQcjaxQcYRj-BnawC6wqTd9c6ZOeVX45Jqy-kvINr5aqpA0w8WtUJNf-IFfNHL3j-lI/pub)

ONG is higher than I’ve ever seen it and staking is becoming more worth it. 

Li Jun, one of the cofounders, refers to Ontology as a decentralized trust network that facilitates transfer of data. They are focused on ownership of data and are in fact opposite of the social control system that people think they are building in China.",2021-02-14 05:14:27
Renegadegold,"For the newcomers: the top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence.

I tried summing up the top 50 coins in 1 or 2 sentences. It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.


1.	⁠Bitcoin (BTC): the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2.	⁠Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3.	⁠Tether (USDT): a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4.	⁠Polkadot (DOT): open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5.	⁠Cardano (ADA): Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6.	⁠Ripple (XRP): centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7.	⁠Binance Coin (BNB): coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8.	⁠Litecoin (LTC): Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9.	⁠Chainlink (LINK): the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10.	⁠Dogecoin (DOGE): Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11.	⁠Bitcoin Cash (BCH): fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12.	⁠Stellar (XLM): talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13.	⁠USD Coin (USDC): another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14.	⁠Aave (AAVE): take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.
15.	⁠Uniswap (UNI): Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it’s an exchange like Binance, just decentralized.
16.	⁠Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC): It’s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications.
17.	⁠Bitcoin SV (BSV)*: Bitcoin Scam Variant
18.	⁠EOS (EOS): another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology.
19.	⁠Elrond (EGLD): Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism
20.	⁠TRON (TRX): have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21.	⁠Cosmos (ATOM): several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22.	⁠NEM (XEM): instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that
23.	⁠Monero (XMR)*: if you need drugs
24.	⁠THETA (THETA): decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25.	⁠Tezos (XTZ): another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26.	⁠Terra (LUNA): aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27.	⁠Maker (MKR): MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28.	⁠Synthetix (SNX): protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29.	⁠Avalanche (AVAX): open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30.	⁠VeChain (VET): a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31.	⁠Compound (COMP): It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32.	⁠IOTA (MIOTA): open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33.	⁠Neo (NEO): Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34.	⁠Solana (SOL): another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35.	⁠Dai (DAI): the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36.	⁠Huobi Token (HT): it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.
37.	⁠SushiSwap (SUSHI): a clone of UniSwap (so a decentralized exchange), where there’s a token (SUSHI) given as an additional reward for liquidity providers and farmers.
38.	⁠Binance USD (BUSD): Stablecoin issued by Binance, tied to USD.
39.	⁠FTX Token (FTT): It’s a token related to FTX, a platform allowing you to trade leveraged tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. The token allows for lower fees and socialized gains.
40.	⁠Crypto.com Coin (CRO): the token of Crypto.com public blockchain, that tries to enable transaction worldwide between people and businesses.
41.	⁠Filecoin (FIL): a decentralized storage system, trying to decentralize cloud storage services.
42.	⁠UMA (UMA): it builds open-source infrastructure in order to create synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain
43.	⁠UNUS SED LEO (LEO): another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.
44.	⁠BitTorrent (BTT): BitTorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. It is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds.
45.	⁠Celsius (CEL): Celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.
46.	⁠Algorand (ALGO): Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
47.	⁠Dash (DASH): It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48.	⁠Decred (DCR): it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49.	⁠The Graph (GRT): Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50.	⁠yearn.finance (YFI): part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.


*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

•	⁠Bitcoin SV (BSV): It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
•	⁠Monero (XMR): Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.

Exirr,"actually seems pretty interesting, kind of like a mix of MakerDAO and Comp.  


The whitepaper is here for anyone reading:  
[https://venus.io/Whitepaper.pdf](https://venus.io/Whitepaper.pdf)  


it says:  


""XVS is distributed via a fair-launch mechanism with no founder and team allocations, backed by an already well-funded organization and the team over at Swipe, a Binance portfolio company""  


So by the sounds of things the 'well-funded organisation' is either Binance, or Swipe (which is a sub-company of binance). I think Binance will want it to do well considering it's one of the bigger BSC projects right now.

HCloridric,"T'inquiète, j'ai une très bonne connaissance de la DeFi, mais je ne suis pas un YieldFarmer, c'est une course qui, je trouve, ne produit rien sinon une multiplication de protocoles qui au final sont identiques les uns aux autres.

Les vault de Maker DAO n'ont rien inventés, mettre des actifs en collatéral pour avoir de la liquidité est un processus qui se fait couramment en CeFi. Leur génie est d'avoir mis en place un stablecoin décentralisé, ça oui. Pour compound et AAVE ils n'ont rien inventé. C'est d'ailleurs comme ça que Musk trouve ses liquidités.

En quoi Compound est une tuerie des livret A? De nouveau, ce n'est jamais qu'un agrégateur de liquidité décentralisé. Rien à voir avec les livrets A.

Je suis d'accord sur le faite qu'on s'affranchit des intermédiaires. Mais de nouveau, qu'en est-il de la fracture numérique? Tu vas expliquer à tes parents/grands-parents comment utiliser la DeFi?

Les intérêts composés c'est accessible pour le commun des mortels, ça dépend juste des produits financiers que tu utilises. Ce n'est pas parceque tu ne sais pas que ça existe que ça n'existe pas.

La corruption des élus, c'est une autre histoire. De nouveau, c'est dans la rue que ça se règle, pas informatiquement. Si la population ne met pas la pression sur ses élus, les cryptos seront juste régulées pour ne plus être menaçantes, c'est tout.

La déflation caractéristique du monde libéral? Tu ris ou quoi? Regarde 100 ans en arrière, elle est ou ta déflation? ça n'a strictement rien à voir. 

A nouveau, explique moi le mécanisme économique qui fait que la déflation est un avantage économiquement pour la société ? Tu n'arrive pas à répondre à cette question, basique, que je pose depuis le début. Avoir un actif déflationniste est un avantage individuel quand la société est inflationniste, ça on est d'accord. Mais quel est l'avantage sociétal que ta monnaie soit déflationniste? Tu réfléchis en tant qu'individu. Moi ce qui m'intéresse, c'est le point de vue global. Imagine si demain tout les états décides de passer leur économie en BTC, et après? Que se passera-t-il?

Tu mélanges tout c'est incroyable, en quoi le minage permet de voter? Regarde ce qu'il se passe actuellement sur ETH avec EIP1559, en quoi les mineurs s'imposent sur le réseau? Est-ce seulement souhaitable que les mineurs s'imposent sur le réseau ?

Donc tu es contre l'héritage? Pour toi on naitrait avec une quantité d'argent et à notre mort, le non utilisé serait détruit? En vrai ça me plait \^\^'

Un patriote? ça veut rien dire un patriote. Napoléon était un patriote, ça ne l'a pas empêcher de mener une partie de sa population à la ruine. Mao était un patriote, ça ne l'a pas empêcher de mener sa population à la famine. Hitler était un patriote, je ne m'attarderai même pas dessus. Et j'en passe des comme ça. Un système qui se base sur la bonne volonté de ses acteurs est un système instable qui finira par éclater. Un système stable est un système qui pousse ses acteurs, en agissant par égoïsme individuel, à participer à bien portance du réseau. C'est précisément ce qui fait la base de la blockchain. MakerDAO en est le meilleur exemple : mêler les égoïsmes individuels pour arriver à un actif stable.

La richesse de l'Europe s'est bâtie sur la domination du reste du monde. La richesse des USA s'est bâtie sur la domination du monde. Evidemment qu'en perdant cette domination on perd de facto une partie notre richesse. Le monde est fait d'empire qui se font et se défont, quelque soit leur système monétaire. L'étalon Or n'a pas empêché des empires de s'éteindre.

Le bitcoin comme de l'or numérique? Quelle blague. Lis seulement son whitepaper. ça n'a jamais été comme ça qu'il a été défini. Le bitcoin c'est une monnaie. Le mythe du bitcoin comme or numérique c'est un narratif inventé par les bitcoin maximalist quand il devenait évident que le Btc n'était pas capable de se mettre à l'échelle de la population mondiale comme une monnaie rapide et bon marchée. Mais il y a tellement de milliards en jeu qu'il faut bien trouver un autre narratif pour lui trouver une utilité. L'or est une valeur refuge parcequ'il a une histoire. Le BTC comme or numérique c'est un narratif qui se met en place actuellement. Et le pire c'est que ça marche. Quand j'ai commencé à entendre parler du bitcoin, PERSONNE ne parlait de ça. bitcoin était une monnaie. Et aujourd'hui, il a failli en tant que monnaie.

En quoi Theter c'est une planche à billet? Est-il si difficile à admettre que plus la valeur investie dans les cryptos à augmenté plus la société theter à été sollicitée pour fournir des USDT? Seul stablecoin à l'époque? C'est exactement ce qu'ils se passe avec le DAI, l'USDC et le BUSD. Tout ce qu'on peut reprocher à theter c'est de ne pas être transparent, mais est-ce étonnant? C'est une version primitive des stablecoins après tout.

Ether est inflationniste, tout comme bitcoin. Tu peux le nier tant que tu veux, le faite est que pour le moment (ça va sans doute changer), il est inflationniste.

Et je repose à nouveau la question ; en quoi est-ce bénéfique pour une société d'avoir une monnaie déflationniste ?

Franchement quand je t'entends, tu me fais penser à tout ces gens qui crachent sur leurs institutions sans savoir la chance qu'ils ont en souhaitant une bonne guerre. Je suis passé par une étape de ma vie ou j'étais dans la merde, moi et ma copine, à cause de problèmes de santé. Dans d'autres pays on se serait vraiment retrouvé dans la merde. Ici non, grâce au chômage, grâce à la sécurité sociale, et j'en passe. J'imagine que tu fais partie de ces gens qui crie au vol quand on le taxe sur ses plus values? Alors oui effectivement, ça se dégrade de jour en jour, mais ce n'est pas en achetant du BTC et en attendant que ça se pête la gueule que ça va s'arranger. Non, c'est à nous citoyens de militer pour éviter d'avoir des faux choix dans l'offre politique (je vous souhaite bon courage avec Lepen-Macron au second tour en 2022), et pour préserver des acquis sociaux, et ça ça se fait dans les médias (payer un abonnement c'est déjà un acte militant. Faire un don à une association citoyenne aussi), dans les associations citoyennes, et dans la rue.

Alors tu fais partie de ces gens qui ont de la chance d'avoir de l'argent pour se permettre de se casser quand tout partira en couille si un jour ça part en couille. Tant mieux pour toi, personnellement je trouve ça égoïste. Le jour ou je pourrai m'affranchir du salariat grâce aux cryptos, je vais certainement pas utiliser cette argent pour me barrer, au contraire, ce sera l'occasion de m'impliquer socialement et sociétalement.",2021-02-15 22:32:08
rawtxapp,"If you're fine with centralized there's blockfi and celsius, if you want decentralized makerdao is the most trustworthy.

rawtxapp,"MakerDAO is the best imo, the interface is much more straightforward, no need for KYC, you're not trusting a centralized entity, instead you're trusting a decentralized smart contract that you can audit yourself.

It let's you keep borrowing against the same collateral if it goes up in value or you can withdraw a portion of your collateral. No set schedule, it compounds every block (every 15 minutes), you can pay it back however you like or if like me you don't expect to get your collateral back, you're using it as a credit line, you won't have to pay any debt as long as Bitcoin's value keeps increasing and you're being conservative with your borrowing.

The only con is having to use wrapped Bitcoin, but it's transparent and BitGo's has been pretty trustworthy.

CarsonRoscoe,"No, not saying getting a loan to buy a car or house, he's saying using the car or house as collateral on a different loan.

For example, in the real world, people will take their $500k home and use it as collateral for another loan, to go buy a second house. You can take that second house and use it as collateral on a loan for a third house. IIRC the rate before 2008 was 90%, as in a $500k asset can be collateralized and used on a $450k loan, then that loan buys a house which you collateralize and use on a $405k loan, which you buy a house with and collateralize and use for a $365k loan, etc.

Basically what MakerDAO does for collateralizing ETH/WBTC to create DAI, or Compound Finance do for collateralizing a bunch of tokens to loan a bunch of other tokens, that's not some made up thing. That's how the banking world works. Rich people can buy a $10m yacht, then take out a $9m loan on the yacht so now they have both the yacht and most their money. If the yacht drops in value to $5m, the bank fucked up and loses money",2021-02-16 02:42:18
cryptOwOcurrency,"I'm not too worried about the market eventually finding a standard. The network effect chose Ethereum, it chose MakerDAO, on the library layer it chose OpenZeppelin, and I believe it will converge on a Layer-2 standard too.",2021-02-16 04:26:56
lautaro_,"I'd like to work... If only there was a job which I can apply that isn't paying $230 in the best case. I can make that in a few days of trading with $5000. Not even worth it. I'm richer than 95% of the population of my shitty country because I speculated in crypto. I never worked, but wish I did, because I would be a millionaire with the same ROI I had but having had a few thousands dollars (pocket change for americans) in 2016. Sadly, I only had $210.

If you have a good paying job, however, you can multiply your money with cryptocurrencies if you enter at the right moment and cash-out in time. Not even all your money. A few thousands, as I said, can become hundreds of thousands or millions with a few years and some luck. Worst case, you lose part of it in some coins.

There isn't a better investment, except for venture capital, maybe. If your career means you're a programmer, even better, you can participate in some crypto project and make it happen creating your own. For example, a guy from my country is a key person in MakerDAO and helped create DAI, which is pretty popular here and he maybe worth a few hundred thousands (which is big fortune).",2021-02-16 07:25:13
bronchor,"Right, you're describing something similar to the MakerDAO and Dai system. I guess I was just confused to your emphasis on it being an inflationary currency. There's already an algorithmically balanced stablecoin concept ready to be launched on Cardano called AgeUSD. It improves on some of the core principles the MakerDAO and Dai protocols pioneered. Perhaps AgeUSD (or a future iteration) could become a world reserve currency like you are hoping for.",2021-02-16 16:03:58
First_Magician,"True. That's what I don't like about MakerDAO for example. 

It's a great project no doubt, but since they consider only the amount of coins/tokens voted for the proposal and disregard the number of voters, decision making can potentially get quite privileged.

Successful projects sooner or later attract whales. What's the difference then between a purchased seat at the board of a traditional enterprise and a group of whales controlling the voting? 

The decision-making could end up rather centralized. It's worth exploring other alternatives where this doesn't happen.",2021-02-16 16:47:57
ZionEnglish,"I know this is the compound subreddit, but this triggered a question. If i understand correctly, MakerDAO burns MKR tokens to cover liquidity issues like you mention. Of course it only prolongs the issue should it become a massive crash, but, does this mean that MKR has some sort of cushion against a “bad day” in the market? Or do i understand incorrectly? Does compound have a similar mechanism?",2021-02-16 16:53:59
Alarming_Reply_9572,MakerDAO will issue more MKR to cover the losses if they become under collateralized.  This protects the protocol at the expense of MKR token holder dilution. I think COMP should have a similar back up collateralization method!  They should issue COMP if protocol becomes under collaterized,2021-02-16 18:03:35

You can interact with MakerDAO and feel, hands-on, how central banks work - organisations that in the real world have profound effects on the world you live in. How is that not amazing?

coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; MakerDAO’s Multi-Collateral DAI (MCD), a program offering borrowers no-hassle credit against their crypto assets, has $6B+ worth of crypto asset collateral backing 2B+ DAI, their $1 pegged stablecoin. DAI has $4B+ in total liquidity, had $1B+ trading volume yesterday, and it was uploaded only 9 months ago. MakerDAO is launching DAI as an alternative to pegged stablecoins.

You asked if you send your coins to a random address and trust someone to send them back to you and I told you that you don't.

If you actually wanted the answers to those questions, you would be thanking me for educating you about that, or asking me follow-up questions, not changing the subject.

&gt; once the traders can’t pay their margin the whole system will bust.

When people couldn't pay back their margins during ""Black Thursday"" and the MakerDAO liquidation system went bust while the Ethereum network crawled more or less to a standstill, stablecoin lenders still didn't lose any money, but keep telling yourself that.

It's all one big ""Ponzi scheme"" that's creating new credit markets and matching an increasing number of peer to peer borrowers and lenders, but it's a Ponzi scheme after all.",2021-02-18 08:43:20
10xwannabe,"Sounds cool, but seems it is selling at a 6% premium.  That means if you bought the same amount in ethereum amd makerdao it would be cheaper then buying this stock that holds the same coins.  Not sure why one would pay MORE for the sum of its parts.

CosmicCollusion,"So DAI has taken a bit of flack over the last while as it gets more and more backed by more centralized coins like USDC, Tether etc. and a lot of people lamented over how they wished there was still SAI. Now that RAI has been released how many people actually plan to make a switch, show of hands?  

It's a tough call for me, as MakerDAO has been around for so long and without any hacks\*, most people see it as about as safe as you get in ETH in terms of contract risk, alongside Uniswap. But if you follow the Bankless protocol sink thesis, it seems likely that a ""stablecoin"" backed entirely by the most trustless asset we have, ETH, with minimized governance at that...should sink down lower than MakerDAO and DAI. I think I'll slowly migrate from using DAI to RAI over time as I gain more confidence that it's safe and it gets main-net battle tested.",2021-02-18 16:08:12

Epyr,"Neither of those is actually decentralized like they claim.

Makerdao is pegged 1-1 to USD so is therefore completely controlled by the centralized fiscal policies of the American treasury.

questioningmoney,"$RAI is a stablecoin by Reflexer Labs is like a competitor to MakerDAO. It's pretty interesting, but also more complex where a way that we'll have to see whether the stability algorithm holds. 

I've been waiting for a legit ETH-only DAI competitor since DAI went multi collateral. I am skeptical of the multi-collateral approach llong-termong term. 

Basically it works like this - you deposit $150 of ETH into a smart contract as collateral, and then take out a loan of $100 worth of RAI, which you now owe as debt. You need to pay that back in order to get your ETH again. So if you can double that $RAI through a trade or whatever so now you have $200 worth of RAI, then you pay back the $100 worth of debt, get your ETH back, and profited $100.

BuyETHorDAI,"Well no surprise. Imagine taking Ethereum and running it on 21 servers instead of thousands and thousands of nodes. Well, you get BSC. Here's the question though, is BSC DeFi? I'd argue that it's not. There's zero chance something like MakerDAO and DAI would get built on BSC because the risk is way too high.

Sharden,"If everything is going well, it isn’t. New MKR is minted to cover bad debt in the event a rapid collapse in the price of any of the collateral assets triggers a liquidation and the value of the auction on that liquidation doesn’t fully cover the debt. In that case the system mints new MKR and sells it on the market. 

In the long run though, if MKR holders do a good job governing the protocol, the total MKR supply should shrink over time as MKR gets burned. If we do a bad job and chase risky ventures, we will run into more situations where we mint MKR and dilute our holdings. 

The best representation of the burn system that I know of is [makerburn](https://makerburn.com/#/). 

Note that I don’t consider myself an expert on the subject, and you’ll find more insightful discussion on the MakerDAO forum rather than Reddit if you are interested 🙂",2021-02-19 09:25:49
ahbartsch,"Sure.

MakerDAO allows anyone with specific tokens to open a Vault and mint DAI off of their collateral (the tokens deposited). The ""peg"" of DAI ($1) is controlled through rate changes (simplified) controlled by MKR holders/voters.

Aave is a money market that allows anyone to deposit specified tokens and gain interest on those tokens as well as using them as collateral to borrow any other tokens in the money market. These tokens are pooled and have dynamic rates (algorithmically controlled) for borrowing/lending based on supply and demand.

In MakerDAO you can only ""borrow"" DAI by minting with your collateral. In Aave you can borrow any of the tokens other users have deposited as well as gain interest on your deposits (lend) which borrowers pay as interest.",2021-02-19 09:41:36

These projects take months to years of developing/testing and even longer to organically grow once they make it to livenet.

Not to mention even if Cardano does blow up how many transactions can it do right now? Even if it’s more than ethereum it still isn’t enough to meet demand. Then you’ll hear arguments that it could do X amount once xyz update comes out which would put Cardano exactly in the same boat as Ethereum: waiting on an update to really scale.  Cardano’s transactions are in the cents because it has 1/50th of Ethereums activity. Full stop. 

I know it’s sucks that most people didn’t get into Ethereum when it’s market cap was 30 billion and want to find the next Ethereum so they can make bank but honestly Eth is hard to beat.

I don't plan on ever repaying that debt by making sure that my borrowing is very conservative and will never be liquidated. As long as Bitcoin goes up, I have like a credit line that's getting bigger and bigger every day.",2021-02-22 01:00:32

CarsonRoscoe,"There are benefits to what Binance is doing here. It has all the transparency of ETH, the same instant audits, we same ability to prove any funnybusiness that might go on, what it lacks is decentralized nodes. Basically, Binance has the ability to update their nodes and force a fork, but past that they can't do anything malicious without everyone knowing. It holds them accountable and lets us know their track record, compared to banks and databases where we know squat and can audit squat.

Still, xDai exists so I see no reason to use Binance Chain. Just saying, if I was Binance and in their executives boots, I would see myself making the same choice and justifying it that its transparent and keeps us accountable while providing mostly the same benefits of ETH.

But wow, xDai is amazing.. Yesterday is the first time I used it, with my Ledger/MetaMask using Honeyswap (Uniswap). It has all the same benefits of Binance Chain (faster block times and virtually no fees due to centralized nodes), except the nodes arent all run by Binance, they're run by ""Trusted"" groups. For example, MakerDAO runs one of the xDai nodes, and the STAKE governance token means nodes don't have the right to make proposal changes to distribution, users do, nodes just run the chain and keep each other honest.",2021-02-22 02:58:58

meckanical,"As far as defi contracts go, the price would have to fall very fast within the span of a single block. Your example of falling by 50% faster than the ability to liquidate is just not likely. Here is a real example from MakerDAO:

If I put $1500 worth of eth into MakerDAO, I can take out at most $1000 worth of the stable coin dai. This would however be a terrible idea, because  it would only take the slightest move down and your position is open for liquidation. The price of eth on the other hand would have to drop by a third within a single block (a few minutes) for the system to be insolvent. It would probably be wise to take volatility into account when deciding your collateralization ratio and liquidation price. 

Yes, the person getting liquidated takes a risk and major punishment if they are liquidated. They should keep that in mind.

There is always the possibility of a black swan event that nobody expected (like a bug in the contract or an attack on price oracles), but this is by design a very unlikely scenario.

Don-Bajon,"Aparentemente, por lo que leí, DAI tiene un respaldo mayor que el que tiene USDT.

DAI está respaldada por tenencias de una empresa (MakerDAO), a razón de 1,5 USD por cada DAI (recordemos que el peg es 1:1).

USDT, en cambio, tiene respaldo por sólo la cantidad de USD que representan los USDT existentes, es decir, un dólar por cada USDT. Igual que DAI, el peg es 1:1.

Que DAI este sobrerrespaldada le da un nivel de solidez mayor. Porque si el valor de los activos que están respaldando las monedas cae, DAI tiene margen, pero USDT no.

Para aclarar, el respaldo no es en dólares físicos (billete), sino en smart contracts; cuando menciono los dólares como respaldo, me refiero al valor en dólares de dichos smart contracts.

Sputnik, the p2p bot exchange, is largely a KAVA led project so I’ve been more engaged with it then even when I was staking KAVA in the past. 

Overall I think they have a great platform. KAVA did a lot of behind the scenes work for Ripple and built a lot of their tooling so that has been integrated where it matters(also why they support XRP). Brian Kerr, the founder, is a hardcore BTC maxi through and through and so are a lot of the team. He was also an XRP maxi but I don’t know if that has changed now. Don’t confuse this as KAVA is part of Ripple though, this is more of a proving point that Ripple didn’t do anything special. 

KAVA has HARD protocol which is slowly growing and is a cross chain DeFi application. They are also the team leading the way for the BTC bridge into Cosmos. ETH/ERC20 will have the Althea Gravity Bridge(formerly Peggy) and KAVA are building the BTC support for Bitcoin with IBC transfers across Cosmos. This development should be starting in Q3/Q4 with BTC:IBC hopefully by early 2022. It’s not a wrapped Bitcoin like on Ethereum it will be a permissionless and trustless BTC peg.

There's no difference in this case - the protocol sees all CDPs as equal.

At the moment of liquidation, your complete position is locked and a 13% penalty is applied to your debt at that moment, with the following auction basically always causing that overally penalty to be higher, usually 15-16% I think, though it always depends on market conditions. Maker liquidations definitely hurt.

nikola_j,"Hey, ArcticPudel, a member of the DeFi Saver team here, so let me provide some more info, just in case.

&gt;the ratio that triggers a repay action should be set a lot higher than the minimum collateralization ratio, is that correct?

The minimum ratio allowed for use in Automation is +20% from the minimum ratio of that vault type, so for ETH-A the minimum configurable is 170%, for ETH-B it's 150% etc.

&gt;there can be steep drops like these days where the next oracle price  update could put the ratio below the minimum in a big jump, basically  'skipping' the range between the minimum ratio and selected repay ratio 

This is something that actually isn't possible, not as of April 2020 when we introduced what we called [Automation v2](https://medium.com/defi-saver/introducing-automation-v2-now-with-flash-loans-and-next-price-support-433040e6d63b), as a response to having that exact issue you mentioned during [Black Thursday](https://medium.com/defi-saver/black-thursday-at-defi-saver-3c35ea6cd0d0).

The way things work now is that Automation keeps track of the \*next\* price in MakerDAO, too, so in case that next price is pushing you below liquidaiton or extremely close to it, an automated Repay will be executed based on that next price, before it becomes the current price in the protocol.

&gt;I'd rather avoid paying high gas fees and selling ETH if there is still some leeway till liquidation 

Good point, definitely, as transaction fees have gone through the roof lately, especially these last two days have been absolutely mad in terms of gas prices we've all seen.

One thing perhaps worth noting is that transaction fees in Automation are charged to the position, and not to your account balance (Automation has no access to your end account). Some people like that and would like to have that same mechanism applied even for any manual transactions, but it still doesn't change the fact transaction fees have gone up significantly lately.

&gt;maybe I'm missing something. 

Just peace of mind, I guess, that's the number one thing people like about Automation, I'm pretty sure. ""I sleep better with this on"" is the most often heard compliment.

Either way, feel free to @ me with any questions on it if you're ever interested in using it.

Good luck with it :)",2021-02-24 09:15:55
nikola_j,"As u/jumnhy and u/brananphan mentioned below, it's a feature we have at DeFi Saver.

It allows MakerDAO users to instantly increase their leverage if they're using the Maker protocol to long ETH.

Specifically, a Boost does three steps in one transaction: borrows more Dai, swaps the  Dai for ETH and adds that ETH back to the CDP (or Vault, as they're also called nowadays).

We have all sorts of leverage management options at DeFi Saver, and for multiple protocols. Like creating an instantly leveraged position in Maker, automated leverage management, or closing a leveraged position in one transaction by clearing debt using supplied collateral. Things like that :)

randomHash9,"What don't you understand?

 - Say Erg is at 1$ for simplicity sake.

- You, and your brother have 100ERG

- You mint 100 erg into SigmaRSV.

- He mints 100 erg into SigmaUSD.

- The price of erg goes up 10%

- You redeem your SigmaRSV for 110erg

- Your brother redeems his SigmaUSD for 90erg (or $100)

- You're rewarded for providing liquidity for the stablecoin.


The 'catch' is that the ReserveCoin is a call option on a % of the ERG held in the reserve. There's locking mechanisms, transaction fees pumped into the reserve, and a bunch of math backing this which is oversimplified for the sake of comprehension. You don't need to pinch yourself - it really is that groundbreaking. 

&gt;The economic model of AgeUSD was designed by IOHK, Ergo, and Emurgo. Its economic model maintains the conservative settings for collateral reserves and avoids the need for liquidations. Along with that, it supports a fully decentralized stablecoin emission setup. Thus, AgeUSD will offer the world a stable, simple, and decentralized stablecoin.


&gt; - SigmaUSD is operated on larger margin requirements than traditional crypto backed stablecoins.
&gt;- SigmaUSD will be backed by ERG in a floating reserve between 4x1 to 8x1.
&gt;- The minimum threshold (4x1) protects SigmaUSD holders, tokens are ALWAYS backed by sufficient ERG for market volatility.
&gt;- The maximum threshold (8x1) protects SigmaRSV holders from experiencing unnecessary dilution of their P/B position. This limits inflationary pressures on SigmaRSV holders.
&gt;- The AgeUSD has a locking mechanisms to keep the Reserves within this range. It is possible that users can temporarily find themselves unable to interact with the contract. This is the alternative to forced liquidations.
&gt;- The Federal Reserve Board reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective March 26, 2020. This action eliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions.
&gt;- The global reserve currency is backed by 0% reserve ratios.
&gt;- SigmaUSD is backed by a MINIMUM 400% reserve ratio. 


Cardano’s Stablecoin Will be ‘Better Than MakerDAO,’ Says Hoskinson

&gt;“For example, we’ve partnered with Emrugo, and we're right now working on the logistics of a stablecoin with them that we're going to be building first on Ergo to verify everything works correctly, and then we'll pull it over into Cardano and this is going to be an algorithmic stablecoin,” said Hoskinson, adding, “We think it'll be significantly better than MakerDAO.”

`Will ageUSD launch with gougen?

&gt; 'I'm gonna see if we can do an ageUSD port after we do native-assets, we already have a Plutus implementation.

Advantage over MakerDAO : No liquidation on price-spike

&gt;Unlike Ethereum-based crypto-backed stablecoins, such as DAI, Emurgo introduces a Staticoin protocol-inspired design that does not rely on CDPs (Collateralized Debt Positions). The reason for this is the vulnerability of CDP-based protocols in terms of high volatility and blockchain congestion.As Emurgo states, “Black Thursday,” when MakerDAO CDPs were triggered for liquidation due to volatility and then sold for $0 due to blockchain congestion that prevented others from bidding, demonstrated that a new design is needed.

MakerDAO is in a class-action lawsuit because they did not mention this risk to anybody. Their UIs and documents said about the liquidation penalty, not that all your collateral gets sold for $0.

The community didn't even vote on the compensation plan. Maker holders have the interest to not pay the victims because it will affect the MKR price on the short term.

rglullis,"All of those looking at ""fees are high in Ethereum, we should move away from it"", keep forgetting to look a little beyond their nose and check the whole ecosystem. 

It's not just BAT. It's BAT *and* MakerDAO (which has BAT vaults, and let you keep your BAT to use DAI as a currency) *and* the DEXs (Uniswap and clones, Balancer, 1inch, the just-announced plan to have BAT DEX), the lending platforms (Aave, Compound which offer BAT loans) and *etc, etc, etc*.

High fees are a *temporary problem*. Layer-2 solutions are [out already in beta](https://exchange.loopring.io) or [about to come with full releases](https://raiden.network) which will seriously alleviate the current congestion. Even if all the above-mentioned projects decided to move away from Ethereum (which they won't), by the time the migration is starting, the layer-2 projects will already be more than ready. Couple that with the ongoing progress of ETH2 and it's easy to realize that there is no chance in hell that the existing projects are looking into moving out of Ethereum now.

This isn't me shitting on other blockchain projects. Competition is healthy and is important that people keep trying improvements. It's just that network effects are real. Cardano will have a better chance if they follow the BSC model and convince new devs to use their platform to make clones of the popular Ethereum projects instead of trying to insist on migration from the established Ethereum ones.",2021-02-24 21:07:50
Smithgift,"Ethereum has come a long way in just a few years. I can tell you that--I ran an Ethereum node at Genesis.

All the way back in Frontier days...

* Transactions didn't exist, at least for the earliest few days. The chain was deliberately started with a gasLimit too low to actually do anything. Over time, there was a race to make the first transactions, then the first contracts...
* GUI Wallets did not exist. You had to use the JS console, and you had to be careful, because an early bug would send your ETH into nothingness if you left off the to field. After that, you still had to be careful because...
* ENS did not exist. But we thought it would be soon, so we didn't have address checksums, either. I don't think we even had the funky circle things.
* Block explorers barely existed. It's been a while, but I remember etherscan starting pretty early. But none of this verified contracts or token pages.
* Stablecoins did not exist. MakerDAO was just a twinkling in Rune's eye. There was a contract that hosted a list of the top ten movies, which could be altered by burning ETH. I suspect that list is now final. But of course stablecoins did not exist, because...
* ERC20 tokens did not exist. There was no standard on the chain, and everyone did what was right in his own eyes. If you're interested in history, you can check out the original issue and see a lengthy discussion on transferFrom vs. cheques. I was on Team Cheque, but in retrospect transferFrom was clearly right. In either case, it wasn't for years before there was a standard ERC20 template code.
* DeFi did not exist at all, unless you count the DAO.
* But maybe this was no surprise, because developing was a pain in the donkey. There were three languages available: Solidity, Serpent, and LLL. They all sucked in their own ways.
* Solidity was primitive--some time before Genesis I personally had discovered that the continue statement was bugged. There was no revert(), only throw (which did the same thing, but burned all gas). Constructors were named by naming a function the same way as the contract that held it. I'm not sure when SafeMath was a thing. Libraries were primitive; none of this using statements thing.
* Serpent was like Vyper, except really bad. I never used it, but Augur did. They commissioned an audit of the compiler, and the report was so bad they rewrote it all in solidity.
* No one used LLL.
* Toolchains did not exist. I remember manually linking contracts in JS. 
* IDE support did not exist. There was mix, a buggy custom IDE which was notable because you could use it to simulate a blockchain. This was great, because...
* ganache did not exist. I remember starting a node on another computer to develop on, because...
* PoA chains didn't exist, either. That other node was PoW mining on its own chain.
* Neither ethers.js or web3.js 1.0 existed. Earlier versions of web3.js were callback based, or in certain horrifying cases synchronous. There were other issues. 
* But let's say you got a functioning dapp. How did you get it to people? It was assumed that swarm would be functional at this point, but as it wasn't, you just had to somehow get the package to someone manually. (I'm not sure if this host-a-dapp-on-a-domain is the best solution here, but it is *a* solution.)
* Of course, neither metamask nor infura existed. You had to run your own node.
* At Genesis there was only geth, cpp-ethereum, and the python one, whose name escapes me. Parity/OpenEthereum came later. At one point there was a Java node. They were all pretty barebones--no fast sync, and definitely no warp sync. Don't even think about a light client.

SwagtimusPrime,"&gt;Great. What's stopping that person from creating a new wallet for new thresholds once they fuck up the other one?

Your funds are locked in the smart contract. No way around it.

I believe you should familiarize yourself with existing DeFi protocols such as MakerDAO, AAVE, and Compound before talking about things you have clearly not understood.

Decentralized ID can be a great thing, I'm not even denying that. But it's not needed for DeFi as it exists right now.",2021-02-24 23:07:27
nikola_j,"Thanks for the tag u/chrisbducky.

The transfer option in DeFi Saver does use the standard transfer function that *is* present in MakerDAO MCD, but not currently exposed in the Oasis app.

When you decide to use it, you should enter your hardware wallet address and the app will handle the rest. (E.g. it will check if that address already has a dsproxy of its own, and if not one will be created for that account (same as when creating the first vault for any account) and the CDP/Vault will be moved over.)

Just make sure you get the right address in there and that's it :)

As a big DeFi early adopter myself, and leading the migration process and reachout, this is very important to me.   
We decided to start off with MakerDAO and AAVE and see where we stand first. But we have reached out to most of the biggest DeFi projects as well, and are seeing how to proceed. We are also working on whitelisting the token on decentralized exchanges, and reviewing legals to see if we can do liquidity provision programs for GLM holders. I cannot promise the latter, as we might get red taped, but DeFi is one of our top priorities.

The stability fee for WBTC-A on MakerDAO is currently 4.5% APR, and you can easily generate yields in excess of this by lending DAI on Compound and Aave.

One of the most powerful tools against miner action is to show that a forked chain will not be supported by the fee generating users of the network. It really is as a simple as that – the more dapps that show support for EIP-1559, the more likely it will pass without (significant) miner contention.

MrMoustacheMan,"&gt;1 DAI = 1 USD (more or less). But why?

&gt;Well, it boils down to incentives and smart contracts. When DAI dips below the peg price, the system makes it attractive for users to close their CDPs by repaying their debts – specifically, because interest rates are raised. This reduces the total DAI supply, as the amount repaid is destroyed. Should the price exceed a dollar, the opposite occurs: users are incentivized to open CDPs as interest rates are lowered. This creates new DAI and increases the total supply.

Another concern is a conflict leading to two or more potential hard forks where none can gain dominance leading to the slow death of the ecosystem. Those are risks for all cryptos though. Major things like government regulation, private chain dominance, competing hard forks, or other concerns apply to all cryptos. I’m not really sure about ETH specific issues.

Competing hard forks are probably even less of a concern for ETH than other cryptos because it’s such a built out ecosystem that major dapps like Uniswap and MakerDAO would likely coordinate and choose one of the forks to support. They depend on ETH so they have vested interest in joining forces to ensure the continued survival of ETH. That fork would then easily gain dominance since the community would follow the dapps.",2021-03-03 03:53:54
ah-hum,"it's possible i'm complicating, but my thought is that to be a part of the greater ecosystem there needs to be maximum exchange potential.  that to me means the concept of liquidity pools where one can lend/borrow safely and securely will increase global adoption and real life use.  borrowing is an important aspect in a world with not enough to go around, and the perpetual cycling of it creates the momentum that keeps us in balance as a global economy.  the other economies that do this well are ecological exchanges, some with a strict purpose, but with the lowest common denominators being the most basic and simple of all.  water, energy, etc.  I can see Nano's simplicity residing in it's adaptability to all scenarios, but I don't think it's wise to convince ourselves simplicity is single-purpose.  That's a major limitation of the beauty of simplicity.  Nano can be the energy of the internet, but borrowing and lending will be a factor (collateralized of course bc indebtedness is a scourge of humanity).

So if Nano was lent on liquidity pools, backed by borrowers' collateral, Nano lenders could earn yields from Nano borrowers.  Accounts in default slowly sell collateral and exchange for Nano which is provided to users (borrower pays exchange premium and fees).  This is Compound app, but replace Dai with Nano.  The protocol is Compound, governed by COMP, and MakerDAO provides the smart contracts for its Dai coin.  Allowing smart contracts in Nano allows new exchanges to happen so it can enter the larger ecosystem.  If it stays single-purposed it will simply be a tool used by those who control finance, energy and machinery.",2021-03-03 04:06:40

The_Roaring_Fork,"Theta 3.0 Mainnet

www.thetatoken.org

Mainnet 3.0 Overview

Building on this foundation, Theta Mainnet 3.0 introduces two protocol innovations:

Upgrading to Elite Edge Nodes will enable “Uptime Mining”, the tokenization of Internet bandwidth and availability. Users will be able to stake TFuel to an edge node to upgrade it to become an Elite Edge Node. Elite Edge Nodes can 1) earn TFuel through their staked TFuel, and 2) earn additional TFuel from video platforms for delivering higher performance. New 2%-4% TFuel inflation for uptime mining for edge nodes will be introduced in addition to the existing 5% TFuel rewards for validators and guardians. In the process of engaging with platform partners this year, it became clear that to support an existing platform that may see over 1 Billion logged in users per month or even a smaller partner with tens of millions of subscribers, requires an edge delivery network that needs to scale to tens and hundreds of thousands of nodes globally to deliver premium service levels, uptime and performance across all devices.

New TFuel burning mechanism will add a cost for using Theta edge network, namely a “network fee” as a balancing force against new TFuel supply. Since Theta network launched two years ago we recognized that there is significant value accrued to video platform partners in the form of content delivery network (CDN) cost savings, increased user engagement, and revenues resulting from shifting infrastructure costs to user rewards. All these benefits accrue to the platform partner at effectively zero additional cost. With Theta 3.0, a minimum of 25% of each TFuel payment to the edge network will be burned at the protocol level, effectively becoming a cost for using the network. In the long-run as Theta’s edge network becomes more widely adopted, this could meaningfully reduce the supply of TFuel.

At the application level, with Turing-complete smart contract support, potentially more temporary sinks for TFuel can be introduced, such as liquidity pools for Uniswap-like AMM DEX, asset collaterals for MakerDAO-like stable currency, etc. With both sources and sinks in place, TFuel circulation can be adjusted dynamically to adapt to actual demand. We believe this can maximize the utility value of TFuel and benefit all stakeholders of the Theta ecosystem.",2021-03-04 06:16:17

The MakerDAO foundation didn't disclose this risk and all UIs just said there's just a 13% penalty if you get liquidated. Running a keeper bot was a mystery and only they knew how to do it due to obfuscated documentation.

They said the system worked as expected and they only restored the MKR supplies at that time. After that, they opened the reimbursement to an on-chain community vote that resulted in pro-compensating the victims. The second vote with how much to compensate was for 0% (probably by MKR whales who have no incentives to compensate CDP users by losing their own money).

itis_so,"DAI is a decentralized Stablecoin from MakerDAO, and has been the essential building block which has allowed DeFi to exist and prosper. It solves the largest problem in crypto-based financial services -- volatility. 

While there are other Stablecoins such as Tether, DAI was the first decentralized stablecoin on a programmatic blockchain platform -- Ethereum. DAI is native to the Ethereum blockchain and is backed 150% by Ether and pegged to the US Dollar.

In my opinion, DAI is a fundamental building block of the DeFi economy running on Ethereum. 

\--

Tether is the oldest stablecoin, first issued in 2014, and still the most liquid in the world. At one point, (data source Coinmetrics) Tether averaged \~hundreds of millions of transactions per day. Tether now transacts on Ethereum as an ERC-20 since 2018 and branched away from the Bitcoin Omni network. 

Tether is not transparent. It's a dollar backed stablecoin, but you cant see where those dollars are held. There are constant issues surrounding banking and it seems that ordinary holders of Tether have always had trouble withdrawing into fiat currencies.

Morkins324,"There are lots of dapps built on Ethereum.

Basically, all of them are protocols built on Ethereum to provide financial services.  They have their own coins to regulate governance of the networks, allowing the people that hold governance tokens to vote on policy and various aspects to govern the protocol, but the underlying dapps largely operate on Ethereum Smart Contracts.  

I think the easiest way to think of it is, governance tokens a bit like ""Stock"" in the dapp ""Company"".  ""Stockholders"" are given voting rights to help define the direction of the company.  As more and more people use the networks, more and more people have a vested interest in the protocol, which means that they are more and more interested in having a say in what the protocol does, which means that more and more people will want to buy ""Stock"" to increase the weight of their votes.  Stock market sort of works a little similarly, as stockholders do generally get the opportunity to vote on major issues (for example, another company made an offer to acquire the company, the stockholders would be given the chance to vote on whether or not they want the acquisition to go through).  So, yes, there are a lot of other coins that are built on Ethereum, but those coins are largely governance tokens for dapps that actually have legitimate financial functions.",2021-03-09 22:04:21

\- If Eth screws up on Eth 2.0 launch or doesn't release Eth 2.0 or gets flipped by BSC or whatever causing Eth price and erc20 coins to crash to 0 then can that cause a protocol failure that can cause Dai to crash to 0 too or corrupt or breach existing running smart contracts at the time?  


\- Does smart contracts have a programmed algorithm in there that automatically protects users from losses if the above happens or can smart contracts detect Eth market collapse like mentioned above? Its called 'Smart' contract for a reason right?  


\- Can buggy code in a running live smart contract be patched up on the fly?  


\- If MakerDao coin crashes to 0 then will this drag down Dai to 0 too?

\- Finally lending out Dai or USDT or USDC for interest on ledger live has no centralized associated risks right like your stable coins being frozen etc? For Dai only risk is De-Fi protocol risk for example buggy code in smart contract yes?",2021-03-10 08:50:03

coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; MakerDAO has released a proposal for an Optimistic DAI Bridge, aiming to serve as a fully decentralized off-ramp for Optimistic rollups. Overlay announced the launch of data stream trading, allowing users to trade against digital asset prices without requiring a counterparty or native assets at stake. Tether has made its way onto Solana as development continues to coalesce around the fast but comparatively centralized blockchain.

ec265,"&gt;The problem with this is they are making eth deflationary by stealing from every single user every time they make a transaction by not passing on the funds to the miners. Literally theft in every single transaction.

Burning ETH is essentially being re-invested in the network. Burning BASEFEE ‘pays’ everyone, equally. Whether you are Staking your ETH, or have it inside of MakerDAO, Uniswap, Augur, in your wallet, in a game, BASEFEE is paid to your ETH. **If you hold ETH, you ‘receive’ BASEFEE indirectly.** ETH price is a function of supply and demand, and this will simply reduce net issuance and potentially overall supply.

&gt;I would argue EIP 1559 is worse than any kind of taxes, since at the very least, taxes are spent somewhere else, no matter how dumb of a place they use them, they're still used.

EIP-1559 *is* Ethereum’s taxation system, and all users are taxed equally. No individual will ever pay more or less in taxes than any other individual, per their use of the network.",2021-03-13 16:49:24

Coldsnap,"Welcome Eth-fam to another **Weekly-ish update** to my high level view of some of the bigger things happening in the Ethereum ecosystem upcoming.

People seem to like this laid out in a timeline, so, may as well keep posting it!

**Timeline impacts this week:**

~ The Eth1/Eth2 Merge was big news this week because people want it sooner. 1 - Vitalik publicly [reaffirmed commitment](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/HkIXJsDmd#Open-discussion) to getting the Merge done as quickly as possible, and 2 - a [WIP PR has been raised](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/2229?s=09) for the Merge in GitHub. Things are definitely happening, so am sticking with the ‘Early 2022’ estimate at this stage although that may now be pessimistic! Consensys has [a good blog this week on the topic of sooner](https://consensys.net/blog/ethereum-2-0/proof-of-stake-is-coming-to-ethereum-sooner-than-we-think/).

~ The Eth2 summer upgrade is now called [Altair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s017DQlsCCw&amp;ab_channel=EthereumFoundation), off the back of the decision to go with star names.

~ Feels like old news but was only last week… at the latest [All Core Devs meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWfR-WxjmYg&amp;ab_channel=EthereumFoundation] it was agreed that EIP-1559 [will be included](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1367858606889037824) in the London upgrade for release this summer. The difficulty bomb delay will also go into London. Still on the roadmap for June. 

~ On the same call it was agreed to [remove EIP-2315](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/263#issuecomment-790910171) from the upcoming Berlin upgrade, which has testing impacts, but they agreed that there would be no change in the dates. Berlin is still happening 14th April all going well. [Official launch announcement comms are out.](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/08/ethereum-berlin-upgrade-announcement/)

**Layer 2 updates&gt;**

~ DeFi app MakerDAO is coming to the L2 party announcing that it has a [DAI/Optimism bridge in the works.](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/announcing-the-optimism-dai-bridge-with-fast-withdrawals/6938
) This will, among other things, make it possible to mitigate one of Optimistic Rollups’ biggest drawbacks, that of the 7 day lockup period required to withdraw from L2. Basically this bridge will allow a loan in DAI to be created to cover the withdrawal immediately. This is pretty huge - have added to the roadmap for Q3.

~ Uniswap’s Hayden Adams has been engaging in a [reasonable amount of bantz on the socials](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1367335215128080384) with regards the hopefully impending Uniswap v3 (to maybe or maybe not include Optimistic Rollups) which should give us confidence, right? Let’s keep it in Q1 for now.

~ Argent this week [posted a great deal of detail](https://www.argent.xyz/blog/layer-2-plans/) around their plans to scale their wallet to L2 using zk rollups. I’d previously had this in the timeline for Q3, and will keep it there, but my read from the post is that this could be even sooner.

~ Immutable X, a L2 scaling solution for NFTs, is [imminently going to start rollout](https://blog.godsunchained.com/2021/03/04/immutable-x-gu-rollout/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=4mar21&amp;utm_campaign=immutable-x&amp;utm_content=imtblx-gu&amp;utm_adID=&amp;refcode=) for Gods Unchained. Looking forward to being able to trade and cheap minting.

~ Synthetix this week added an [improvement proposal](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-117) for L2 synth swaps (ie, the beating heart of the app) on Optimism. I’m adding this to the roadmap to coincide with Synthetix v3 previously announced as roughly Q2.

~ Hermez, a layer 2 solution that has previously announced they are working with Tether, has [released their public testnet](https://blog.hermez.io/hermez-testnet-is-now-public/). This isn’t on the roadmap below, but will put it on if/when Tether scaling is announced.

~ And finally, Rocketpool… clearly now in full FOMO mode, there’s also [juicy gossip](https://discord.com/channels/405159462932971535/405164275036848128/814022039266000897) that other as-yet-publicly-named-teams are integrating with Rocketpool. Audits are still ongoing. The final beta has just been [announced to start next week](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-3-0-beta-finale-fb35c4f8e003). As such, this would indicate early/mid-April for live launch.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;SingularityNET are said to be considering it

It is incorrect to say that SingularityNET is ""considering"" switching to Cardano.  They are 100% committed to moving virtually all of their efforts to Cardano.  They will not be leaving their presence on Ethereum totally, they will allow people to choose where to have their AGI and their vision is multi-chain, although they expect virtually all AGI token holders to migrate to Cardano AGI platform willfully.  SingulartyNET is all but moving away from Ethereum and dedicating nearly 100% of their efforts to building out and deeply integrating with Cardano Blockchain.  Goertzel goes into why in this video.  A lot of it has to do with Haskell and with how Cardano blockchain is structured:

[https://youtu.be/f8JVh1S774k?t=172](https://youtu.be/f8JVh1S774k?t=172)

&gt;SingularityNET's Founder on Cardano: [https://youtu.be/f8JVh1S774k?t=320](https://youtu.be/f8JVh1S774k?t=320) the first infrastructure with the potential to be capable of supporting large-scale decentralized AI systems Ethereum launched something, but it doesn't have the sophistication or scalability of design to support \[the world computer\] vision Cardano with the Plutus smart contracts being released is a much more credible infrastructure for a world computer... a secure privacy preserving democratically governed world computer  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://youtu.be/f8JVh1S774k?t=2856](https://youtu.be/f8JVh1S774k?t=2856) if you have a private chain e.g. if a bank wants to so some blockchain stuff internally, but they also want to interoperate with a public network, then you can have elegant isomorphisims between a Private Cardano network and a Public Cardano Network if you're trying to do that with Ethereum or EOS or something, the mapping of private to public is more awkward and requires more work  
&gt;  
&gt;Haskell language has the ability to set up mathematical mappings between smart contracts in an automatic way A Cardano Haskell program is its own mathematical formalization vs. An Ethereum Solidity program is not (in a useful sense) its own mathematical description. A Haskell program is closer to being its own mathematical description if you need to map between a contract in a private subchain, and a smart contract on a public subchain - those contracts are very close to knowing how to describe themselves to each other, so you can just map between the two in a formal way it's quite elegant you can't build those isomorphisms (structure-preserving mappings) between two Solidity contracts in any practical way isomorphisms = a mathematical term for a structure preserving mapping you can map one contract into another in a way that preserves all the key properties In Cardano's Plutus: you can set up these mappings automatically between smart contracts In Solidity or WebAssembly: you cannot do this CONTRAST WITH WHAT CONSENSYS IS TRYING TO DO WITH ETHEREUM CONTRAST WITH WHAT JP MORGAN WAS TRYING TO DO WITH THEIR OWN BLOCKCHAIN all those things are going to be much nicer with Plutus Financial Services Industry will see that because they're always early-adopters of technology They're also early adopters of AI technology You're going to see a big payoff for Cardano and SingularityNET: as DeFI Mainstreams as DeFI Merges with Traditional Finance then you have large traditional finance organizations that want blockchain inside and they're going to be increasingly dealing with public blockchain markets and they're going to want nice interoperation between them and they're used to software that is less crappy than Ethereum or WebAssembly their software frameworks are not as good as Cardano, but they're better than other blockchains so they don't want to take a step backwards but they will take a step forwards  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://youtu.be/f8JVh1S774k?t=3100](https://youtu.be/f8JVh1S774k?t=3100) This could be what turns Cardano into a 100 billion dollar market cap Cardano is going to become the engine of DeFI Then being the engine of DeFI... when DeFI merges with traditional finance... Then as AI gradually takes over Finance, and Singularity NET is jumping in there Within a few years you can have 10's of trillions of dollars of financial transactions being coordinated by: machine learning algorithms running on a combination of public and private Cardano blockchain if you look at the logic of it, it's something that almost has to happen

&gt;Celsius? Or are they staying with Ethereum?

Celsius is really an independent off-chain service. They are looking into going multichain I believe.  In an interview on the Crypto Crow (youtube) Mashinsky talked about how he's losing millions of dollars every year to pay for the fees on Ethereum, as well as issues with blockchain speed.

correct. AgeUSD is an algorithmic stablecoin launched by ERGO and they will be deploying it on Cardano (perhaps their own/other chains as well).

everynameitryistak3n,"Since you seem to understand that BTC and ETH are the ""safest"" and best plays overall, I'd say the most direct way to increase your stack would be to lock some ETH in a Makerdao vault and use the DAI you borrow to buy more ETH or BTC.

You'll pay currently 4.5% on the DAI debt (plus gas fees in the setup, of course), but as long as you think ETH and/or BTC will go up more than 4.5% (plus the gas fees. Ok, let's say 6% total), then you are better off keeping the loan open.",2021-03-16 06:29:56

jconn93,"You should definitely still be (and stay) skeptical - especially of any new protocols/chains. 

For DeFi in particular, unless you develop expert-level understanding of a particular protocol/product - the best thing to do is use basic heuristics like ""how long has this protocol existed and been securing large sums without anyone getting scammed or the protocol breaking?"". Great examples of ones that have long track records are Compound finance, MakerDAO, Uniswap. Over time, I think the reputations of protocols will sort of naturally evolve to the point that some will be kind of ""blue chip"" that everyday people are familiar and comfortable with. Until then, it's a bit wild west.

Pretty much the whole space is in an ""advanced beta"" release right now and maybe 2-3 months away from being scalable and ready for the mainstream. Ethereum (where almost all NFT live) is rolling out some amazing scaling solutions that have been in the works for years - until that happens NFT trading comes with high fees. Low-value use cases are critical for things like what you describe as ""low-art"", videogame assets etc. Things like the ""ImmutableX"" zkrollup are going to make this possible and completely change the game especially for users who aren't rich art collectors.

You should be **extremely** skeptical of new chains. Right now Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only game in town for things that are truly decentralized, have a long track record and have actual user adoption. There are up and coming competitors to Ethereum (and maybe they'll outcompete and win in the end), but right now these are on a spectrum from ""scam"" to ""awesome computer science project"". I'm inviting a lot of tribalism based attacks for saying this, but hard to avoid this so oh well.",2021-03-17 09:05:42

Liberosist,"March 2021: The Scalability Race heats up. Utterly bananas how rapidly this space is evolving. Just shows innovation can go into overdrive faster than anyone can imagine when the need is dire. 

1st March: Optimism is coming this month! They have won this race!

A week later: Uh, oh, rumblings of a delay. But generalized ZK Rollups are years away, so no worries, Optimism will still win. 

9th March: Matter Labs says generalized zkSync will become said generalized ZK Rollup ""faster than many think"".

10th March: MakerDAO announces Optimism Dai bridge with fast withdrawals. 

16th March: Aztec launches, bringing scalability and privacy to ZK rollups. 

22nd March: StarkWare announces ImmutableX now does \~9,600 TPS and public launch is imminent. Likewise with dYdX. 

23rd March: Uniswap announces they will be on Optimism. 

24th March: StarkWare raises a cool $75 million, three times more than Optimism, presumably to accelerate development of StarkNet, their generalized ZK rollup. Looks like generalized ZK Rollups might just land in 2021, after all. 

25th March: Arbitrum announces they have a release candidate with BLS signature aggregation, commits to a fully public launch. Incidentally, Vitalik was in Optimism discord pushing them to support BLS just a day earlier. 

A few hours later: Optimism confirms the delay, public launch delayed tentatively to July, though whitelisted projects like Uniswap and Synthetix come earlier. 

27th March: Matter Labs drops the mic, generalized rollup zkSync 2.0 is done, public testnet in May 2021, public mainnet July 2021 if all goes well. Might I remind you as early as June 2020 everyone (including Vitalik) thought a generalized ZK Rollup was years away.

Coldsnap,"Right fam, this is the weekly ‘big things upcoming in the ETHosphere’ timeline update. 

For those not familiar we update first on developments this week that have impacted the timeline, then re-state the timeline itself. Post is getting pretty long these days, am *this close* to the reddit charlimit - may need to find a less ephemeral home for it soon, but don’t worry - r/ethfinance always in my &lt;3.

Lots to get into this week, starting with scaling updates:

—

~ Optimism, fresh off having to roll back their ill-fated ‘we’re unilaterally bringing forward our launch date’ announcement due to not first consulting their launch partners about said announcement(!), this week [announced a mainnet launch **delay** to July](https://optimismpbc.medium.com/optimistically-cautious-767a898f90c8)(!!) 2021. You could *feeeel* the collective disappointment in the ETHosphere. Optimism have since returned to their ‘public testnet first’ approach, which should happen towards the end of April, followed by a July mainnet launch. We’ll have to wait until then for that sweet sweet 1000+ TPS. Inb4 disparaging optimism puns said merely-in-jest but not really :/

It’s not all bad, however, as Optimism are still running what they are describing as a closed mainnet whitelist. That is to say that if partners are genuinely ready to launch prior to July, then they can still go live. Optimism are signalling that approx. a dozen projects are pursuing this approach including SNX (already live!), vital tooling-type projects eg oracles, multisig, and token bridges, and…

~ Uniswap hype levels increased this week as they dropped a [fun teaser trailer](https://twitter.com/naturalkapital/status/1374070444039475205) and shortly thereafter [announced their long-awaited plans for Uniswap v3](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3/). This is planned to launch 5th May. Note that v3 is initially without L2 scaling via Optimism, but as above, rollups implementation should be ‘following shortly’ in mid-May, [possibly 12th May according to this source](https://twitter.com/mhonkasalo/status/1374408266118090753) as Uni is one of the whitelisted projects. Uniswap has indicated that there is a significant challenge to create a front end experience that avoids confusion for users when presented with both L1 and L2 DEX options… godspeed UNI UX gurus!

~ Worth mentioning that Synthetix, already live with Phase 0 of their transition to Optimism, confirmed this week that their roadmap towards full L2 remains unchanged, taskwise, but is [taking slightly longer than expected.](https://blog.synthetix.io/oks-update/)

~ One wonders if all of this opens the door to Optimism’s competitors? It’s likely no coincidence that rival rollup solutions, Offchain Labs’ Arbitrum and Matter Labs’ zkSync have both dropped big roadmap updates in the past few days.

Arbitrum [launched their optimistic rollups v4 testnet (their mainnet release candidate) this week](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/arbitrum-updates-buckle-up-80483d71718c). No details yet on how long v4 will run for but I’m guessing mainnet in April until someone tells me otherwise.

Similarly, zk rollups solution zkSync are offering trading of fungible tokens on L2 in April, followed by NFT minting and transfer in May, all on their current 1.x platform. In addition, their all-singing, all-dancing 20k+ TPS zkSync 2.0 platform is planned for public testnet in May, ahead of mainnet launch in August. [Details here.](https://medium.com/matter-labs/zksync-2-0-roadmap-update-zkevm-testnet-in-may-mainnet-in-august-379c66995021)

~ Last week I *rudely*, incorrectly, predicted that long-awaited NFT scaling solution Immutable X would not launch this week. Very happy to have been proven wrong as it has *kind of* launched, I guess? [It’s now possible to link your wallet](https://blog.godsunchained.com/wallet-linking-immutable-x/) to IMX on Gods Unchained. What are you waiting for? I’ll keep it on the timeline as [the next stages](https://blog.godsunchained.com/2021/03/04/immutable-x-gu-rollout/) roll out - Marketplace is next. 

~ And finally, the upcoming Eth1 and Eth2 upgrades - Berlin (April), Altair (June), and London (July) - are all still on track. Solid updates from [Tim](https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/acd/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40timbeiko%2FH1US36qzO) and [Danny](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/24/finalized-no-24/) in addition to the [Eth2 dev call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0EbnFViJFk) this week. Big ticket item for next week will be discussions on the scope of the Shanghai upgrade… to merge or not to merge? It’s worth pointing out that merge proof of concept transactions are [already happening.](https://twitter.com/sigp_io/status/1374979655782989824)

lukemulks,"Hi all, I work at Brave on Brave Ads, contributed to the BAT White Paper, have been a long time member of the team, and wanted to clarify a few of the points in the original post.   


&gt;*Brave’s Ad Network comes with a pretty steep budget that is only targeted at parties who can spend a minimum 15-20k.*

* The minimum spend requirement in our Media Kit, available on our website, is $10K/mo. [https://brave.com/brave-ads/resources/](https://brave.com/brave-ads/resources/)

&gt; *The agency I’m referencing was promoting two crypto products and one privacy related software on Brave. Seems like a pretty solid fit for the Brave community. Their CTR on Brave was around 15% out performing all products including YouTube Ad rolls. Amazing right? Well not when you look at engagement and conversion where Brave actually performed lower than any of the other products. In my neck of the woods this is usually identified as some sort of fraud. So what happened?* 

* The CTR stat included in our materials is 9%, and is a platform average, rounded down. 
* Brave has not released a 15% CTR or higher stat since July of 2019.  https://twitter.com/lukemulks/status/1191380440784887808?s=20 
* Brave released a 14% CTR in Oct 2019, and we've been updating the CTR in our materials quarterly as the platform averages reach more of a steady state as we scale over time. 
* Regarding clickthrough conversion stats: these vary, and simply being a crypto company does not guarantee that you'll have higher conversion rates than a company in another vertical. From our research, \~60% of Brave Ads users are actively using crypto, which often leads to higher scrutiny for crypto advertisers. There are a lot of factors at play with click/view through conversion rates that the platform cannot control (landing page copy, presentation, additional friction in funnel, etc.). There are some crypto products that outperform products in other verticals, including crypto. Others don't. Our audience is growing with Brave.  The key for brands is to test and determine if their products are a good fit with our audience, until we reach a larger scale where the vast majority of verticals have representative cohorts within the platform.   


&gt;*So what explains the extremely high CTR? Well... by opting-in you have the opportunity to earn Cryptocurrency up to a certain cap in USD ($20-30). Many users are under the impression that they will earn more if they click on more ads (They don’t), and this is the cause for really terrible analytics.* 

* The product mentions that rewards are from viewing the ads, not from clicking them. 
* Some users are likely to read past that, but if the problem were as mentioned our CTRs would not be steadying downward, vs the other way around as we scale (Brave 2x'd our user base from Jan 2020 - Jan 2021). 
* We also have users that are opting-in to ads, and while introduced in 2019, the ad model is likely new to a lot of people. 
* Push notification units historically have high engagement rates.   
[https://andrewchen.com/new-data-on-push-notification-ctrs-shows-the-best-apps-perform-4x-better-than-the-worst-heres-why-guest-post/](https://andrewchen.com/new-data-on-push-notification-ctrs-shows-the-best-apps-perform-4x-better-than-the-worst-heres-why-guest-post/)   
[https://www.airship.com/blog/7-mobile-engagement-statistics-that-show-how-push-notifications-boost-roi/](https://www.airship.com/blog/7-mobile-engagement-statistics-that-show-how-push-notifications-boost-roi/)  
*The mobile Ad Fraud is top of the line, desktop could certainly use some work, but overall the platform just doesn’t convert and gives extremely dishonest CTR that’s even being praised in publications. This agency however did buy quite a few of their tokens, not because they want to run anymore campaigns, but to simply dump later because Brave is growing through the roof.*   

* Do you have any links to \*extremely dishonest CTR that's even being praised in publications\*? As stated, our platform wide CTR is 9%. 
* Which agency are you referring to, and where is the evidence to substantiate a claim that they bought a few tokens to dump them later? This appears to be speculation, at best.   


What we're doing at Brave is disruptive to the market - it was when I left my role in Ad Ops / Products to join Brave in 2016, before GDPR was implemented. Brave has always pushed for an advertising and publisher model that operates with privacy by default, and delivers revenue to publishers, advertisers and users. 

Brave has, (always has) and will continue to block 3rd party ad calls and tracking requests. Brave does this, as a privacy product. Brave introduced Brave Ads, which introduces local ad matching on-device (in-browser), and anonymous but accountable event reporting protocols for. The reality is that Brave has had a strong interest in delivering an advertising model that complies with privacy by default, and has brought value to market by introducing that technology (several of the w3c discussions and proposals have referenced our work, and Brave is active in the w3c discussions involving privacy and advertising). 

This is not an effort like others in market that involves whitelisting advertisers for publishers that pay for the privilege. 

The funnel metrics have expanded and evolved over time based on feedback from customers and progress with the technology. Funnel in our media kit linked above, and has evolved to include view/clickthrough conversion reporting, and soon, introduction of the ability to have verifiable order IDs in addition to conversion events. 

Brave created a publisher/creator contribution model (enabled by default when users opt-in to Brave Ads) in advance of introducing Brave Ads, with a verified publisher/creator cohort accepting BAT that has grown to over 1M ([https://brave.com/transparency](https://brave.com/transparency)). We've had an interest, going back to 2016, of introducing a new model that disintermediates, and provides value to users, publishers and advertisers. Ads were still on the roadmap, even in early 2016.

There's no doubt going to be skepticism around our model. There was when we announced what we aimed to do in 2016. There was when we introduced our BAT white paper on ([https://basicattentiontoken.org](https://basicattentiontoken.org)) in 2017, and when we initially brought Brave Ads to market in April 2019. If people weren't skeptical, that would be strange. Disrupting the market is going to be controversial, especially one as large as digital advertising and the attention economy. Our best effort to address skepticism has been to release products that are open source, be open and engaged with the community and our users, and engineer the product to perform and compete in market.   


Just like any other platform, success will vary based on the brand and interest from our growing user base. As our user base has grown from 12M monthly active users (Jan 2020) to 25.4M monthly actives (current) to 50M monthly actives (target for end of 2021), conversion performance is likely to improve across more products and verticals, as they have over time. Brave has performed extremely well for a lot of advertisers, with our renewals being strong month over month. Like most cases, the best way to measure success for any particular brand is to test, learn and iterate.   


Anyway, I hope that this info/context is helpful. We've been delivering an alternative to market. We will continue to deliver alternatives not only with Ads and browsing, but into search and other offerings as well. The crypto space also has evolved from the ""blockchain all the things"" in 2016-18 to actual utility and use with attention, decentralized finance and for other use cases. Our approach is intended to adapt and evolve with the market; BAT began being used in decentralized finance in early 2020 when MakerDAO, Compound Finance, CoinList and [crypto.com](https://crypto.com). That happened organically in secondary markets, and we aim to support those use cases in our roadmap.   


I'm around on Reddit pretty often, and am pretty easy to get ahold of on twitter (@lukemulks) in case anyone feels like dropping me a line with questions.",2021-03-30 02:34:23

Maker was on the Skale ecosystem post ... but aside from that post, I've seen 0 connection between Skale and MakerDAO. Skale has been online for months but I've yet to hear of a single project integrating with it.",2021-03-30 06:12:41
nikola_j,"MakerDAO raised the minimum CDP size a few times over the past months - at the moment you can't create one if you're minting less than 5,000 Dai at that point. Once you have one that has over 5,000 Dai debt, though, you can mint 1 Dai if you'd like, but 5k is the minimum (`dust` parameter as it's called in the Maker protocol).

Creating a Maker CDP (which includes creating the actual CDP, depositing initial collateral and minting Dai) uses about 550k gas (random [example tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xce32124cb8f41b93197bc0fd1773bc421b6926dc6903990bf37c797ca717a01f)).

Creating an instantly leveraged CDP using DeFi Saver uses about 1,2m gas (random [example tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6e18ef8d050f794515de10d5e8070adbf0528f76d9e610033b8deaa25d0f2713)).

Depending on current gas prices, the price in ETH and consequently USD will vary a lot. At 120 Gwei, which seems to be enough for fast right now, that would be 0.066 ETH ($118) and 0.144 ETH ($260) respectively.

Hope that helps :)",2021-03-30 06:18:29
nikola_j,"True, and that's why we already have Reflexer / RAI integrated at DeFi Saver :)

And, additionally, I know that the MakerDAO vision was always that of a multi-collateral protocol, so all is well. Just sorry to see SCD disregarded like that, since we've all loved and used and built on it for so long.

TLDR: PAXG is shady as hell and may soon end up in MakerDAO. Every token in the supply of Paxos Gold $PAXG should be backed by 1 troy ounce of gold and only minted when purchased. This is verified by a Chainlink data oracle.

Over $43,000,000 in difference.

1st March: Optimism is coming this month! They have won this race!

A week later: Uh, oh, rumblings of a delay. But generalized ZK Rollups are years away, so no worries, Optimism will still win.

9th March: Matter Labs says generalized zkSync will become said generalized ZK Rollup ""faster than many think"".

10th March: MakerDAO announces Optimism Dai bridge with fast withdrawals.

16th March: Aztec launches, bringing scalability and privacy to ZK rollups.

22nd March: StarkWare announces ImmutableX now does ~9,600 TPS and public launch is imminent. Likewise with dYdX.

23rd March: Uniswap announces they will be on Optimism.

24th March: StarkWare raises a cool $75 million, three times more than Optimism, presumably to accelerate development of StarkNet, their generalized ZK rollup. Looks like generalized ZK Rollups might just land in 2021, after all.

25th March: Arbitrum announces they have a release candidate with BLS signature aggregation, commits to a fully public launch. Incidentally, Vitalik was in Optimism discord pushing them to support BLS just a day earlier.

A few hours later: Optimism confirms the delay, public launch delayed tentatively to July, though whitelisted projects like Uniswap and Synthetix come earlier.

27th March: Matter Labs drops the mic, generalized rollup zkSync 2.0 is done, public testnet in May 2021, public mainnet July 2021 if all goes well. Might I remind you until recently everyone (including Vitalik) thought a generalized ZK Rollup was years away.",2021-04-02 17:11:33

AusIV,"It's a little complicated.

When you send ETH, you can send ETH and invoke a contract at the same time. That makes it easy to send ETH between contracts and have the contract do something with the ETH that you sent it.

ERC20 tokens don't have that luxury. If you just send an ERC20 token, it gets sent to the contract you're sending it to, but the contract doesn't get to see that you sent it those tokens. If I just call `transfer()` on a token contract, the target receives the tokens, but it doesn't know it received the tokens, and there's not an easy way to establish that they came from me.

So ERC20 tokens came up with a different solution: Allowances. When you ""unlock"" a token, you're giving the target contract permission to withdraw that token from your account. Subsequently, when you make a call to the contract, it can use the allowance you set up to withdraw tokens from your account in the middle of its action (it can verify that you're allowed to do whatever it is you're sending tokens for, pull the tokens, then record that you've paid whatever you were paying for).

Now, there are a number of solutions to this poor UX. Some newer token types have an option to send tokens to a contract and have the token contract call a function on the target on your behalf. The target contract can verify that you permitted the action, and that it received the tokens. But the ERC20 was the first established standard, and there are several competing standards that solve this problem, so approvals are still the most reliable way to achieve this.

Interestingly, DAI has a feature where you can cryptographically sign a message to set approvals *without* having to send it as a message. I've used some sites where you sign a message then make a contract call, the signed message gets included with the contract call, and the allowances get set up in the same transaction as the contract call, which improves the UX a bit and saves on gas. I'm a bit confused why MakerDAO doesn't use that approach in their own applications when I've seen other places that use that model.",2021-04-03 00:49:41
BullToTheMoon,"Kinda. Uniswap and Sushiswap are exchanges. You add money to them and then you collect fees from people like me who would never use Binance or Coinswap as my exchange.  I can convert ETH to DAI, and you get a tiny fee. But when many people use it those fees add up and you get a reasonable return on your investment.

MakerDao, Compound and Aave are lending platforms. People borrow money and if you provide tokens then you collect interest. I've done this too.  I may want to borrow 1,000 DAI then use that to buy more Ethereum. But eventually, I gotta pay back that debt with interest.

I've only personally used MakerDao,Compound, and Uniswap.

MakerDao has the highest fees last I checked so I stopped using it. But they are the ones who create new  DAI, so it's really only worth using them if you have deep pockets.

&amp;#x200B;

omerag,"Not certain I understand the question but I'll give it a shot.

**Buying DAI through an exchange**  
DAI is a stable coin that is minted by MakerDAO. It's pegged (floating) to the US Dollar and its price should always be around $1 US dollar. In this scenario, barring any black swan events, you're pretty safe (as safe as can be in crypto) in knowing this will stay around $1.  
TLDR: No need to worry here  


**Borrowing DAI from Oasis**

You can also borrow DAI. How does this work? You head over to a lending protocol / website like Oasis, AAVE, Compound etc. and can borrow DAI when placing another token as collateral. For example, you can borrow DAI against ETH. Most protocols require an over collateralization of 150%. In this scenario, you need to be watching the price of ETH. If ETHs price is volatile and dips, you can lose your collaterilzation ratio of 150% and get liquidated.  
TLDR: Make sure you maintain the required collateral ratio

Aquinasinsight,"I see, to begin Cardano doesn't have smart contracts and just released it's native tokens. ETH has obviously get those for years already with different variations of naive tokens (erc20, erc223, erc 721).  The ecosystem of ETH, I don't know how many working projects are on there but it's well over one or two hundred. The biggest ones are in the NFT area like open sea and then there is DeFi with things like Uniswap, aave, synthetix, MakerDAO, etc.

Of course, ETH is moving to PoS like ADA started with, but then EIP 1559 is the next change to the monetary policy which will bring deflationary fee burning. Past that there are later two solutions such as Loopring, optimistic roll-ups and MATIC.

On the Enterprise level you have the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA) which is corporate partnerships with ETH. A lot of huge corporations there. Then the recent news of the Office of the comptroller said you can settle payments with banks using stablecoins on the ETH blockchain and visa using ETH and USDC later this year.

This is what people are referencing when they say first mover advantage and it is a very real thing because, ethereum has just had more time to develop these partnerships and relationships.

You can see that already starting to take place with cardano and it's Ethiopia partnership that should be coming out soon.

I think cardano has very good technology and is an aspiring project with a lot of smart minds working on it but it is going to take time for these things and these partnerships to develop, no matter how amazing the technology is this stuff doesn't happen overnight.

That's why earlier I was referring that cardano's real competition is the other smart contract platforms that have been around for a year or two not six years like eth.

Hope that helps answer your question, obviously it would be nice if both succeeded and I think that is very possible that each smart contract platform will capture a different segment of the world.",2021-04-04 07:51:47

Lazy_Physicist,"Risks regarding makerdao:

1. Smart contract risk - this is present for all defi contracts

2. Price risk, if eth crashes youll have one hour to pull your dai out of whatever and repay your loan or add more eth to provide enough collateral. If this happens during a period of high congestion you can expect to pay out the nose for the transaction costs. 

3. The stability rate can and probably will change in the future. It's based off of governance votes and if it changes that will change your overall returns and debt accrual. In the 3 months ive been doing this the eth-A stability rate went from 2.5% to 5.5%

4. There are minimum debt floors (minimum debt for a cdp) depending on the type of cdp you create. If this floor changes due to a governance vote be sure you understand how that affects your ability to mint more dai or payback your debt.

All of that said yes it seems like you've got a good handle on your risk. Fyi youll need to make sure you understand the collateralization ratio and when it will cause you to get liquidated. Personally i maintain a 500% collat ratio just because I'm very risk averse. I figure if the price of eth drops to 500 my plan is to just buy more and add it as collateral rather than pay off my debt.",2021-04-06 00:41:52

**MakerDAO is $2.2 BILLION market cap and $OPEN is $8 million, and $OPEN has an even bigger potential than MakerDAO!**

JizenM,"&gt; Do they sell your collateral?

If the value of your collateral keeps falling then eventually yes.

It will be similar to how MakerDAO works in that you can only borrow a certain percentage of the value of your collateral.

So depending on how volatile your underlying collateral is you may only be able to borrow say 50% - 60% of the value.

**This is still *amazing* in my view because you can use so many things that the banks won't accept as collateral for a loan, including the many different tokens that we love but aren't (yet! 😅) one of the top-3!** 😀",2021-04-06 05:00:38
JizenM,"&gt; I guess it's a long term project.

Yes of course it is. 

This is no different than being one of the first investors in Facebook or Amazon, (or MakerDAO). 

Are you going to worry that Facebook or Amazon may issue more stock and therefore dilute your value? 

At least with $OPEN you can be 100% sure that there will **never** be more than 100 million tokens in circulation, so you can always use the *fully diluted market cap* as the basis of your valuation, if you want to be that conservative.

anarcobanana,How does this relate to MakerDAO?,2021-04-06 13:57:54
da-future-is-bright,"&gt;I don't think I've heard a single person actually explain the fundamentals of the network to me.

Cardano's (reddit) community has nearly quadrupled in size in the last few months, so lots of people still only know the basics (or want NGU) :P

&gt;One thing that I immediately am confused about is why delegation even exists for passive users

Traditional PoS has two shitty options:

1. Run your own validator - Slightly more profitable, but far too difficult for most people to do (well).

2. Stake via an exchange - Convenient, but slowly poisons the network. 

Ethereum fails to cater to the super-majority of potential stakers, because people broadly choose convenience and ignore harmful externalities. The end result will be an unhealthy network.

What if there were a third option?

3. Delegate your stake to community pools - Earn a much better rate with a comparably easy user experience.

Not only does this encourage community engagement and self-custody, but it makes option 1 far more attractive (!!!) since validators can make money from the capital that otherwise would have sat on Binance.

It seems counterintuitive, but allowing the passive users to delegate their stake to others actually improves decentralization. The economic incentives make perfect sense.

Alice's pool may have $100k 'pledged', earning $5k at 5% p/y. That's a nice passive income, but not enough to live on.

What if Alice can get $10m delegated to her pool? Alice takes a 3% fee, and suddenly is earning an extra $15k a year for no extra work (beyond being an engaged community member)

Suddenly Alice can work fewer hours at her regular job, and dedicate more time to growing the ecosystem.

($10m isn't much in a $40 billion ecosystem, let alone a multi-$trillion ecosystem)

&gt;if it has nothing to do with governance. How would those users vote, then?

Naturally, there will be different types of delegation.

People running network infra are not necessarily the best ones to decide on protocol changes or what research gets funded.

So in the end there will be stake delegation (validators) and vote delegation (protocol representatives) and perhaps others.

(there are spending keys, staking keys and voting keys)

Isn't MakerDAO working on delegative governance mechanisms? There is so much common ground between Cardano and Maker, but tribalism still reigns supreme.",2021-04-06 14:10:21

anor_wondo,weren't there some restrictions on using leverage on it? Like needing a lot of capital compared to makerdao,2021-04-06 23:38:07
Coldsnap,"Hello Eth-fam, this is the weekly timeline update. Firstly, an announcement - the kind folks at Ethstaker.cc have offered this post a home! [Check this link](https://ethstaker.cc/category/ethosphere/) if you want to bookmark the timeline and always reference the latest version. I also can expand the post there as am not limited to 10k charas. That being said, I'll keep posting abridged here in r/ethfinance because why not?

I feel that this week seemed relatively quiet compared to last week with what seemed like every project in the L2 space giving insane roadmap updates, both positive and negative. We have some changes/confirmations this week though:

Protocol upgrades - The first of these, Berlin, upcoming on April 14th or 15th depending on your timezone, is on Rinkby testnet and still on track to go live according to [this week’s All Core Devs call](https://youtu.be/V-Qz4UN6Z88). There is a Cat Herders [viewing party](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/ethereum-berlin-upgrade-countdown-community-call-ffa51239c148) for those interested in watching it live with the various EIP authors, as well as a POAP-inclusive [Ethstaker viewing party too.](https://ethstaker.cc/berlin-hardfork-party/)

After that on the Eth1 side we still have the London upgrade scheduled for July. This has EIP-1559 of course and the good news here is that Besu, Geth and Nethermind are already syncing on testnet. The general dev consensus is that London is in a very good place this early on in the timeline. Definitely on track, integration testnet (named Aleut) [spec exists](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/client-integration-testnets/aleut.md).

After London will be Shanghai. The consideration at the moment is twofold… 1- should The Merge go into Shanghai, and 2 - if so, what does that mean for other EIPs in the backlog? If the intent is to deliver ‘minimum viable Merge’ that implies that other EIPs may not get delivered for quite some time (possibly 1 year+). Does that make sense? So there is a big discussion happening at the moment on what, if any, additional EIPs should be being considered for London, Shanghai, and the subsequent upgrade. I’d recommend checking out [the ACD call](https://youtu.be/V-Qz4UN6Z88) for the detail there, or follow [Tim Beiko on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1377980135484260352) u/DCinvestor has also [been posting](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/mho0ic/daily_general_discussion_april_1_2021/gt1lasq/) on this topic seeking community views.

While this discussion progresses, efforts on The Merge are accelerating. [Work towards a locked down spec](https://hackmd.io/@n0ble/ethereum_consensus_upgrade_mainnet_perspective) is going well. Community comms efforts [have started](https://ethmerge.com/). Everybody seems now to want to get it done - but not at the expense of 1559, mind you. Dev consensus seems to be that Merge efforts are in a good place, particularly after the first of the new bi-weekly [Merge dev calls.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3hfgLa_GHw) The only concerns are around client team resource - there is a lot of work compounding, particularly if decisions are taken to load up London and Shanghai with other EIPs. This is very ‘watch this space’. The roadmap will be highly enlightened once the [Rayonism](https://rayonism.io/) hackathon at ETHglobal has taken place April/May. This is where the Eth1 and 2 client teams will be attempting to hack together a testnet Merge and Sharding with rollups if all goes well. Exciting stuff.

In other updates:

~ Coinbase stock listing [now has a date… 14th April](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/coinbase-is-said-to-plan-its-direct-listing-in-two-weeks), same day as Berlin! Is Coinbase really worth $90billion? We’ll see!

~ Rocketpool final beta and audits are still ongoing. I think a more realistic mainnet launch date at this stage is late April or possibly even May if they need to react to audit findings.

~ Immutable X announced that Stage 2 of their roadmap has been [delayed slightly](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodsUnchained/comments/mg7hno/timeline_update_on_immutable_x_integration/), but should still land in April. They’re also planning to [integrate with Opensea](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/100084/opensea-nft-layer-2-immutable-x), which is pretty huge. Date unconfirmed as of yet.

walfsdog,"\&gt; MakerDAO took the covid opportunity to steal millions in ETH from its users and blamed a failure in their liquidation mechanism.

Enticing narrative, but this is just wrong.  The markets tanked on BT and Maker's liquidation system ran out of capitalized keepers that could service the auctions in 10 minutes.  The auction system was an English auction system where the price starts low and goes higher.  There were no keepers liquid enough or capable in the block congestion to challenging 1 wei bids in a 10 minute period, and so much of the collateral was lost for 1 wei of DAI.  This caused Vault holders to loose any possibility of getting part of their collateral back, but impacted MKR holders much more, as this lead to massive losses and dilution of MKR.

It seems like you have some narrative that this was an inside job.  This is a common fault most of us make when evaluating a project failure.  While it's tempting to think this way, because everyone sees the motive and opportunity, the reality is that there is often a much more boring and reasonable explanation.

Maker has spent the better part of a year redesigning its liquidation system to NOT be dependent on keeper liquidity, be more resilient to extreme market events, and leverage single block composability and thus all of DeFi in liquidations.  This amount of effort and direction should tell you what really happened to Maker and Vault holders on BT.  Maker and its users are stronger and more informed for it.  This event also proved that debt auctions, where MKR is minted to recapitalize a loss, work.

This is a DAO success story, not a failure.",2021-04-07 06:58:56

Morais91,"Not dense at all you are somewhat correct! If the overall market debt increases and the minters stay at the same number, they have to cover the debt. This is not likely to happen because it would mean that the whole market is up or that everybody picked the correct stocks, but it can happen. On the opposite side, everytime an investor looses money, the debt gets reduced so minters get more money. 
Like anything, your rewards have risks. In a liquidity pool you earn fees but have the possibility for impermanent loss. MakerDAO allows you to create Daí from ETH and borrow it for a commission, but you risk liquidation fees. In SNX, if you are a minter, you have the risk of having to inject more money, but you earn fees from synthetic purchases and swaps and also get rewarded extra SNX. Also you coleteral (SNX) can always increase in value, which would help cover a possible market debt increase, although the contrary is also possible.

USD Coin(USDC): USDC was helped created by Coinbase and each coin is backed by mixture of cash and short term U.S Treasuries. USDC is regulated by financial institutions.  


Dai: Generated by depositing cryptos as collateral into MakerDao protocol smartcontracts/vaults.

For most people, your purchase experience will not change but the underlying technologies are going blockchain, so you could still use credit card on your toaster as per normal but behind the scene the transaction is happening on the blockchain.

Ethereum has gas, iota doesn't have fees for transaction making it possible for small purchases.

A usd stable coin on iota tangle wouldn't need fees to move around, and to mint stable coins on iota the iota token will be needed to color them.

argbarman2,"&gt;ETH was effectively a BTC clone

100% wrong and totally evident from the whitepaper.

MakerDAO? Original DAO? Augur ICO? Plenty of use cases. I think you mean no real *adoption* until later, which is fair. But buying Ethereum pre-2017 was a speculative bet on what the tech could do in the future, not what was live already. 

&gt;It was shitcoin territory for a very long time. It wasn't really a matter of having faith in the protocol in those days, because there was no credible use case to point to.

By the beginning of 2017, ETH had very clearly distinguished itself from canonical shitcoins like XRP, LTC, XEM, FCT, etc. Definitely safe to say it was in its own class, not as high as BTC but head and shoulders above the rest. 

&gt;The people who bought back then (including me, until I dumped it all in late 2017/early 2018) were just hoping for pump and dumps.

From the perspective of Maker Governance it was resolved when community members put a [plan](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/vault-compensation-plan-v2/3584) together, it was voted on, and it failed to gain the required support to executed. Instead the majority voted that no compensation should be given. 

The reasons for it's failure are open to debate but personally I believe it was a combination of these:  
1. Responsibility for the issue was not clear-cut (see my previous link.)

2. The class action lawsuit was initiated almost immediately.

3. MKR Holders were already diluted once due to the bad debt in the Maker Protocol that resulted from the issue.",2021-04-09 03:55:20

**I see it at between $700 million and $1 Billion market cap within say 2 years if they manage to pull off even part of what they're planning.** This is also assuming that the US government doesn't introduce some atrocious new laws before then, that kills the crypto space.🙄

Just look at MakerDAO for a comparison in terms of market cap.

However, as others have pointed out, it's important to understand that the small market cap today isn't the ***""Fully Diluted Marketcap""*** so over the coming years, (9 years in total I believe) they will release more tokens. 

This will obviously dilute the value of each token to an extent, but since that happens relatively slowly I don't see it as an issue price wise.

teh4rch3r,"What are your thoughts when someone doesn't pay their mortgage and gets their house foreclosed?  Should the bank just give them a refund or return the house?  

Even in the case where your friend had a cdp of 4000ETH, in order to be liquidated they had to have already taken out a loan of at least 2000ETH of DAI (probably much more)!!!  Since they didn't make payments to keep it above the collateral minimum, MKR was forced not just to liquidate, but also mint MKR and sell it to cover the costs.  In traditional finance the exact same thing happens with houses all the time when houses are liquidated (for potentially far under their actual value) in order to cover debt.

Obviously what happened was not an ideal situation for anyone (minting MKR is a last resort), but I'd say MakerDAO has taken the entire situation extremely seriously.

&gt; While the largest stablecoins in the market are currently controlled and issued by centralized entities like Tether or Circle, DAI and its issuer Maker is one stablecoin project that keeps with the ethos of decentralization that the cryptocurrency community is founded on. Due to this mechanism, the rising supply of DAI has coincided with a surge in the total value locked in the Maker protocol which has made the project the second-ranked DeFi protocol behind Compound which has a $9.28 billion TV. As the TVL on MakerDAO steadily climbed alongside the rising supply of DAI, fundamental indicators including increases in social media activity began signalling an approaching price move. As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for MKR climbed into the green on April 12 and reached a high of 80 on April 13, around 31 hours before the price rallied 65%. With altcoins now on the move again and the DeFi sector heating up as evidenced by rising TVL across the ecosystem, MakerDAO could rally further as it is the go-to choice for investors looking to interact with Ethereum network-based DeFi protocols.

MakerDAO is the best one I know of to solve #2.

bwjxjelsbd,"&gt;	ive always wondered why have an oracle based protocol. my guess is that it alot of the code around setting up oracles and having it secure, reliable and tamper proof from malicious actors is taken care of. is there more?

I think decentralized oracle is pretty genius ideas. Crypto industry as a whole is based on doing things in trust less mannner. While having one “official” source of data is much cheaper and easier to do, they don’t have the same security as decentralized way. I guess that’s why cryptocurrency use Oracle instead of just pulling APIs from the source. 

&gt;	The alternative of using smartcontracts on eth like chainlink is to just implement oracles on chain per protocol on eth e.g. makerDaO. Correct me if im wrong but i think marketdao does this with its price feeds for USD and eth.

Yeah, project can do this task on their own too might it’s wasting their resources imo. For example you can grown your own vegetables and raised your own cow if you have farm but that does waste a lot of your time and energy.

ArtyHobo,"No problemo friendo. Just keep up the learns, the more you know the more rabbit holes you become aware of, but also every 1 thing you do learn exponentially makes loads of other things easier.

Example: if you read the white papers for bitcoin, ethereum and MakerDAO, you'd know pretty everything you need to for working knowledge of Blockchain, smart contracts and DeFi.

Binance smart chain is just a centralised copy pasta of the protocols on Ethereum DeFi network. Pancakeswap is just a copypasta of Uniswap for example. MakerDAO is OG DeFi and many of the protocols are built off of this, so understand this one and you basically get CeFi and DeFi.

MajesticQuiet,"Nice. You could even further increase your stablecoin LP's by using freeliquid - a DeFi lending platform. You basically borrow up to 90% of your stablecoin LP's in return for $USDFL (a stablecoin soft pegged to the $ like MakerDAO) and then reinvest the loans in your LP's. ROI increases by 90% and no fees involved.

This could get the numbers up.",2021-04-19 00:42:15
Coldsnap,"Hello Eth-fam. This is the weekly ETHosphere timeline update. Several items checked off of the list made it a pretty significant week. Crypto gained more mainstream acceptance with the Coinbase listing, and the Ethereum blockchain continues its successful run of upgrades since the beacon chain went live last year.

Alternately it could all be nothing... /s

**Protocol updates first:**

~ The Berlin Ethereum protocol upgrade this week was successful! One client, Open Ethereum, experienced a [syncing issue](https://twitter.com/etherscan/status/1382662485832994816?s=20), but this was [quickly fixed](https://github.com/openethereum/openethereum/pull/364). Well done to the Eth1 clients teams for a successful release.

~ All eyes then turn to the next Eth1 upgrade - London, featuring EIP-1559. Development progress is going well with several clients already [successfully syncing](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/client-integration-testnets/aleut.md) to the Aleut devnet. The focus for the next couple of weeks will be the JSON RPC. There is quite a bit of appetite in the teams to get the date for London firmed up. This date was the subject of intense debate on this week’s [All Core Devs call](https://youtu.be/-H8UpqarZ1Y); it is not yet decided which EIPs will be included with London although we know that the difficulty bomb delay alongside [EIP-3198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198), BASEFEE opcode, have made the cut. 3403, 3074, 2537, and 2677 are still being debated. If many more are included it’s likely the date for London will [shift to August](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/245#issuecomment-821329468). This would both give more breathing room to test the changes but also help out The Merge by reducing the number of EIPs that need to be considered in the same breath. Alternately, if there is a need, an upgrade fork could occur in between London and The Merge, but I think this unlikely given how badly people want The Merge to happen ASAP. Basically, it comes down to what MUST be delivered this year vs what can wait 1 year+ for delivery.

~ The Merge testnet will be progressing further at the Rayonism hackathon this week.

**In other timeline updates:**

~ Coinbase IPO happened! Eth2 staking also [went live!](https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-2-0-begins-on-coinbase-canada-approves-3-eth-etfs/) 

~ Rocketpool audits are still ongoing. We are expecting the results of these any day now. In the meantime, the long-awaited [tokenomics article](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-3-3029afb57d4c) finally dropped. Hoping we get some clarity on a mainnet date this week.

**Scaling updates:** 

~ Optimism are also participating in the Ethereum hackathon @ ETHglobal. There is a testnet available for that, which to my mind satisfies the ‘late April’ public testnet milestone in the timeline. 

~ A MakerDAO community call [happened on Tuesday](https://youtu.be/HqALpS93S6k) which focussed on scaling with L2. One of the segments was on the Optimism/DAI bridge and this appears still to be on track - in the timeline for April still in its first stage.

~ ZkSync added some more detail on their plan for ZkSync v2, scheduled to land this summer - this is already in the timeline for August as an estimate. [They posted this week on their novel ZkPorter solution](https://medium.com/matter-labs/zkporter-a-breakthrough-in-l2-scaling-ed5e48842fbf) which, in their view, is a much stronger proposition from a scaling/security perspective than Zk Rollups. Vitalik thinks this criticism is [overblown](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mq2lxd/zkporter_a_breakthrough_in_l2_scaling_matter_labs/gudvo5c/) - some good discussion there.

~ And lastly, now that NFT scaling solution Immutable X has comenced its rollout, they’ve posted an [enticing-looking roadmap](https://www.immutable.com/blog/immutable-x-alpha-trading-launch) that details their plan for wider rollout beyond just Gods Unchained. Unfortunately no dates, but I’ll post them here when known.

Who do you trust most to succesfully keep the peg?


Imo DAI, because that one is vmbacked by its mechanism rather than trust in an institution. But mechanisms can potentially behave unexpected.",2021-04-19 08:17:50
snoo_soulo,"Yes, a stablecoin means 1 stable coin is 1$. This needs to be guaranteed, for the price not to change. The classic way to do that is, start a coin and say 'whoever wants to trade this coin with me for 1 dollar can do that, whenever and however much you want'. 


This way if A wants to sell it, the Max price is 1$, because no one will pay more since they can always buy the coin for 1$ from me.  At the other side if B wants to buy it the price can never be below a dollar, because no one is gonna sell it that cheap, since they can sell to me for a dollar. Now if it were to ever happen that I cannot buy or sell for a dollar, the peg is lost. As soon as that happens, trust is lost and the coin goes to $0. So who of the above institutions is most reliable to always maintain the leg? Depends who you ask. As for how dai does it check makerDAO, they explain it much better then I can.",2021-04-19 08:29:55

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; La transacción es entre particulares, pero el sitio **verifica la identidad** de todos los usuarios y **garantiza** que las dos partes cumplan lo pactado. Por sus servicios cobra el **0,5%** del monto si la venta criptomoneda se hace contra transferencia bancaria y **1%** si es en _cash_.
&gt; 
&gt; Para este tipo de intercambios ""entre pares"" con respaldo otros utilizan la plataforma [Binance](https://www.binance.com/es). Y, con un mecanismo algo diferente, el sitio estadounidense [Airtm](https://www.airtm.com/es/).
&gt; 
&gt; 2\) ""CASAS DE CAMBIO"" DE CRIPTOMONEDAS
&gt; 
&gt; La otra gran opción, quizás más sencilla para los principiantes, es recurrir a las llamadas ""casas de cambio"" digitales que operan en la Argentina. Algunas de ellas son [Ripio](https://www.ripio.com/ar), [Satoshitango](https://www.satoshitango.com/es-AR), [SeSocio](https://www.sesocio.com) y [Buenbit](https://www.buenbit.com).
&gt; 
&gt; Estos _exchanges_, tras registrarse, facilitan una ""billetera"" virtual para recibir las criptomonedas y luego permiten convertirlas a pesos o a dólares a **precio de mercado** (similar al blue) y **al instante**, sin necesidad de conseguir a alguien que justo desee comprar ni esperar a que éste realice un pago.
&gt; 
&gt; En estos sitios, teniendo las criptomonedas ya en la billetera, todo se limita a apretar un **botón de ""vender""**.
&gt; 
&gt; Los pesos o dólares obtenidos se acreditarán enseguida y pueden en el acto ser transferidos a una cuenta bancaria común (CBU) o a una billetera virtual (CVU) como **Mercado Pago**, **Ualá** o **Naranja X**.
&gt; 
&gt; **La operatoria en Buenbit**
&gt; 
&gt; ""La facilidad que ofrecen las plataformas como **Buenbit** es que no se depende de otra persona y el usuario puede vender las criptomonedas al instante, para luego transferir **pesos o dólares** a su cuenta sin pagar ninguna comisión"", explicó a **Clarín** Emiliano Limia, vocero de la firma.
&gt; 
&gt; ""La cotización final de toda la operación puede variar según las **comisiones de red** de cada criptomoneda, las comisiones de la plataforma utilizada (Buenbit no cobra) y la cotización de la criptomoneda con la que se opere"", explicó.
&gt; 
&gt; [Buenbit es una plataforma especializada en transacciones con DAI, el ""dólar digital"". Foto Captura](https://images.clarin.com/collections/static/lazy_square.svg)Buenbit es una plataforma especializada en transacciones con DAI, el ""dólar digital"". Foto Captura
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Este domingo, quien vendía 1 DAI (equivalente a US$ 1) en el sitio podía obtener unos **$ 151,50**. ""Entre _freelancers_ está creciendo el interés y el **volumen del cobro** en cripto"", observó Limia.
&gt; 
&gt; **La operatoria en SeSocio**
&gt; 
&gt; ""Los profesionales que desde Argentina trabajan para el exterior pueden cobrar sus honorarios en criptomonedas a través de **SeSocio**. En 2020 creció esa modalidad, generalmente usando [stablecoins](https://www.clarin.com/servicios/stablecoins-dolares-digitales-cepo-limites-compran-argentina_0_cjuPx7Viq.html)"", indicó a **Clarín** Lucas Marincovich, especialista en Criptomonedas de esa fintech.
&gt; 
&gt; ¿Cómo se hace? Tras registrarse y activar la cuenta, explicaron, se genera una **dirección única** que opera como un CBU, pero para recibir los stablecoins. Ese es el código que se le debe enviar al cliente del exterior para que dirija allí su pago en criptomoneda.
&gt; 
&gt; [Sesocio permite recibir criptomonedas y cambiarlas por pesos o dólares a valor de mercado. Foto Captura](https://images.clarin.com/collections/static/lazy_square.svg)Sesocio permite recibir criptomonedas y cambiarlas por pesos o dólares a valor de mercado. Foto Captura
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Una vez que el _freelancer_ recibe en su cuenta de SeSocio ese pago, ya puede vender esas criptomonedas en la plataforma para obtener pesos a un tipo de cambio ""cercano al valor del dólar **contado con liquidación** del mercado local"", dijeron. Este viernes pagaban **$ 150 por cada ""dólar digital""**.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Las criptos también se pueden **vender en dólares** o usarlas para invertir en proyectos dentro de la plataforma"", sumó Marincovich. Los pesos o los dólares obtenidos, aclararon, se pueden retirar en cualquier momento a una cuenta bancaria tradicional.
&gt; 
&gt; **La operatoria en Satoshitango**
&gt; 
&gt; Muchos _freelancers_ argentinos también utilizan **Satoshitango** para recibir pagos en cualquiera de las criptomonedas que admite esa plataforma (Bitcoin, Ethereum, **DAI, USDC**, Ripple, Litecoin y Bitcoin Cash) y luego convertirlas a moneda local.
&gt; 
&gt; ""En el último año estas operaciones **crecieron un 800%** en la Argentina respecto al año anterior"", reveló a **Clarín** Matias Bari, CEO y cofundador de la plataforma.
&gt; 
&gt; En este caso, el profesional debe estar registrado en [www.satoshitango.com](https://www.satoshitango.com) y facilitarle su dirección única a quien le transfiere las criptomonedas, que también **deberá ser usuario** del sitio. ""La transferencia es **sin costo** y se realiza de inmediato"", aseguró Bari.
&gt; 
&gt; Este viernes, en la plataforma, pagaban algo más de **$ 153 por 1 DAI o 1 USDC**, las criptomonedas estables que siempre valen prácticamente lo mismo que **US$ 1**.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ## ¿Qué pasa si el cliente del exterior no quiere pagar en criptomonedas?
&gt; 
&gt; En los países donde más se suele demandar el trabajo de los **freelancers** argentinos, como Estados Unidos y muchos de Europa, usar dólares y euros para comprar criptomonedas es legal y se ha vuelto común.
&gt; 
&gt; Tanto que muchas empresas hoy ofrecen abonar en criptomonedas los trabajos que tercerizan en _freelancers_ de todo el mundo.
&gt; 
&gt; Lo hacen para **reducir costos** y para **facilitar el cobro** en países con duras restricciones cambiarias, como Argentina y Venezuela.
&gt; 
&gt; De todos modos, ante un empleador que sólo ofrece pagar en dólar, euro o similares, lo que hacen algunos _freelancers_ hacen es:
&gt; 
&gt; - Abrir en el extranjero una cuenta bancaria o una billetera virtual (como Paypal) y recibir allí los honorarios en dólares.
&gt; - Convertir los dólares a una criptomoneda estable en una ""casa de cambio digital"" de ese mismo país, como puede ser [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/es) en Estados Unidos.
&gt; - Vender los criptoactivos en la Argentina por pesos o dólares en una plataforma P2P o una ""casa de cambio"" digital local.
&gt; 
&gt; El problema de esta opción es que, según especialistas, puede traer **problemas legales**.
&gt; 
&gt; [Los que trabajan desde Argentina para el exterior buscan alternativas para que sus ingresos les rindan más.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ## La legalidad de la maniobra y su aspecto impositivo
&gt; 
&gt; Ahora bien, ¿cómo es la convivencia entre este creciente fenómeno y las leyes argentinas respecto de cómo debería realizarse un cobro a un cliente del exterior?
&gt; 
&gt; José Luis Ceteri, especialista en temas tributarios, explicó a **Clarín** que la normativa de referencia es la que regula las **exportaciones de servicios**. ""Ya sean monotributistas o estén en el régimen general, los _freelancers_ tienen que hacer una **factura E** -de exportación- al cobrar sus ventas"", detalló.
&gt; 
&gt; Y amplió: ""Ese ingreso está exento de IVA y de Ingresos Brutos. Pero las divisas obtenidas **deben liquidarse** (venderse por pesos). Y deben pagar un **5% de retención**, salvo que el contribuyente esté registrado en la AFIP como micro o pequeña empresa, y siempre que no haya exportado más de US$ 600 mil el año anterior"".
&gt; 
&gt; Según Florencia Fernández Sabella, especialista en Tributación, hoy lo problemático de todo esto es que los dólares ganados en el exterior deben rápidamente ""liquidarse en pesos en Argentina a través del Mercado Único y Libre de Cambios (MULC), al tipo de **cambio oficial**"". Es decir, a menos de **$ 93** por dólar.
&gt; 
&gt; Ahora bien, ¿qué pasa si lo que se cobró afuera no fueron estrictamente dólares, sino **criptomonedas que equivalen** a dólares? Ahí las cosas ya no son tan claras porque la legislación no fue hecha previendo algo así.

The cool thing is that it’s not a coin that promises something later, it’s doing what it’s supposed to do now. You can get a loan of Dai on certain cryptocurrencies right now, and then get cash for your Dai. You can also buy Dai, which is what it creates, and it’s historically done a good job of staying pegged to the dollar. Assuming that crypto continues to become more popular, people will resist selling for a taxable transaction and take out a loan. That is done through the MakerDao smart contract with a vault. Anyway, really cool and with MKR, you can be part of the governance of it. It’s riskier than BTC or ETH, but I like it.",2021-04-22 02:58:06

FidelHimself,"I'm glad you asked because this is my favorite subject. Pretty complex in details but the big picture is simple. 

This summer a bunch of Web3 orgs were created known as Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). For example, MakerDAO which take ETH (cryptocurrency) as collateral and issues loans in digital dollars (DAI) which keep the value of $1. This is money that can be invested or even used to buy a home, while the underlying asset (ETH) does not need to be sold. 

The DAO is permissionless so even a 12 year old could use it if they knew how. The DAO is run by those who own a stake but there is no location for the organization; it is native to the internet. When people interact with the Maker protocol but it is non-custodial which means the ""customer"" keeps custody of his tokens, there are only smart contracts and no human middle-men. The code is open-source and can be audited for bugs or exploits -- compare that with traditional government bodies.

I can go on about the benefits of this model but these are the key points. There are many other DAOs with their own goals and communities. They can be the governing body of a virtual world, an NFT art trading platform, or a gambling site.

In the physical world we have volunteer local governance models like Homeowner's Associations that take fees to act collectively. They mow community land, maintain fences and other basics like fountains or small parks. Sometimes they collectively pay for security. 

**I'm proposing we combine HOAs and DAOs to replace current coercive governments, one department at a time.** 

We don't need politicians to act as middle men anymore. 

**We can decentralize every service and let different models compete withing the same geographical area.** Think about how much conflict would be solved if we didn't all have to live under the same federal structure. You could theoretically live next to a socialist and a capitalist without them imposing their preferred system on the other by coercive measures.

One final point is that this is not ""all or nothing"". Everyone would have to agree that we respect the natural rights of those not affiliate with our community. Beyond that, every single policy could be it's own contract. 

The entire constitution could be one contract with many subcontracts. The difference is that every citizens would explicitly sign these contracts instead of just some old guys (supposedly) back int he 18th century.",2021-04-23 06:07:24

&gt; Now MakerDAO is paving the way for what might become another source of growth in the now-$60 billion DeFi industry: lending against trillions of dollars of real world assets including residential properties, in competition with banks and other financiers. The MKR token's price surged above $4,000 on Wednesday for the first time as members of the MakerDAO community - the decentralized organization that governs the project - passed an executive vote to allow an ERC-20 token representing an ownership stake in a pool of real estate assets as collateral. During the ""Black Thursday"" sell-off in cryptocurrency markets in March 2020, a sharp drop in the price of ether, the dominant cryptocurrency used as collateral in Maker for collateralizing dai loans, forced the protocol to issue new maker tokens into the market.

CrushHazard,"People think of Bitcoin when they think of crypto, but it’s much more than that. 

The Stellar network is being heavily used to make cross border payments and currency conversions. 

Orchid is a decentralized VPN. 

Augur uses its token to power prediction networks. 

But the most exciting stuff going on is in DeFi platforms like MakerDAO. It uses a currency called DAI, which is pegged to the value of a dollar. Essentially, your financial transaction (which could be just about anything — a house purchase, a bond issuance, a crowdfunded secured loan....) is reviewed, monitored and verified by hundreds of real life users called Oracles instead of a centralized entity like a bank. You always pay market price for your transaction instead of dealing with the banking oligopoly. 

There is so much efficiency that can be gained by circumventing traditional finance, which has truly become a scam lately. Think about it. In the old days, the bank paid you to hold your money. Now, you pay them. And they will tell you that it’s all about security, but how secure have these entities been? What are you really paying for? Something of value, or just the fact that you have nowhere else to go, thanks to regulatory capture?

ec265,"MakerDAO is the OG and so I will use that as an example.

You provide ETH as collateral and can then drawdown DAI. These loans are over collateralised (150%), meaning you can borrow up to 66% of the value of your ETH. This means that the borrower can never default, as in the event the ETH price falls, the ETH that is held as collateral will be sold. 

You can draw and repay DAI at any given point, there is no repayment schedule (but you will need to consider your collateralisation ratio and may have to repay to maintain this). This is why it’s truly permissionless - you are in control and all you need is a wallet and some ETH.",2021-04-24 02:09:25

I was studying the AI side of this coin, and it's pretty incredible what's it's programmed to do—essentially it burns the coins to drive up the demand/ value. One writer/ researcher in the DAO forum said, ""Burning off Dai controls the supply of Dai thus stabilizing the price. Burning off MKR counteracts the minting of new MKR being created and reduces the supply thus increasing MKR’s value for token holders.""

T2000-TT,"For people who don't know what atomic composability is, it is the ability to instantly commit a transaction across multiple shards at the same time in a single step. This is in contrast to non-atomic composability where a transaction goes through on one shard first and then other shards later or cross shard transactions take multiple blocks to process. Non atomic composability is really inefficient and completely breaks a lot of apps, things like flash loans and apps like yearn and MakerDAO stop working properly across shards without atomic composability and even apps like Uniswap can experience problems.
By providing atomic composability and Unlimited scalability Radix is the only project that will be able to scale DeFi indefinitely into the future without issues.


Radix makes dapp building much easier too, dapps are built out of FSM components which are more secure than solidity smart contracts, easier to build and easier to learn for traditional web devs crossing over into the world of decentralised apps. App developers who build useful components on Radix will receive lifetime royalties whenever their component is used, encouraging the growth of the Radix ecosystem and rewarding devs for making valuable contributions.
Right now the project is sitting at a marketcap of 170M, this is nothing for a project that is solving such huge problems and has this level of technology.
If the tech wasn't enough, Radix is about to release their Betanet a week from today and Mainnet in June. It is early now but momentum is building up now and after seeing what recently happened with Solana I don't think it will remain undervalued for much longer.

TLDR
- Unlimited scalability, very fast, cheap fees
- The only platform where apps don't lose performance with sharding
- Easy to build apps on
- Lower risk of smart contract exploits
- Great developer incentive program (lifetime rewards)
- Betanet in 1 week, Mainnet in June
- 170M marketcap
Radix has real potential to be a top 10 project.",2021-04-25 00:44:31

They are still working on their smart contract layer. Their functional UTXO-based smart contracts launch in August.

Then they have to rewrite all of the DeFi contract systems they want in that functional UTXO-based system - if they want clones of things like Uniswap, MakerDAO, etc. they have to re-architect it from the ground up. Then they get to write a new rollup system, again from the ground up because it needs to be written in a functional language for a UTXO-based system.

If they put teams on all of that and it all happens in parallel, you're still looking at 2 years out at LEAST until they have DeFi running on rollups, and that's being very generous. My guess would be closer to 3 years for launch, 4-5 to gather liquidity and reach maturity.

So yes, Cardano can theoretically implement rollups, but I can tell you it won't happen for a long time. This isn't wishy washy fud like ""Ethereum 2.0 will never launch"" either, I believe it would actually take them at least 3 years of real development time, even if they know exactly what kind of system design they are building, to have anything close to Ethereum's DeFi rollups.",2021-04-25 04:56:35

3. You could probably work for any of the major DeFi DAOs/Companies as either a consultant or on staff. MakerDAO actively supports research grants. FTX probably has a host of jobs you would fit into. Also Coinbase is likely moving to becoming a decentralized finance bank, and definitely comes to mind as a place for tons of jobs. Another one I know of is UMA that is actively funding grants for projects.

Once smart contracts go live, devs will have to re-write DeFi, products like MakerDAO, Uniswap, etc. under a functional software paradigm for a UTXO system, no copying code because the architectures are so different and Cardano handles contract shared state in a completely different way.

Once smart contracts are launched, Cardano starts where Ethereum was in 2016, newly supporting smart contract token systems and starting to build DeFi from the ground up on layer 1. Meanwhile, ethereum will have launched rollups and scaled on an evm-compatible layer 2.

If anything the number of positions that was automated at that moment kept the overall Maker protocol from going into much more negative debt. There was about 7,5m Dai of debt paid back by the system on behalf of users on Black Thursday and that was at a moment where there was 100-150m Dai in total, so quite a noticeable amount.

Either way, I wish they did figure out a reimbursment plan of any kind for everyone affected by 0 bids on that day, but unfortunately it never came to be.",2021-04-25 18:12:29

Our Automation services are also trustless with all user parameters and permissions being fully on-chain, with the off-chain elements being our DFS bots that track positions and send out the needed transactions. Some more info on how it works is available in our audit report [post](https://medium.com/defi-saver/defi-saver-automation-security-audit-summary-a883d4fde1b) and I'll gladly provide any more info on anything, of course.",2021-04-25 18:27:57
nikola_j,"Boost and Repay are leverage management actions, where Boost borrows more to buy more of the target asset and increase your exposure, and Repay takes out and sells part of the collateral to reduce exposure and risk (or you can do a full Repay if you're set to close a leveraged position fully).

These can be used manually whenever wanted, Boost and Repay are available in all our dashboards (for Maker, Compound, Aave1+2 and Reflexer) and you can chose to run either of those at any point you want.

And then Automation is an add-on service where you can configure auto-Boosting and auto-Repaying based on wanted parameters.

There are two ways you could use Automation - either for liquidation protection or for automated leverage management.

In case of auto-leverage management, you can use this tool to simulate what would happen over certain simulated periods - [https://defiexplore.com/simulation](https://defiexplore.com/simulation)

The Automation system is pretty basic right now, and it can either increase leverage when market goes in your position's direction, or decrease when it goes the opposite. For example, if you create a leveraged CDP at MakerDAO in April 2020 and had it automated, it would have been buying up more ETH as it kept going up, which would overall result in you having a noticeably higher ETH balance to potentially close to today.

Thought, you could both long or short assets at DeFi Saver, so you could also automated a short position (though those are only doable in Compound and Aave, not in Maker). If needed, [here's a post](https://medium.com/defi-saver/how-to-long-or-short-any-asset-using-defi-lending-protocols-812300c9a640) on longing and shorting assets using DeFi lending protocols.",2021-04-25 18:42:25

While these are currently only available for manual usage and don't have that many protocols supported, this is something that we just released and that we aim to greatly expand on in the next months and, really, throughout this whole year.

And then we also have plans to add automation support, where you could for example configure an automatic action ""if the c-ratio of my vault #3421 falls below 180%, withdraw Dai from Yearn and pay back vault debt"". 

Also:

&gt;I'm aware of defisaver and it's great but it only works with stables in your wallet, not in a farm. 

This isn't really how currently available Automation for MakerDAO at DeFi Saver works - it never uses Dai from your account. It actually unwinds part of your position to pay off debt, meaning that it takes as much ETH (or whichever collateralized asset) needed to sell for Dai for debt payback to reach your set target ratio.

The aUSD will be the stable coin in the Acala Network.
Acala itself is so much more - Automated Marked Maker (AMM), a full Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and will provide a lot of DeFi utility with the Acala EVM alone.
The Acala Token (ACA) will be some sort of governance/utility token which i would compare to MakerDAO for beginners to better understand, although they are for sure not the same.

There is a lot to learn about the project, here is a good [link explaining the ecosystem without getting too complicated](https://academy.ivanontech.com/blog/what-is-acala-and-the-aca-token)

You should also read about Karura - its basically the same on the Kusama network.
Since Kusama has a lower trust level and will be also faster - Karura (KAR is the token token) i would explain it as Acala on Steroids, lets see how that works out!

This HODL idea is more like ""I have these tokens in DeFi, but I've pledged them to this lender to be paid back over time"".

It would basically be a collateralized loan where you make profit on the underlying. You could initiate the contract with a lender address who is allowed to withdraw a certain amount every month.

Jayeluu1129,"/u/longforwisdom has  the correct answer. The DAI price could spike if there was a mass selloff of Ether or something, in which case demand for DAI would increase in the short term as people try to cover their positions. But DAI spiking wouldn't put you at risk of being liquidated, only a decrease in price of the collateralized asset would.

This happened on Black Thursday in March 2020, I think DAI hit $1.23 at the time. Barring any more black swan events, something like that hopefully won't happen again. 

400% isn't a bad place to start, and glad to hear you have additional Ether to throw in in case of emergency. Yield farming with funds effectively minted from MakerDAO does have risks though, as I'm sure you're aware. Lending rates have generally remained above 10%, depending on the platform, but if MKR governors decide to increase stability fee and/or lending rates start to fall, you obviously risk then losing money.

Please note I didn't say the company was run by AI nor that I'm aware of any that are, what I'm talking about is strictly DAOs which are decentralized autonomous organizations. 

Running a DAO means you've deployed a smart contract (application) to a blockchain with an execution layer like on Ethereum. This application has a number of functions determined by it's programming. Once this application has been deployed, it will live on the blockchain forever, and at any point you can contract a function from the application if you follow its rules. 

The management of this application happens via voting on proposals by MakerDAO token holders. In this specific example the company still has an official CEO, CTO, COO, developers, etc. The crucial difference is that control of the company is in the hands of the shareholders. The shareholders, who are holders the MKR token (like a digital stock with voting rights) can be anonymous and spread all across the globe, but they are the ones who decide which proposals pass and which do not. Anyone can make a proposal and put it to a vote, and then the official implementation is managed by the company. 

In the case of MakerDAO their product is a stable currency called DAI, a digital token that follows the value of the USD. Users can mint DAI from the MakerDAO smart contract by making a deposit of some underlying collateral, like ETH or wrapped BTC or real world assets. Basically it's like a decentralized bank that allows you to take out a loan with something you own put up as security. To release your collateral you must pay back the amount of DAI you owe. If your underlying collateral starts losing value to the point where there's a chance your debt position becomes undercollateralized, either you must supply more collateral, or your underlying collateral is auctioned off on the market.

It's not just ""a company that holds no personal, physical resources, while the only resource that it controls is produced on an at-home basis"". I never said it was and you could have looked it up yourself if you actually cared to know.",2021-04-28 03:06:23
ethacct,"yep!  MakerDAO vault -&gt; DAI loan.  Deposit DAI into yield farm (aave, harvest, yearn, etc.) to make more money.  When you're done, collect your yield then take your original DAI back to pay off your MakerDAO debt and return your ETH.  I'm doing this right now, actually.

Things to be aware of:

1. If the price of ETH drops considerably, you will have to pay back your debt sooner (since it is collateral if the price of your collateral falls it may not be enough to cover your outstanding debt)

2. make sure the yield you're farming is higher than the interest you're paying on the Maker loan (currently 5.5% per year but it can change)

3. gas costs are currently expensive on ethereum.  this will change in the future but for right now it's not really profitable to do it with less than 5 figures USD.",2021-04-28 03:32:56

The head of Banco Santander's blockchain lab in Madrid, recently touted the potential for increased decentralized ledger technology adoption in mainstream finance.

While acknowledging that current public blockchain networks might not be optimized for high-frequency transactions, Whelan highlighted their suitability for settlements in the financial services arena.

""Settlement is not something that has to happen instantaneously,"" Whelan stated, adding: ""Usually in the financial market, settlement is T+5 - we agree on a trade and we wait five days for settlement.""

Earlier in April, Rune Christensen, CEO of decentralized finance unicorn MakerDAO, stated that DeFi will require regulatory clarity to move from its current isolated bubble phase toward more significant interfacing with mainstream finance.

Whelan also touched on the recent announcement that Banco Santander was one of three financial institutions selected by the European Investment Bank to issue a two-year 100-million-euro ($120 million) digital bond.
According to the bank executive, the legal record of ownership is domiciled entirely on the public Ethereum blockchain.

augustofretes,"My experience with rollups is that they solve one problem (low tx/s) and replace with a bunch:

* No more composability. The system is entirely broken into independent silos, with essentially independent funds. If you're on Loopring, you can't interact with MakerDao, try new lending protocolos like Liquity, or even buy all that many tokens (you can't even send funds to an L1 address without withdrawing them first). Interacting with any other L1 contact requires you to whitdraw from Loopring to L1, then if the contract you want to interact with exists on a different L2, you need to deposit to that L2. L2 bridges will make this easier from a a user's perspective, but the underlying issue is still there.

* L2s are not censorship resistant, and the L2 owner can refuse to do what you want. This is true even in advanced zk-rollups like Loopring's. L2 solutions are just not really decentralized, best-in-class rollups ensure that your funds can't be stolen, but that's about it. 

* Future Ethereum solutions like sharding won't run the EVM, so they don't scale the capacity to run smart contracts as much as looking at the raw number of tx/s suggests. 

* Side chains (really independent chains), don't rely on Ethereum for security, and are really independent beasts with their own pros and cons. You can't recreate the entire history on chain using Polygon, so if the Polygon was compromised in some way, or shut off, there's no way for you to move your funds back to the Ethereum network. In essence, you need to trust Polygon, not Ethereum to use it.",2021-05-01 02:19:20
Neophyte-,"thanks thats a great answer

&gt; There is actually not a real problem with the UTXO model, in fact, it is better in many ways and enables critical solutions to some of the issues the blockchain industry faces today. 

my thought about the utxo model potentially breaking down in hard cap blockchains was constant dividing of utxo into smaller and smaller chunks leading to tx bloat. is that not the case? if so why not?

&gt; Because of the parallelism we get from UTXO processing, which isn't available on an account based system, we have solved the miner extracted value issues in DeFi as well as front running, since all currency conversions in a single block are processed simultaneously with all others, resulting in all participants in that block getting the same conversion rates in all directions with no spread.

can you expand on what that means? i thought defi had nothing to do with miners, just people mostly loaning/ borrowing money where loans are collateralised in smart contracts. there are other cases like makerdao and liqudiity mining LP tokens.

&gt; will allow anyone to create their own connected blockchains, launch currencies with kickstarter-like fund-or-refund blockchain participation that have their own bandwidth, their own ability to issue IDs, their own independence, in-spite of interoperability with the rest of the Verus network (and others including ETH), and can be automatically discovered, connected to and merge-mined by anyone on the network

Gladfire,"&gt; DARPA funded the research 

DARPA is the most well known reasearch agency of the USDoD.  


&gt; It was really the university network that drove adoption. 

When developing non-sensitive technologies the DoD historically always works closely with the universities then allows usage of the tech.  


&gt; I *am* sure that the military never used public networks for their communication in those early days. 

The military funded it's development for their own eventual usage, ARPANET wasn't used by the military to my knowledge, it was the proof of concept.  


&gt; I assume you mean $1.5 MM or something? 

Yeah, typo. Fixed.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; So no, it doesn't put control back in the hands of the banks--exactly the opposite. 

If there's a high cost for entry, banks and financial institutions can leverage their vastly higher resources to gain controlling stakes effectively, no?  


&gt; Enough demand might incentivize new entrants into the GPU market, which would be a huge boon to everybody. 

And in the mean time the average consumer will be priced out of the market completely.  


&gt;You threw an environmental argument in there, too. But you can use that argument against basically *anything*. In fact...if we have limited resources to create GPUs, would they be better spent creating a new, public, distributed financial system available to everyone in the world, or helping first-world gamers get from 90 FPS to 110 FPS in their video games?

You're implying that this is a case of either or, if regular consumers didn't buy these, they wouldn't be made, you're implying that the alternative is a new financial system which doesn't currently exist. You're also making green = no happiness argument, we're talking minimization with minimal impact on QoL, not utter minimisation, no one's suggesting to send humanity back to the stone age.  


&gt;  But it's not *entirely under the control* of government. 

You're implying that any direct influence by companies is beneficial, it isn't. Companies want what is best for companies, governments want, or at least pretend to want what they, at least pretend, is best for their people.  


&gt; You're half-right. It is pinned to the USD, but it's not controlled by a company. 

In terms of financial markets, companies, banks, and other financial institutions controls significantly more capital than regular investors. DAI is voted through MakerDAO, and the amount of DAI you put into you vote controls the weight of your vote, no? Now, either the groups with more capital can take over and do what they collectively want and so you're controlled by the company, or they can't do this and the currency is at the whims of a company, namely whoever are the executives of MakerDAO.  


&gt; You think Microsoft is going to...*buy* Bitcoin or something? 

If cryptos become recognised, global currencies, then companies are indeed going to work together to buy them and gain control where ever they can.  


&gt;Historically that hasn't worked; the best they could do was fork it (BCH &amp; BTG). And with the market cap growing quickly, it's becoming less feasible by the day. 

Historically, these attempts have been done by relatively small groups with little capital compared to multi-trillion dollar companies, or countries.",2021-05-01 04:52:09

thanks i didnt realise this, hence the blockchain bloat isnt really a problem.

on point 2) ive read that the UTXO model makes writing smart contracts more difficult since you need to pick out the UTXO you need to fulfil the transaction e.g. sending some money. in the account model its easier since you just deduct the balance. Do you think thats a valid criticism? or can the contract framework hide those lower level details from the user, much like how bitcoin wallet software works?

And more info about Zilswap and other growth to their ecosystem in their latest growth report here: https://docs.zilliqa.com/ecosystem-growth-report-2021-Q1.pdf

Zilliqa will have another dapp released soon called Pillar Protocol which is similar to MakerDao on Ethereum.

Another exciting item is Zilliqa will have a bridge between Zilliqa and other blockchains in Q2 sometime so other tokens such as ETH will be available to be wrapped and used on Zilliqa chain.

Also, they’ve had a recent partnership with Polaris sports which works with some high profile sports stars like James Rodriguez and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Another major partnership is Xfers which is considered the PayPal of Southeast Asia and is they’re partnered with PayPal, Gemini and Coinbase. Zilliqa created a stable coin used on the Zilliqa chain for Xfers.

Zilliqa has a partnership with Mindshare and did some test pilots with PepsiCo for some campaigns. Relevant info here: https://www.mindshareworld.com/news/mindshare-to-launch-first-phase-of-blockchain-pilot-on-the-zilliqa-platform/

Coldsnap,"Hello Eth-fam! Quick one for the ETHosphere timeline update this week as it’s a holiday weekend for me here in the UK. Taking some time out to relax, and of course watching the price spike like the rest of you degens. The summary of this week is that we don’t have much new, but we do have much more confidence in the Merge and the London upgrade is still on track. I think the market is reacting to something…

**The Merge**

~ On Friday, the first Merge devnet was activated at the Rayonism hackathon. Four Eth2/consensus layer clients (Teku, Prysm, Lighthouse, and Nimbus) achieved various levels of interoperability with three Eth1/execution layer clients (Besu, Nethermind and Geth). Things are looking good for testing so far.

~ It looks like there **will** be an effort made to test sharding and withdrawals, although u/vbuterin [points out](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n1cpbh/tutorial_for_ethereum_merge_testnet/gwc6nmd/) that this test is for the post-transition state of the Merge only - the transition itself is a separate, hopefully simpler, beast that will be informed by the learnings we get from Rayonism. 

~ All told this is incredibly bullish. 2021 Merge launch ambition is looking more likely as a result of this, in my view.

**London**

~ Still on track for 14 July. We should find out the specific block numbers for test/mainnet next week.

~ EIP-3529, for reducing gas refunds, is the new EIP-3403. 3529 [will be included](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1388193584726233091) in London.

~ The difficulty bomb EIP, 3238, needs to be re-written to accommodate the change to bring it forward to Dec 2021. Thus 3238 will not be in London, but its eventual replacement will be.

~ EIP-3541 [is also being considered](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/307) for inclusion in London. If included, 3540 should follow in Shanghai. If not, it might be Cancun which is gonna be a while. To be discussed at [the next ACD](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/309)!

~ Due to these EIP updates, the [Baikal devnet has been launched](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/client-integration-testnets/baikal.md), replacing the Aleut devnet. We hardy knew ye!

**Other bits**

~ Rocketpool - The current (finale?) beta has now concluded! A new more permanent Rocketpool testnet will launch on the Prater testnet in May. This is effectively the mainnet release candidate for Rocketpool and will include updates off the back of the audit recommendations. I feel like we say this every week, but, mainnet edges closer! Am still picking June until they tell me otherwise.

~ Uniswap v3 lands this week, Wednesday! Remember that it’s not planned to launch on Optimism L2 - that is still to come. All eyes…

~ And those are the main timeline updates. Not much change in the L2 landscape this week afaik, but some weeks are like that!

TonberryHS,"A “stablecoin” is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tied to an outside asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold, to stabilize the price.

**Tether**

Tether, or USDT (-0.01%), is one of the oldest stablecoins, launched in 2014, and is the most popular to this day. It’s currently one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies overall by market capitalization.

The primary use case for USDT is moving money between exchanges quickly to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities when the price of cryptocurrencies differs on two exchanges; traders can make money on this discrepancy. But it has found other applications: Chinese importers stationed in Russia have also used USDT to send millions of dollars worth of value across the border, bypassing strict capital controls in China.

Tether Ltd., the company that issues USDT, is embroiled in a legal battle with the New York Attorney General concerning providing financial documents that would illuminate its financial relationship with the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex.

**USD Coin**

Launched in 2018, USD Coin is a stablecoin managed jointly by the cryptocurrency firms Circle and Coinbase through the Centre consortium.

Like tether, USD Coin is pegged to the U.S. dollar. It is the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization.

**Dai**

Running on the MakerDAO protocol, dai is a stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Created in 2015, dai (-0.01%) is pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by ether (ETH, +16.85%), the token behind Ethereum.

Unlike other stablecoins, MakerDAO intends for dai to be decentralized, meaning there’s no central authority trusted with control of the system. Rather, Ethereum smart contracts – which encode rules that can’t be changed – have this job instead.

There are still problems with this innovative model, however; for example, if the smart contracts underpinning MakerDAO don’t work exactly as anticipated. Indeed, they were gamed earlier this year, leading to losses of $8 million.

**Diem**

Diem (formerly known as Libra) is a stablecoin in the works, originally conceived by the powerful, worldwide social media platform Facebook. While libra hasn’t launched, it’s had more psychological impact than any other stablecoin. **I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because fuck facebook.**

Governments, notably China’s, are now exploring their own crypto-inspired digital currencies, in part because they’re worried Diem would be a competitive threat since Facebook is a multinational company with billions of users from across the globe.

Initially, the Diem Association, the consortium set up by Facebook, said Diem would be backed by a “basket” of currencies, including the U.S. dollar and the euro. But due to global regulatory concerns, the association has since backed off from its ambitious original vision. Instead, it is now planning to focus on developing multiple stablecoins, each backed by a separate national currency.

Its first stablecoin, the Diem dollar, is expected to launch in 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There are a few drawbacks to stablecoins to keep in mind. Because of the way stablecoins are typically set up, they have different pain points than other cryptocurrencies.

Crypto publication The Capital, for instance, argues that while stablecoins are called “stable,” they are only as stable as the asset that the stablecoin is tied to. Traditionally, the price of the dollar is very stable, but if that were to change, any fluctuations in the value of the dollar would be reflected in the stablecoin.

If the reserves are stored with a bank or some other third party, another vulnerability is counterparty risk. This boils down to the question: Does the entity really have the collateral it claims to have? This has been a question frequently posed to Tether, for instance, without clear answers. Tether has yet to provide a full open audit of its reserves.

Many stablecoin issuers don’t provide transparency about where their reserves are held, which can help a user determine how risky the stablecoin is to invest in. Knowing where their money is held, users can see if a stablecoin is operating without a license in the region where the reserves are held. If the stablecoin operators don’t have a license, a regulator could potentially freeze the stablecoin’s underlying funds, for instance.

Further, it’s possible the reserves backing a stablecoin could turn out to be insufficient to redeem every unit, potentially shaking confidence in the coin.

Cryptocurrencies were created to replace intermediary companies that are typically trusted with a user’s money.

Pasttuesday,"A lot of people invested in eth since 2017 have some sort of CDP or Collateralized debt position open.

This is the power of ethereum, you can create ""smart contracts"" on the internet. These are decentralized and persistent. Once the controller of the smart contract has given up the power, these things can run on their own into infinity. This is why people buying NFTs for millions of dollars feel safe doing it. They trust that Ethereum and the NFT smart contract will stay there, even if the creators disappear.

What is a smart contract? It is code that can also be the owner of money. You can send your money into it and it can do different things with it - put it into a pool with other participants and draw a lottery for example. Or take your money and earn interest.

A collateralized debt position on makerdao is one such smart contract. The rules are: Put in value (eth or some other token) and withdraw dai (a cryptocurrency always worth 1 US dollar). You can take out as much money as you want, as long as your collateral is 150 percent higher than your debt. 

You can do whatever you want with your dai. Those who are bullish on eth, many times take that dai and buy more eth with it. Some take it and pay off real life expenses as they want to stay exposed to eth and don't want to sell. If eth value goes up, sell less eth to retrieve the amount of dai you owe, and pay off your loan.

There are many many more use cases, many of which are not in traditional finance. In addition, you can build one on top of another without permission. Many other smart contracts build off the makerdao platform as dollar denominated currencies are needed a lot of the time.

ApoIIoCreed,"&gt; If ethereum crashes and the collateral has to be liquidated, then that value is absorbed into Maker.

Ether's price crashing is not good for Maker and is far and away the #1 risk to Maker. Liquidations are not intended to make profit, it's simply the protocol allowing 3rd parties to purchase the collateralized ETH in the hopes of breaking even. And if ETH flash-crashes faster than the MakerDAO oracle updates (I believe this is once per an hour still), then the protocol could still be underwater even after liquidations. In this case, the protocol actually mints new MKR, diluting holders, in order to sell it for DAI on the open market. 

****

Just look at Black Thursday in March 2020 to see how bad ETH price crashes could impact MKR. The network was so clogged, that people were scooping up ETH at extreme discounts. MKR had to be minted and sold on the open market to make up the difference. In a single day, MKR had to mint more tokens than they had sold up to that point. This is why the total supply of MKR temporarily increased past the 1 Million initial supply.",2021-05-05 00:21:31
ApoIIoCreed,"&gt; If you guys can’t understand how at times Maker will capture the value in ether (or whatever is staked as collateral) when crypto tanks (as it does on occasion in case y’all forgot) ... then it’s not worth the discussion

No, this actually really needs to be discussed with you because it seems that you have a completely backwards understanding of what vault liquidation means to MKR. You say this twice in this thread, and it does not make sense.

Liquidations do not mean that ""the collateral is absorbed into Maker"". Liquidations are far and away the biggest risk to Maker and vaults are constructed to reflect that. That is why the stability fee is higher for vaults with lower minimum collateralization ratios -- more risk to MakerDAO means that the token holders are demanding higher fees to do so.",2021-05-05 00:28:45

&gt; Because rETH is ETH, but it's an ETH derivative that outpaces ETH supply growth, by capturing ETH staking rewards. Deposit rETH into MakerDAO. If Rocket Pool has built its code correctly, then rETH should be an extremely favorable collateral type in every DeFi application that also accepts ETH. If you allow ETH collateral, wouldn't you also be interested in a staked ETH derivative asset? Controlling for contract risk, then rETH should actually have favorable risk parameters versus ETH, because of how it's designed to naturally outpace ETH. We should expect some sort of tokenized staked ETH asset like rETH to be added as a collateral to MakerDAO, which means we can borrow DAI against our staked ETH! Collateral = ETH. Your collateral is ETH. Not just ETH, but a derivative of ETH that captures ETH staking issuance and ETH MEV fees.

azdre,"The ""average person"" would most likely never even know they're engaging with a blockchain application.

In the hypothetical ""ETH blockchain Uber app kills Uber the company"" future, the entire experience would feel no different from what it is now (or at least not worse). The whole process would play out essentially the same way, the key difference being Uber the company isn't taking a cut of your payment to the driver for their ""services"" - ideally the driver gets the full payment and any ""fees"" would be simply the cost of the transaction on the network (which in this hypothetical future would be minimal).

The level of exposure to the underlying tech of the application stack would be entirely up to the developers and market conditions. 

Vitalik's point is that blockchain \[Ethereum\] allows for all the custodial efforts Uber adds to the equation to be automated via smart-contracting on the blockchain effectively rendering them useless in the grand scheme of things. Aside from being able to call Uber and talk to an employee, there isn't really anything about their product that can't be ported over to a blockchain solution.

Why pay Uber for this service when you can use the ""ETH Uber"" alternative that offers cheaper rides or the guarantee 100% of your payment goes to the driver and not some private company?

The ""how"" will be left up to the free market. A blockchain ""Uber"" alternative could very easily be developed by a private company and monetized, but it could also be developed by the Ethereum community and offered for ""free."" The point of the quote is that it's **possible** and that's what's so exciting about Ethereum and blockchain in general - it's opening up potential alternatives in nearly every existing industry and we're already seeing new industry emerge from the crypto space itself.

I remember back when MakerDAO first popped onto the scene and the ""potential"" it had to disrupt traditional finance. People were saying the same things...""*HOW?...WHY?...It's too confusing!*""

TimbukNine,"Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. Your thoughts on how crypto can improve the current situation are pretty much on point. Let's take it a little further and explore the DeFi approach:

What if an ETH whale wanted to buy that house. It seems to me there are several choices here:

**1) Sell their crypto, pay the capital gains and buy the house outright**

This approach would be good if they wanted to diversify away from crypto into property but does mean that they'd miss out on all those sweet gainz. No bank involved because there's no loan so not really relevant to our discussion.

**2) Our bullish whale could mint some DAI using MakerDAO**

This approach would mean locking up a lot of ETH to create the DAI and pay taxes/fees. For a $1m house this would be $1.5m worth of ETH as collateral. I'm not sure what the tax position would be on this ""loan"" (any thoughts?). The DAI is sold for USD with some slippage and the USD transferred to a bank account. This is then used to pay for the house outright.

Over time ETH rises and falls and our whale earns more ETH which in turn goes to buy DAI and pay off the loan, thus returning their original ETH.

**3) Our whale could shortcut the DAI and use Alchemix**

This approach would have our whale putting their ETH into Alchemix using $2m for a higher level of collateral. Alchemix then uses Yearn to create an interest bearing investment using the ETH and provides the DAI immediately for spending as in option 2. Over time the interest earned through Yearn pays down the original collateral until all is unlocked.

That's my understanding of the current crypto solutions to this problem. What do you think?",2021-05-06 21:35:00

2) DeFi -&gt; financing a business has just happened last month. MakerDAO is pioneering a way for business owners to collateralize and finance business properties. The property is placed into a legal trust which will follow instructions from the blockchain. If a property falls into default, the protocol can issue a liquidation order.

greencycles,"Side note, what's your opinion on DAI from MakerDAO?",2021-05-07 04:53:30
The_Roaring_Fork,"Decentralized Autonomous Organizations: An early use case unearthed by Ethereum developers, decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, are blockchain-based organizations that operate without central authorities. They are governed by rules coded in software and administrative decisions are voted upon by a community of stakeholders. DAOs were one of the first innovations tested on Ethereum and remain influential today. While the hack of the pioneering Ethereum-based DAO in 2016 was a watershed moment in blockchain history, DAOs remain open-source and community-governed. Today, several DAOs, including MolochDAO and MetaCartel, operate in a similar fashion to the original DAO, pooling user funds to offer grants to Ethereum entrepreneurs. 

Token Launches: Initial coin offerings, or ICOs, are token sales that function similarly to the traditional initial public offering (IPO). Ethereum-enabled startup fundraising played a huge role in the growth of blockchain and crypto throughout 2017 and 2018. While Ethereum’s use of crowdfunding to bolster its protocol’s development in 2014 was novel, token launches exploded during what is known as the ICO boom. This increase in funding for crypto startups presented a paradigm shift in the way innovative startups raise funds. 

ICOs garnered significant mainstream attention for Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency space, but not all positive. Amidst the frenzy, some ICOs were not well conceived, a few were outright scams, while others were unable to achieve their goals — less than half of ICOs survived four months after their initial token sale. However, many projects that raised funds through an ICO are thriving — like prediction market company Augur and privacy-centric web browser Brave. 

Displaying its ability to support the blockchain-industry as a whole, Ethereum is the mechanism by which large blockchain projects launch and raise money. For example, EOS initially launched its token sale on Ethereum before migrating the tokens to its own blockchain. These token launches played a huge role in turning blockchain into a global phenomenon. 

Enterprise Ethereum: Enterprise Ethereum refers to customized software and networks based on Ethereum that are created for private corporations and businesses. These networks are permissioned, meaning enterprise clients retain control over the architecture, the validators, and the users. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) now has more than 200 member organizations including Samsung Group, J.P. Morgan, Mastercard, and Microsoft — all of whom are experimenting with private versions of Ethereum for enterprise purposes. J.P. Morgan and more than 300 banks use a version of Enterprise Ethereum to run an inter-bank payment network. The Covantis initiative, set up by a group of institutions in the commodity industry, uses Enterprise Ethereum to run a post-trade execution platform for agricultural shipping transactions. And, Microsoft and Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) adopted Enterprise Ethereum to build a tracking platform for luxury goods. 

NFTs: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique, indivisible, and provably scarce digital assets that are useful in gaming, art, and ensuring the provenance of luxury goods. Hype over NFTs began in late 2017 with the launch of CryptoKitties’ digital cat collectibles, but since then, the applications for the technology have grown rapidly. NFTs have attracted an increasingly mainstream audience to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. The NBA, Ubisoft, and LVMH are experimenting with NFTs. 

Stablecoins: Stablecoins are cryptocurrency tokens pegged to another asset, typically a fiat currency. For example, there are stablecoins backed by fiat currencies like USD and commodities like gold, while other stablecoins maintain their value algorithmically. Additionally, some stablecoins are backed by a balanced basket of major cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins are used as a reliable store of value in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, a hedge against price volatility for crypto traders, and a stable, global currency for people whose local fiat currency is devalued due to economic or political instability. Tether is the oldest and largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Today, many crypto exchanges have their own stablecoin.   

DeFi: Decentralized finance (DeFi) is the newest innovation to see an avalanche of use and growth on Ethereum. DeFi platforms are reinventing traditional financial products and services, adding programmable, decentralized, and censorship resistant features to create brand new financial products. For example, DeFi platforms offer peer-to-peer borrowing and lending, interest on crypto holdings, decentralized exchange mechanisms, stablecoins, and composable features that maximize passive earning opportunities. Popular DeFi platforms include Compound, MakerDAO, and Aave. In 2020, the total value locked in DeFi platforms eclipsed $4 billion. ",2021-05-07 09:48:28

I believe you can do this.  Like if ETH doubles and you want more DAI and want to increase your loan then afaik that's ok within limits.

Sure, if eth is the only asset and you're not able to buy DAI through other means.  If we're thinking about it like a traditional loan then hypothetically someone could put their fiat from other income through an exchange to buy DAI and pay it back.

Snoo-8719,"\~30% respondents ""feel"" like it is possible a coordinated action on MKR to perturbate the value of DAI. Even if the mechanism is not identified, this possibility may be a factor to deter some users from using DAI. I think this could be alleviated by explaining better the interplay between MR, DAI and the rest of the crypto market ecosystem. In practice, there are many scenarios that could be simulated using multi-agent simulations. The result of the many scenarios could be published and peer reviewed to demonstrate that DAI is resilient to certain scenarios and not resilient to other scenarios.

Neophyte-,"the makerDaO system to mint dai is basically a way to take out a loan against your collateral (crypto)

you do this for reasons like you would any other loan in the classic financial world

- to buy something else investment/speculation e.g. use the dai to buy eth

- take advantage of interest rates differences. you mint dai at a 5.5% stability fee, loan it out on compound for 12% or pay off a debt that has an interest rate higher than 5.5% e.g. credit card at 22%

The difference between loans in the crypto world and real life is that your collateral source in real life can vary greatly e.g. use your house to secure a mortgage. in the case of unsecured loans e.g. personal loan from the bank or a credit card. there is a regulatory / legal framework to protect lenders so that you pay back the money.",2021-05-09 06:58:49

There are a couple with charity in mind:

- The UNICEF blockchain division in New York
- The bounties network
- The Commons stack
- The Open Money Initiative
- Gitcoin
- Giveth

As someone who worked in charity before working as a blockchain dev, charities also have tremendous difficulties.
Often donations don't go to the charities mission but are eaten by operation costs. They have transparency concerns. They have retention issues because they don't pay well and political issues because being a charity director is a ego boost when you have another career on the side that pays the bills.
Those might also be interesting problems to solve with blockchain.

Zilliqa has an incubation program called ZILHive(https://zilhive.org/), providing grants to have more dapps built on Zilliqa.

Soon, Zilliqa will have another dapp released called Pillar Protocol(https://pillarprotocol.com/), similar to MakerDao on Ethereum.

Another exciting item is Zilliqa will have a bridge between Zilliqa and other blockchains in sometime Q2 so other tokens such as ETH will be available to be wrapped and used on the Zilliqa chain.

Also, they’ve had a recent partnership with Polaris sports which works with some high-profile sports stars like James Rodriguez and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Another significant partnership is Xfers which is considered the PayPal of Southeast Asia, and Xfers is partnered with PayPal, Gemini and Coinbase.

So as eth goes up in a bull market, if the thing it's paired with doesn't perform even better you'll guaranteed end up with less ETH, it's the mechanics of AMMs.

I expect insurers to start issuing policies for non-crypto assets and have claims processes on-chain for transparency and speed.

Transfer and registry of property sales/ownership to come on chain.

Objects where provenance is important to come on chain (food/luxury brands/live stock/commodities generally?) 

Business accounting - on chain auditing of business finance will be cheaper, quicker and transparent. Helping prevent fraud/better company valuation. There is a significant feeling that current auditing is problematic.

Ticket sales and the like to be completed and issued via NFT.

I expect ETF and derivatives and other financial instruments to listed and be available to investors on chain.  This will make then more efficient to run, better returns for all involved and far more accessible. It’s would. In theory allow access to a world wide equity market rather that being limited to your local stock exchange.

Ownership and repayment of financial products - e.g. car finance and other lease purchases. 

Loans generally. Mostly collateralised in de-fi against existing assets that allow funds to be released for spending and investing - MakerDAO - growth of collaterised asset growing faster than borrowings. 

Self-repaying loans - see Alchemix.

Yield farming of growth assets - e.g. rETH once rocket pool launches.

Once scaling is resolved it will be difficult for anything with a process, that involves interaction with third parties no to be on chain.

, DeFi's ""central bank"" and the issuer of the DAI stablecoin. Arguably one of the most important dApps.

Palmboom333,"They are currently focussing on crypto minded companies. With AAVE, MakerDAO, OCEAN, Gnosis, The Graph and others, I think they are doing a pretty good job.

Currently they are looking for a Business Development Manager so I can see more DAO's and crypto minded companies being onboarded in the next months",2021-05-10 21:00:21
Pickinanameainteasy,"I know I am too. I tried MakerDAO but the gas fees were absurd for just a small loan of DAI. I've been looking into Polygon which is a sidechain I believe. You bridge your ETH from the mainnet to polygon for a pretty big gas fee but then once you do that you can do defi transactions for much lower gas. If you've ever used Lightning network on bitcoin its kind of like that. However, there aren't too many defi apps on polygon right now but there are some, like i think Aave is on polygon.

I've also been looking into dracula protocol that looks really interesting but again gas fees.

Use this site to gauge gas ([https://www.gasnow.org/](https://www.gasnow.org/)). Like right now gas is unbeliveable like higher than i've ever seen. 50 is supposed to be average, 20 is good, anything over 100 is really high and its like 300 right now which is crazy.",2021-05-10 21:31:03

Coldsnap,"Hello Eth-fam! This is this week’s ETHosphere Timeline update where I state many of the big things upcoming in Ethereum in one big consolidated list. Sorry for repost - I f'd up and linked to c0intelegraph. Many thanks u/zk_snacks! 

~The big news this week was **[the launch of Uniswap v3](https://uniswap.org/blog/launch-uniswap-v3/)!** Always good to see a big update like this deliver on time. The launch wasn’t painless and the fees are still eye-watering, but it’s out in the wild now with $500m TVL as of today - hope you’ve all got your tight ranges set appropriately and that you were rewarded with rare [sparkly phalluses](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1390034790653599746). That just leaves one big unanswered question… Optimism on v3 wen? Official update is that there’s no definitive date yet. Grumble.

~Speaking of optimistic rollups, [OKEx announced itself](https://www.okex.com/support/hc/en-us/articles/360060706511) as the first major centralised exchange to **enable direct deposits and withdrawals to its impending layer 2 rollups integration with Arbitrum**. This is great because it means users will be able to bypass expensive fees on the L1 and trade immediately on L2. L2 bridges to other dapps will only enhance this, until we have a whole ecosystem of L2 dapps to choose from. Now, we still don’t know when Arbitrum is going to launch (it’s on the timeline for May) but its mainnet release candidate is already up on the Kovan testnet - it’s got to be soon. Offchain Labs, please!

~To round up dapp updates, decentralised staking pool solution **Rocketpool announced a subsequent round of security audits that will kick off on 17 May**. This is off the back of initial audits findings to ensure those findings have been properly implemented. Audits on top of audits? Maybe evenmoar audits needed! Timeline-wise, this probably pushes back the mainnet release to July, although June feels possible if things move quickly. This, I’m sure, is frustrating for those who had originally hoped the project would launch in March, but the team have been steadfast in their resolve to not launch until security auditing is fully completed and findings implemented. Stay strong early adopters, your time will come!

Protocol updates:

~ **The Merge: The Rayonism hackathon enters its final week this week.** A good summary of the work to date [is here](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40benjaminion%2Fwnie2_210508#Rayonism). This week the aim will be to get a less transient merge testnet in place off the back of learnings from last week’s successful test. Still looking good, and discussions around the post-London feature fork (Shanghai) will be enlightened by the results of Rayonism.

~ **London / EIP-1559:** Still on track for 14 July, the [Baikal devnet](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/client-integration-testnets/baikal.md) is running. Proposed block numbers and testnet fork dates [are public](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/245). A [new call](https://youtu.be/qce2M4ot8ls) to discuss operational readiness for the upgrade has started. This seeks to align all stakeholders across the various related projects (eg tooling, libraries) to ensure nothing is missed ahead of the upgrade. A [handy tracker](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/london.md#ecosystem-readiness-checklist) exists! Additionally, there were a few technical improvements/fixes proposed for the 1559 spec which Tim Beiko [covers here](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1390706275722227713).

~ **Altair: The summer Eth2 upgrade, is progressing in parallel.** [Latest update from the client teams is that July](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40benjaminion%2Fwnie2_210508#Altair), or possibly early August, is the current launch ambition. This is consistent with the previous update.

Super!

nikola_j,"&gt;Has anyone done this before using Defi Saver? Any insights, tips. and/or  recommendations would be helpful. Is it really as simple as entering  the new ETH address and hitting transfer? 

Hundreds of people and indeed it is that simple.

I guess people think this is something custom we made, but it actually just uses the transfer function that exists in MakerDAO, but isn't exposed to users anywhere in Oasis for whatever reason.

The only thing worth noting is that you cannot transfer a CDP/Vault to a smart contract wallet (e.g. to a Gnosis Safe, Argent, etc) and the target destination has to be an EOA. The app will stop you if you try to, anyway.",2021-05-11 00:18:56

nikola_j,"Besides MakerDAO making changes, other apps and parts of the ecosystem have made improvements, too.

On our end, at DeFi Saver, Black Friday was the last liquidations event, and even then the reason some of the automated CDPs/Vaults went under was because of system [design limitations](https://medium.com/defi-saver/black-thursday-at-defi-saver-3c35ea6cd0d0) at the moment.

Currently, there's 294k ETH and a bunch of other assets totalling over $1.2b that are automated and protected against liquidation at DeFi Saver. The Automation system had no issues protecting all positions in any recent crashes, like that one in late February, for example, the one with the very memorable 1500+ Gwei gas prices.

Additionally, there are some other options out there that aim to provide more stability to Maker in massive price swings. For example, there's also B.Protocol, which uses an alternative  liquidations engine powered by a dedicated group of liquidators, where liquidations happen instantly (as they do in Liquidations 2.0 in MakerDAO, too) and half of the profits from the auction goes back to users of B.Protocol.

Overall, I would definitely agree with u/LongForWisdom's hint that the protocol and the whole ecosystem is much readier for large market swings than it was back then.",2021-05-11 01:49:44
nikola_j,"That's pretty odd, was this specifically under [https://app.defisaver.com/makerdao/](https://app.defisaver.com/makerdao/) or in the portfolio page?

The portfolio page runs off an API for Maker data, so it may not be 100% correct all of the time, while the actual Maker dashboard fetches data directly from the chain.

If you enter your account address at [https://defiexplore.com/](https://defiexplore.com/) does it show up?

P.S. If you'd like us to figure this out, please do feel free to DM, I mentioned I'm from the DFS team. Though I also assume Oasis will be back in working order soon, so definitely don't mean to press you into using DeFi Saver if you rather wouldn't or anything like that.",2021-05-11 02:27:41

2) Consider borrowing against your ETH (MakerDAO for instance) and selling the borrowed DAI/whatever instead of ETH.

satorimon,"In a scenario where you need money to do something in the real world and you don't want to sell your crypto, you can borrow against it rather than selling it.  On MakerDAO (Oasis) you can borrow against ETH at a reasonable rate (3.5-5% depending on the collateralization rate).   In this case you are putting up a deflationary asset (ETH) and borrowing an inflationary asset (DAI).  You move your DAI to a centralized exchange and sell it for USD.  While the loan is out, your USD loses value as the Feds printing press prints more, and ETH gains value, increasing your collateralization rate.  

Alchemix has a new type of loan that pays itself off over time, because they put your collateral to work in DeFi.  Currently supports DAI as collateral, but they are adding ETH as collateral later this summer.",2021-05-11 06:07:23

PhiMarHal,"I could use an eli5 myself, but from what I know:

DAI are minted when someone locks crypto assets in a vault. Vaults are overcollateralized compared to the amount of minted DAI, and if the dollar value of that collateral falls too low, that collateral can be liquidated.

The peg is maintained by the MakerDAO governance, adjusting parameters like debt ceiling, interest rate and others to keep Dai as close to the dollar as possible. 

MKR holders get a cut of the fees (vault fees are paid in MKR, and that MKR is burned), but in exchange they're lenders of last resort, through dilution. For example, the protocol minted 20k MKR in March 2020 after a flash crash combined with extreme gas prices triggering liquidations exploited by bots winning collateral auctions for free.

iamiamwhoami,"There are non volatile cryptos. But I'm skeptical there will ever be a decentralized crypto that controls inflation as well as the Fed. So far the one that comes closest is MakerDAO, but that relies on similar market mechanisms as the Fed does to control USD. The difference is those market mechanisms are enforced via smart contracts as opposed to a central decision making body. They heavily rely on the assumption that the incentives of the people that participate in that market are in line with the dynamics that control inflation/volatility. This works more often than not, but there are market failures and are open to malicious attacks, which there most definitely will be if doing so means massively hurting the US economy.",2021-05-12 02:24:09

The primary core of the cryptocurrency won't change. Bitcoin is capped at 21 million. They can mess with fees, or some devs can fork it and make another coin that has a higher cap, but Bitcoin itself will stay capped.

If a majority of the community votes to increase the cap then it can be done, but that comes back to democratic control without a single political entity making unilateral decisions.",2021-05-12 02:31:15

cryptOwOcurrency,"&gt; Then, Cardano blockchain will support Solidity so that the same smart contracts can be ported to manage those new tokens.

Cardano will support Solidity only on the KEVM sidechain according to the current roadmap. How would a smart contract system, like for example MakerDAO or Compound, be able to work with its smart contract logic split between Ethereum and Cardano's KEVM sidechain?

&gt; The smart contracts on Etherium will continue to exist but won’t manage the new tokens, so liquidity can move over and then behave in the same manner as before.

Sorry if I am reading your comment wrong, but are you talking about a token that is centrally managed/minted/burned by two separate canonical contracts, one on Ethereum and one on Cardano's KEVM sidechain? Otherwise there will always be one contract that mints, backs, and burns tokens, and that contract will have to live in one place - Ethereum, Cardano KEVM or Cardano proper - and only its tokens will be portable across chains  due to the bridge, but not its token logic.

r-2-eth-2,"****

&gt; Because rETH is ETH, but it's an ETH derivative that outpaces ETH supply growth, by capturing ETH staking rewards. Deposit rETH into MakerDAO. If Rocket Pool has built its code correctly, then rETH should be an extremely favorable collateral type in every DeFi application that also accepts ETH. If you allow ETH collateral, wouldn't you also be interested in a staked ETH derivative asset? Controlling for contract risk, then rETH should actually have favorable risk parameters versus ETH, because of how it's designed to naturally outpace ETH. We should expect some sort of tokenized staked ETH asset like rETH to be added as a collateral to MakerDAO, which means we can borrow DAI against our staked ETH! Collateral = ETH. Your collateral is ETH. Not just ETH, but a derivative of ETH that captures ETH staking issuance and ETH MEV fees.

Zilliqa has an incubation program called ZILHive(https://zilhive.org/), providing grants to have more dapps built on Zilliqa.

Soon, Zilliqa will have another dapp released called Pillar Protocol(https://pillarprotocol.com/), similar to MakerDao on Ethereum.

Another exciting item is Zilliqa will have a bridge between Zilliqa and other blockchains in sometime Q2 so other tokens such as ETH will be available to be wrapped and used on the Zilliqa chain.

Also, they’ve had a recent partnership with Polaris sports which works with some high-profile sports stars like James Rodriguez and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Another significant partnership is Xfers which is considered the PayPal of Southeast Asia, and Xfers is partnered with PayPal, Gemini and Coinbase. Zilliqa created a stable coin used on the Zilliqa chain for Xfers. Also, Zilliqa and Xfers performed a pilot test to demonstrate how the XSGD stablecoin can enable the transfer of event risks via Zilliqa blockchain-based smart contracts.

FaceDeer,"Yes, but with a major caveat.

Back when the ETC/ETH split happened there weren't any major smart contracts running on Ethereum yet, especially not smart contracts that held value external to the blockchain itself. So when the chain forked it was a simple enough matter for the market to divide the value of the chain's tokens up between them.

Nowadays there's a bunch of DeFi contracts on Ethereum, wrapped tokens and side chains and NFTs and such, which cannot be ""split"" between the chains. The MakerDAO on one of the chains will have full value, the other MakerDAO will have zero. An NFT representing something off-chain (such as a tweet or a painting) cannot be valid on both chains, only one will be recognized. And since these things all interact with each other it's likely that they'll all wind up going with the same fork, leaving the other fork a wasteland.

So even though a fork of Ethereum 2.0 will be *technically* easy and secure, it's going to be a massive challenge to get it accepted. And if it were accepted it'd probably mean the death of the *other* chain due to losing most of its ecosystem, so there'll still just be one viable chain afterward.

It's regrettable, I liked that a blockchain could simply fission when there were irreconcilable differences between subgroups of its users. But that's just the way things are and I can't see a way to make it not like that without losing a ton of the advances Ethereum has made over the years in the process.",2021-05-15 16:21:17
FaceDeer,"Why did ETC fork pre-merge? Due to an irreconcilable philosophical difference between two groups of the blockchain's users. Such a difference could arise post-merge as well.

Unfortunately even though a split would be more easily technically feasible in Ethereum 2.0 there would be other forces that made it harder, I mention those in more detail in the other comment I posted in this thread. Basically, stuff like MakerDAO or NFTs can't split between the forks - it's all or nothing.",2021-05-15 16:24:33

McBeaster,"Depends if ETH 2.0 succeeds or not. Polkadot and ATOM aim to tie everything together, but DOT has an easier avenue to value accrual than ATOM does. Cardano and BNB maybe, longshots would be Solana or Algorand if they are that much faster and cheaper than everything else and everyone starts building on them. The Defi bluechips like MakerDAO, Aave, Terra et al have a shot as well:
  
There's like $130 billion total value locked in DeFi right now. In the next 5 years, what do you expect that number to be? It's easier to make projections for specific projects in the context of the overall market. For example, MakerDAO has ~15 billion TVL and a market cap of ~5 billion. To get to $500 billion, it would need 1.5 trillion locked and a total DeFi market cap of ~13 trillion. These numbers will change relative to each other too.  
  
ThorChain has a shot if it becomes *the* place to earn yield on BTC and Eth, rather then the centralized options available now. $1 dollar in liquidity locked in ThorChain requires $3 of RUNE, so it could get there.

jibishot,"I think this will have to be thought about, but the actual rpl token isnt even out yet. So its entire tokenomics arent known nor all uses of the token (gov, vesting rpl, farm for liq, idk). It seems disingenuous to assume that its inflationary so now you know everything. Ill remind everyone thats the same argument used against ether for years, only this year have i seen it start to slow down.

Tax wise, absolutely has to be carefully thought about as usual. I see most validators overcolaterazing with earned rpl, aside from outright converting. Which is vesting and a hold on the token vs inflation. Also i would be suprised if there wasnt a vest option for non validators as well. Honestly, i see most taxation in the future not from outright selling but hedging against assets. Something akin to alchemix with more assets; or makerDAO- which simplifies the taxation elements to a single token -&gt; fiat interaction.",2021-05-16 07:50:51

* Basing an economy on a deflationary currency crashes everything during recessions. 

These are the three primary problems with Bitcoin technology that make it incapable of replacing fiat money.  Ethereum 2 is trying to fix the first with proof of work although there're skepticism on this solution and alternative approaches.   BCH and XRP are trying to fix the second, and both work pretty well.  MakerDao is trying to solve the last.  I haven't seen a project adequately address all three.

If you are diversifying you need to understand what you are diversifying into and why.

Being a 2nd mover when ETH's network effect leads were already in place since **late 2016** puts it at a special kind of disadvantage as most institutional investors and financiers are inherently conservative in outlook when it comes to adoption of new architecture and will look to use what's already demonstrably working.

Neophyte-,"they are completely different. but firstly there is a difference between doing blockchain dev and a smart contract dev. 

blockchain dev is making changes to the protocol itself e.g. implementing segwit in bitcoin or an EIP in ethereum. this requires advanced knowledge of blockchain, cryptography and a deep understanding of how the particular blockchain works. a very steep learning curve.

As for smart contracts, bitcoin / eth both have them. you dont hear about smart contracts in bitcoin but they are there, just not very interesting or powerful with what you can do. smart contract dev is much easier to pick up. 

bitcoin uses the script language in their smart contracts, a stack based language thats not turing complete (no loops), contracts are limited in the opcodes available and space in a transaction. the contracts are used for things like timelocks used in LN and more im not aware of, but its boring stuff.

ethereum is a turing complete blockchain (can solve a problem any other computer can solve) it uses solidity or viper (python based). id go with solidity if you want to start since there are many more examples. with smart contracts on ethereum, the world is your oyster in what you can do, but most compute / memory access heavy code is going to be expensive to operate. when you execute smart contracts in ethereum every step in the code costs GAS. with gas prices now, even interacting with an ERC20 token to send a token is at time of this writing 22$ usd, a few days ago it was over 100$. 

a more complex example makerdao to open a vault, you are looking at probably 150$ at gas prices or more.

if youre looking for a good course id suggest, this is what the ethdev sub recommended to me.

https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/

if you have a programming background its not hard to pick up. iff you dont have a programming background id probably start off doing centralised dev (for lack of a better term) and learn python (one of the easiest langagues to learn)

worth mentioning that with smart contract dev, you need to have a good understanding of data structures to not waste gas and in general have a good understanding of fundamental programming constructs that apply across all langauges",2021-05-17 03:42:58

lalexanderp,Agreed. I think that should be our end goal though. Maybe having a DAI pegged to dominant currencies ($¥€£) then a global DAI pegged to the pooled value of these major currencies could speed up adoption for both domestic and international cross-border use.

michaeldnorman,"These are great questions. Keep learning and don't be afraid to ask. Here are some answers that may be helpful:  


1. A deployed contract is indeed immutable. But Proxy Contracts allow the contract owner to upgrade their contracts to a new version. This allows for bug fixes. Many contracts use this mechanism in order to update their contracts.
2. They can do this if they have built in a mechanism to do so. For example, imagine a line of code that checks the contract storage for a flag, and based on the answer, revert any attempts to trade the token. Then, if they are the owner, they can call a function to set that flag to stop trading for a short period of time, and call the function to clear it later.
3. Unfortunately, I don’t know how CEX’s are implemented. Maybe someone else can help.
4. Yes, it’s possible to write pretty much any computable logic into a contract. This capability really brings out the power of smart contracts.
5. Time-based functions are difficult to implement because time can’t be trusted on chain. However, you can use an off-chain oracle to provide a time for time-based functions.
6. Sure, as long as the cap can be computed on chain or oracle’d in.
7. I don’t know if it’s documented in a central place, because there are so many different potentials, and folks are inventing new ways every day. But check out how some popular approaches work like MakerDAO and others.
8. There are likely several, but it’s hard to say which ones you should join. What I’ve done is read up on one of the tokens that I’m interested in learning more about, and that leads to further research, etc. Google searches can be fine – just never give out your seed to any person or company. There are a lot of scams out there.
9. I’d recommend reading the source. Any contract that’s worth anything has the source code out there.
10. You’re right that security is the key component here. If the system can be gamed, it will be.

Keep learning! There are tons of resources out there, and i’d encourage you to write your own contract to really understand it well.",2021-05-17 10:19:59

Questions for you:

1. Your answer to #2..flags to stop/start trading.. jeezzuss...that seems like something I should absolutely look for in contracts - either via rugscreen, tokensniffer or other means. Has this ever been the source of an exploit or rug pull?
2. Related to #4, where do the contract ""innovators"" hang out? Has anyone ever tried this? Where do I go and discuss/debate some of these ideas?
3. How do I tip you for the help? Or otherwise appreciate? 
4. Interested in working together possibly? See my upcoming project(s) at wedevcrypto dot com.. i'm the founder. Small team on TG for now.. me and a few others so far..

SETUBANCO,"En eso ya se esta trabajando en el mundo DeFi, la tokenizacion de acciones como el desarrollo de sintéticos, esto ya existe pasa que esta en una etapa experimental como todo el ecosistema crypto, creo que este año y el siguiente va ser el boom de las DeFi mas que un alt seasson va ser un DeFi seasson, pero creo que el secreto va estar en conocer bien el activo al cual se va entrar y tener conocimiento del ecosistema.

uno de los desafíos de DeFi es la descentralización total que es algo que se esta desarrollando el problema es que no son %100 desentralizadas y estaremos invirtiendo en productos que alguien crea pero que no estan regulados y que no tienen garantía alguna. 

Las DeFi usan MakerDAO y los contratos inteligente de etherum por ende cualquier fallo en su programación o mal intencionada programación puede derivar el una perdida de la inversión o una estafa.  pero son cuestiones que con el tiempo se van a ir arreglando. 

Con respecto a la coldwallet no por el momento no se pueden guardar dado a que el mecanismo de liquidez y de replicación del índice se da gracias al staking.

r-2-eth-2,"**Ethereum poster child MakerDAO's annual revenue breaks above $200 million**

&gt; The total projected annual revenue of lending platform MakerDAO, Ethereum's decentralized finance ""Poster child,"" has exceeded $200 million over the past weekend, according to analytics website MarketBurn. By comparison, its average annual revenue amounted to just around $19 million on January 1-an increase of nearly 1,000% in just around 4.5 months. Out of the cumulative DeFi TVL that amounted to just over $74 at press time, 17%-or $12.62 billion-was locked on MakerDAO. Per MarketBurn's data, the lion's share of Maker's revenue comes, unsurprisingly, from so-called ""Stability fees."" Per the current estimates, the platform is generating nearly $2.7 billion a year via its Ethereum-A collateral vault-that's roughly $150 million with a flat annual stability fee of 5.5%. Collateral vaults containing Wrapped Bitcoin and Chainlink tokens as well as ETH-B and ETH-C vaults and other fees are currently bringing Maker another $46 million per year on average.

Matic and Aave are Ethereum (Aave is a defi protocol, Matic (now Polygon btw) is an Ethereum layer 2 protocol for scaling, depending on Ethereum L1).

1 there’s nothing else you can do with the tokens of the other chains. There’s no defi.

ethereumflow,"Subjective. Does cryptokitties really need to be kept as secure as MakerDAO? Should they be paying the same in fees for that security? 

There are trade-offs in everything with this space. Some say proof of stake is more centralized, some remember that even BTC had a small premine and had to start somewhere and the ETH also had a premine and presale. Fair start? Okay, sure. Again, subjective to opinions. 

Proof of stake is proven that it is reliable and secure while also being more efficient and far more scalable. 

There will never be a one chain world but instead will be a multi-chain future. Some networks will require more security than others and some won't need much. Some networks will be permissioned and closed-source while some will be open-source and permissionless. This is where application specific blockchains come into the picture.

There is no consensus for proof of stake more trusted, proven and secure than Tendermint; used by more proof of stake blockchains than any other consensus engine. Over $115 billion is secured by Tendermint chains not including Binance and Matic. Tendermint is Byzantine fault tolerant designed to be as secure as Nakamoto consensus without the trade-off of poor performance and high energy consumption. 

Proof of stake is the future. It is far more usable, far less wasteful and more interactive. Why hodl when you can passively earn while helping to secure a network?

If it's banking then MakerDAO is an example that might interest him, it lets you take out loans.",2021-05-19 15:35:28
r-2-eth-2,"**Binance Smart Chain's Venus Protocol saw $200 million in liquidations. Here's why**

&gt; Venus Protocol faced massive liquidations of over $200 million on Wednesday due to a possible price manipulation of its native XVS token. For the uninitiated, the Venus protocol offers decentralized finance lending and borrowing services on Binance Smart Chain. In March 2020, the ""Black Thursday"" event led to over $8 million worth of liquidations at DeFi protocol MakerDAO. As such, the liquidations on Venus are possibly the highest to date in DeFi's history.

Rumblestillskin,There have been attempts. Some currencies have issuance decided by a vote of token holders. Also some stable coins attempt this by creating the token with another asset used as collateral and liquidating this collateral if the token drops in value (DAI/MakerDAO). Ethereum is making a change that will still issue new tokens but will burn a lot of the fees being spent which may create that situation. There is a lot of experimentation in the space beyond Bitcoin.,2021-05-20 01:34:00

Example:

MinimalGravitas,"&gt;Here is my understanding. Bob has Bitcoins. Bob wants fiat. Bob wants to avoid taxes and/or giving up his Bitcoins. Bob fails at math.

&gt;Bob puts his Bitcoins into a 2 of 3 multisig transaction. Bob has one signature, the lender has one signature, an entity they call the ""neutral third party"" has the third.

Obviously that would be a bad arrangement, but how is that related to DeFi, you've just described a completely centralized system.

In the lending platforms I know about (MakerDao and AAVE) the middleman is a smart contract that anyone can check on GitHub for flaws/scams/whatever-malicious-code and the arbitration is done through a governance token that anyone can hold and use. Users can review proposals as they come up and decide if they want to vote for the change or not.

There is also no multisig wallet you can get your funds stuck in, at any time you can pay back your loan and retrieve your collateral, no one can collude to stop you or whatever. Similarly, there is no way that the developers could access the funds that have been deposited to hand them over to the government, the code that the smart contract holding the funds uses is running on the blockchain and you can verify that there is no backdoor or anything before deciding to use it. The worst the government could do would be to shut down the front facing website, but users could still interact with the smart contract over the network, it would just be less coinvent to do so.

With regard to Bob losing his job, there is no time limit to how long the loans I've seen can run, if Bob got another job and wanted to get his coins back by paying the loan 8 years later they would still be there waiting.

I don't want to sound like I'm completely disagreeing with you. Your point about price fluctuations is correct and represents a real risk with any kind of loan where a crypto with fluctuating value is used as collateral for a different one or a stablecoin. All investing carries risk. It's worth noting that even in this situation you will not have lost everything, you've still got whatever you borrowed. As an example... if you deposit 1 bitcoin when the price is $100k, you borrow $30k of USDC. The price of bitcoin then crashes and when the value of your deposit reaches the liquidation threshold your bitcoin is gone for good. The liquidation threshold for bitcoin on AAVE is 75%, so if the price drops to $40k you get wiped out... but you don't lose the $30k of USDC (or the flat if that's what you spent it on), so you're down $70k of portfolio value. If you had just held the bitcoin the price drop would have meant you lost $60k of portfolio value.

It's completely true that some people will get themselves in trouble, but I think that is due mostly to using stuff without understanding what they are doing, and that's as true in the legacy financial system as it is in crypto. Too many people spread hype and bullshit, presenting DeFi tools as if they are magic, 'get rich with this one weird trick', which I'm sure we both agree is one of the biggest problems in this space. On the other hand I don't think that providing false information and explaining stuff incorrectly to scare people away from things you don't think they should try is the solution either. Accurate information gives people the tools to understand and evaluate risk fairly. I would advocate every day that people should never invest in something they don't understand, never use a DeFi protocol until you can explain the maths of how it works. We can't get to that level of knowledge though if people are spreading false information.",2021-05-20 03:00:00

MKR is destroyed when the Maker Protocol’s system surplus exceeds a minimum threshold, resulting in excess Dai being auctioned for MKR that is then destroyed.

hubadl,"In my opionen, the whole crypto space was about dezentralization and power to the people. (Tether,XRP, BNB all centralized, also Binance and Tether are closely related and a little bit shady xD)

Doge is a meme,i have nothing against it but that people invest in it that much is crazy.

ADA seems like a nice project yes, but lets be honest, its so much speculation.
It is marketed as the ethereum killer, but there are not even smart contracts yet. There is no real functionality except staking. I know its coming, but it is not there and people pump it like crazy. (Please correct me if im wrong)

ETH has many years of development and a big ecosystem. (NFTs, Uniswap, Chainlink, Aave, DAOs (MakerDAO - dezentralized bank super nice :D), etc.). The Ökosystem is crazy cool and you should test some of the defi services that are available. Super cool i think :) (I was really really impressed when i tried everything out)

I dont know that much about DOT, i think one of their goals is they want to make blockchains interoperable?! I dont have any DOT, i know to less about it.

BCH is for me a very idealistic project. In my believe its true to the early ideal of electronic cash for the world. Also i really like that there are multiple dev teams which work together for the common ideal of peer to peer cash (which could end very badly also).
I know people maybe dont want to hear that here, but i think BCH is a very high risk investement. You need to overcome states and the whole finance sector if you want to be p2p cash for the world.
Also i think bch has to overcome BTC which, lets be hones, is a big brand nowadays.

ICP is just another blockchain with a massive marketing hype machinery.
Their marketing is full of buzzwords....
But i am honest i am not that into ICP, so maybe someone can tell me what smart contracts are running on ICP and what can i do with it. Why is it better than ethereum for example? (Im always sceptical of chains that suddenly pop into top 10 marketcap, with a marketing machinery like they have)

ChrolloBaby,"The Ethereum foundation website has a great guide to Ethereum development, and the solidity docs is what you would typically use to learn solidity -&gt; https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.4/

There are other tutorials aimed at introducing people to solidity Dev like crypto zombies. I think coding is fun and encourage anyone who’s interested to learn. I will say that it’s better to learn some fundamentals of programming before jumping into solidity - not that you won’t understand it, but you’re more likely to have a deeper understanding of it which would prevent misconceptions when learning solidity. If you’d like to ensure that you don’t get tricked by projects, but you don’t want to go through the effort of learning, then it might be good to stick with projects that have a reputable background with these considerations in mind. See what the project is doing and what it supposed to be for. If it’s a get rich quick scheme then it probably is a scam. If it sounds too good to be true, then it’s probably a scam. If the people talking about sound like they’re trying to sell you something like the brokers in wolf of Wall Street, then it’s probably a scam. On the flip, projects like MakerDAO are an example of something that provides (and not just promises, but actually provides) real utility and value that can be described in simple terms ex. MakerDAO allows users to take loans against assets like ETH. You might want to buy the Maker token so that you can vote for decisions that control MakerDAO like the interest on loans, or the savings rate when lending, or to participate in auctions that allow you to sell it for DAI (a stable coin pegged to USD) when there’s a surplus.

Same thing with others like ChainLink, a company that provides oracle services to smart contracts. 

Whether or not you decide to learn contract dev, being able to articulate the good or service a token is providing, as well as having conversations with people in the community behind it who’s goals aren’t just to get more people to buy it, is a good way to see if a project is likely a scam or not.",2021-05-20 22:47:33
halfdayallday123,"It’s an up front condition of doing business. If you want to take a loan in Dai, you’ve got to make sure your collateral is at or above 150% otherwise it will get liquidated and you’ll pay the penalty. Borrowers know this up front and have a chance to add collateral when their original collateral tanks in price and goes under 150%. If they can’t pony up the additional funds to get back to 150% then it gets liquidated. There’s no conflict of interest. MakerDao is in the business of lending and that is a profitable business. The lending rates are very low but the collateral requirements are very high. I consider this a secure, honest system that nobody is forced to participate in.

SkillDuel,"If a compromise had ever happened on Kovan (which it hasn't), it would be very easy to immediately identify the nefarious actors.

Kovan blocks are mined every 4 seconds. If the timestamps were ever to indicate that a compromise had occurred, that would immediately be publicized, and the reputation of Kovan (and of the Kovan Authorities) would be destroyed.

Since that has not happened in the entire 4 years that Kovan has run without a hitch, I would have much more confidence in Kovan, then some of the other technologies that are promoted on this subreddit.

The Kovan Authorities include MakerDAO and Etherscan. I don't think those entities would jeopardize their reputation by attempting to hack a simple Roulette game that is on Github.

I am not suggesting that you buy a billion dollars of MILLI. I am suggesting that you buy $100 worth, and use it instead of an ETH Mainnet token for your dApps, since the ETH Mainnet charges exorbitant transaction fees. The Uniswap v3 fee is currently $35.",2021-05-22 02:46:23
AusIV,"There are several concerns here though.

While the Kovan authorities are reputable, they signed up to manage a testnet, not a secure system. Who knows how they're securing the keys to their Kovan validators? I seriously doubt it's at the same level they would if they had intended to be securing serious value. If there were an attack on MILLIs, they'd probably claim their keys were compromised, and they might even be telling the truth.

And even if they've done a great job securing their keys and have the best of intentions for not abusing anyone, they're still subject to the laws of their jurisdictions, and it's not like their identities aren't knowable to regulators. What happens if  some government regulator knocks on the MakerDAO foundation's door and says ""Hey, by signing Kovan blocks with Milli Roulette transactions in it, you've been running an illegal gambling operation. We need you to do X to avoid criminal charges.""

None of these have been major concerns for a testnet with no appreciable value on it, so the fact that it hasn't happened in the past doesn't mean it couldn't happen if people start transacting on Kovan with real value.",2021-05-22 05:38:28
Datasurfer11,"A little story in patience...

Crypto has taught me a lot about blockchain, tech, finance, and myself. I followed the price of BTC since around 2014ish and was curious about it but never had the $ to invest, so when the time came to invest, I knew exactly what I wanted. Per mere coincidence I came across an article about ETH in 2016 with a little interactive tool that let you build smart contracts. I thought “woah that’s cool, surely BTC can do that (or they are working on it),” only to find BTC could not. Then I became obsessed with learning about Ethereum, started with the white papers, some Vitalik interviews, and ended with MakerDao, Augur and a Eth2.0 roadmap. 

Something clicked. This is what blockchain is about, decentralization and bringing some power/visibility back to the people. 

I went all in on ETH in 2017 at the top of the bull market, wasn’t a lot, but relative to me it was almost everything. Shortly after the price dropped and I was down a lot. I decided price was low and I should open a CDP (Vault) in MakerDao since I though the price would go up. Made the mistake of putting almost all my Eth into the CDP and paid the price. I was aggressively taking loans out to myself to buy more Eth and then adding back into the CDP (thought I was a genius). One day in late 2018  Eth just starts dropping to $ amounts I never though possible( or planned for). Being over leveraged and not having cash on hand to back up my CDP I was liquidated and my heart was broken. 

Being liquidated was the best thing to happen to me. Sure it sucked at the time and I may have been slightly depressed for a day or two, but it taught be valuable lessons: 

 1. Don’t trade more then you can afford to loss
2.	if you do trade on a margin make sure you have the liquidity to back it up in full
3.	don’t be emotionally connected to your investment 

Since then I’ve still been DCA’ing and look at Eth differently. It’s a tool, it has an awesome and diverse utility, use it to invest, collect NFT, yieldfarm, stake, and to help yourself and others. As another Defi summer approaches practice caution and be smart with your money. As they used to say
 “came to get rich, stayed for the Tech!” 

Lastly this community has been great. I have spent a lot of time on here reading and observing but felt I needed to share my story and start contributing more. Cant tell you guys how many times coming to this thread has helped me.

Thank you to the moderators and everyone in this community, can’t wait to see us at the top!

Using ONTO wallet you can have access to Ontology DeFi WING , Binance Smart Chain dapps and Ethereum dapps such as Uniswap, 1inch, SushiSwap, AAVE, MakerDAO and more all from the convenience of your mobile device. They also support Polkadot and NEO. 

Worth a look if you want to explore cool new options rather than dwell on red charts. You do not need ONT or ONG to use ONTO wallet",2021-05-23 00:09:18
mashtun25,"That’s fine, but it’s being used by someone for something in the real world.  When someone lends or borrows on Aave, for instance, they use smart contracts.   Now you might say that Aave is taking advantage of stupid people.  But the fact that the demand for Aave’s services keeps steadily growing, I don’t think it’s just nobodies, it’s real world demand.  The borrowers and lenders must be finding something useful to do there.  I think to dismiss it out of hand as speculation on tokens is intellectually lazy.  MakerDao is another example.

Gregarious_Larch,"For invention, protocol, and theory, you would probably want to start with the [bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper) or the more current [ethereum yellowpaper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf). Most projects have a document like this you can look at. Also most healthy projects are under active development so you can check their github or whatever for more details.

As far as investor backing is concerned, I'd say generally it happens one of three ways:

* Projects are useful, gain support, and then later tokenize for various reasons (the graph)
* The project starts with a token for some reason or another (makerdao) and the value is in the function of the project
* The currency appeals to people enough (usually because of a specific behavior) that they start buying and using it (bitcoin, monero)

These aren't mutually exclusive. For example, ether might appeal to people as a currency while ethereum appeals to them as a distributed computing project.

Also some coins are [basic templates with no engineering, theory, or invention involved that get backing (as in fiat investment) via meme fads and tiktok influencers](https://goto.etherscan.com/address/0x95ad61b0a150d79219dcf64e1e6cc01f0b64c4ce#code) but assumedly that's not what you're talking about.",2021-05-23 09:05:05

theviktorious1,"Perhaps fiat was not the best example. My main confusion was about the &gt;100% collateral. I came across a Q&amp;A where BlockFi team brought up an example with 120% fiat collateral (below). And my understanding is that MakerDAO is at 150% collateral (but not sure if fiat can be used as collateral to borrow DAI). 

https://coincentral.com/blockfi-review/

What happens if suddenly everyone defaults on their cryptocurrency loans?:  “When we lend crypto assets to generate yield, we have an extremely thorough risk management and credit analysis process. We only primarily lend to large, well-capitalized, institutional borrowers, or to counter-parties willing to post collateral and provide the ability to margin call them on a 24/7 basis.”  

“What that means is, if we are lending $1M worth of BTC to Firm XYZ, Firm XYZ collateralizes the loan (typically ~120%) by giving us ~$1.2M USD. If the loan were to then enter margin call and the borrower was unable to provide additional collateral (default), we would use their USD collateral to buy crypto.”",2021-05-23 11:58:16

dEEtoooo,"rETH can be used like any other ERC20 token and can sit in any ETH wallet.  I plan to hold mine in my Ledger wallet.  It can be used in defi (decentralized finance) for lending, liquidity pools, or collateral purposes, etc.  Something like Uniswap or MakerDAO.  You can make profits like this to fund your LLC if you can somehow tie your rETH assets to an LLC under its control of the wallet keys, yeah that makes sense.  But a traditional bank would not hold the rETH for you - at least I've never heard of that.

richardsaganIII,"one of the appeals of mkr is that it counterbalances dai - there is a burn system in place so as the system generates revenues from open valuts and liquidation penalties - it buys back maker from the market and burns it from circulation - it also has a low supply cap of around 1 million tokens.

The maker community encourages people to use the token strictly for voting or delegating (if thats a thing in the mkr community, not sure of this). I am pretty sure they dont want to encourage too much defi use cases other then market making because they typically want to prevent a governance attack (think if an address borrowed a huge supply of MKR from AAVE then used that to vote on certain proposals) - anyways, alot of people like MKR for these reasons and I do too. I tend to watch the ratio for MKR/ETH - to me its the same idea of following the ratio between BTC/ETH. MKR also acts as a guard against the dai peg

Other than voting - i just keep the token in my wallet - but the way it counterbalances multicollateral dai is pretty cool.

SlugThugtorious,"Taken from a comment on that article that says it better than I could:

“Here’s a summary of this article:
Interpret the word “contract” only in the classical legal sense and ignore dApps and decentralized protocols. Note that decentralized smart contracts are less flexible than legal contracts that have humans interpreting/enforcing them. Pretend this is a drawback of contracts in layer 1.
Assert that people will enter into contracts on Lightning Network in the future instead of using the existing legal system (but don’t explain WHY they’d ever do that). Point out that lightning network settles on the blockchain only in the case of dispute. Pretend this solves the inflexibility issue mentioned earlier (but again don’t explain how in any way). Don’t mention that Ethereum also has Raiden &amp; payment channels that can do the same thing.
&lt;/end summary&gt;
Bitcoin could never implement protocols like Compound &amp; MakerDAO without introducing trust assumptions that defeat the whole purpose of decentralization.”",2021-05-24 04:02:30
salientecho,"&gt; To your point, though, the token is not the business. It's not the thing that generates value. It's the thing that is used as the fuel for things that generate value.

anything used to generate value will gain derivative value, and crypto ecosystems have substantial moats—reimplementation &amp; maintenance of a dapp (distributed application) on a different blockchain is a substantial undertaking.

and they *may* be the business or the thing that generates value. tokens could be imbued with any kind of functionality the developers can implement:

- the token may *actually* be the business: used for governance in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) tokens grant permissions for various functions, and votes on proposals and protocol changes.

- pools of tokens may be staked to ensure that protocol stability / security, verifying new blocks of transactions. those that come to concensus are rewarded with block rewards, those that do not (attacking or corrupt nodes) will have their stake slashed. 


- they can send the owner other tokens as a kind of dividend; MakerDAO will issue new mintings of stablecoin Dai to Maker holders.

- they may represent debt obligations; tokens issued to creditors are a transparent &amp; fungible accounting of equity. this is particularly useful for vendors &amp; customers of the issuer: they may exchange tokens among themselves, redeem them in lieu of fiat for issuer goods / services. at any time the total equity / dilution can be audited by investors. often, holding or spending tokens may convey discounts on the issuer's goods / services.


&gt; So what is stopping the devs from pushing out a new feature that accepts other coins or fiat?

on-ramps to fiat and other coins reduces friction, thereby increasing value of the native token. this is a sign of ecosystem maturity.

it's not possible to run a protocol on another form of gas; the native token and the application are as inextricable as a public company and their stock ticker.

what can be done is ""wrapping"" wherein coin A can be sent to a designated address on coin A blockchain, and a smart contract on coin B will mint a ""wrapped"" version of A. the wrapped token is then an A-backed token that can be burned / redeemed at any time for the original asset, but now can be used in anything protocol B is capable of. the wrapping function will often have its own token that it will require as an incidental fee for the cross-chain exchange.

e.g., Bitcoin doesn't natively support smart contracts, so Ren wraps Bitcoin, and then it can be used like any token on Ethereum.",2021-05-24 05:25:46

It does makes sense as Ether is a ""lingua franca"" between tons of applications and use cases in a single ecosystem.  Not that is necessarily has to be, but it makes sense as such.  I think the strongest example of this is MakerDAO.  When it started you collateralized Ether to create SAI.  This is 100% treating Ether as a store of value to get a more useful day-to-day stable value transaction coin.  BCH can totally do this as well but the ecosystem needs to catch up to ethereum's maturity.  I used to worry about Ether's price as it seemed like the end goal was just to be gas for other better projects.  But there is also value in the underpinning monetary value that makes things like Maker work.  


I would argue that Ether is a better store of value than BTC because it creates its own relevance instead of being dependent on the grown up table noticing what a special boy it has been all this time.  That is also one of the reasons I think BCH has more long term relevance than BTC.

## FAQ

1. *I don't see any links!* Often spammers will submit the post, and upvote it with alt accounts, and wait for it to get traction before posting the link.  Or, they won't post a link directly in comments but will PM or chat message anyone who comments with a link. **If you think this is a false-positive, please comment and a human will review.**

1. *How do you know they're a scammer?* Typical red flags are newer accounts with few or simple comments, but some scammers build or buy faux-accounts to avoid detection. The best thing you can do is avoid clicking on any links that don't go to a site you're familiar with, **especially** if the link seems to come from nowhere or is from a new / low karma account.

1. *How do you know in this specific case?* Unfortunately publishing all red flags would make it easier for the scammers to hide.  If you have a question, reply to this comment and the bot's operator will respond when they are able.

1. *But someone else posted the link, not OP* Scammers will use multiple accounts to look more innocent. They also use multiple accounts to upvote posts and comments to look more supported / show higher in browsing listings.

1. *I see links to Twitter, Imgur, Google, Linkedin, and other sites. are those safe?* The link itself, yes. HOWEVER those links will most likely then redirect you to ANOTHER link that has the shirt for ""sale"". Scammers use this tactic to avoid Reddit blacklisting their scammy domain names.

MerkleChainsaw,"I'm pretty new to MakerDAO myself so I'd recommend reading this sub's Wiki. It has some great info.

The shortest answer I can give is:

DAI is the product. It's always worth $1, and its the only stablecoin that's both decentralized and collateralized. You can use it to transfer value, create leverage by minting it, earn interest in a decentralized savings account, and other uses.

MKR is similar to stock shares and doesn't have utility on its own. It receives excess fee revenue from the system but it also takes on the most risk and can have its value wiped out (through dilution) if the system has major shortfalls.",2021-05-26 23:22:36

However, you won't get your $1000 of ETH back until you pay back the $200 of DAI (obviously, it won't be denominated in USD but ETH and DAI respectively). 

This is crypto, in many cases the buck stops at you. No one in defi is gonna run a credit check on you, but the smart contract is set up in such a way that if you royally fuck up then your original collateral is forfeit and can be used to give more loans.",2021-05-27 02:44:53

Bones has a fixed supply of 250,000,000 and will be the bigger long term investment opportunity, all the way up until they’ve minted the whole 250mill. Because they’ll keep 66% of Shiba staked, it’ll allow Shiba to rise rapidly.  Once Shiba reaches $1, it will become the stable coin for ShibaSwap and remain at $1 forever after. Bones will be the crypto to have after that but, everyone investing in Shiba now, and holding, will be the short term winners. If you do a close read you’ll see they have a setup extremely similar to Maker and MakerDao. There’s also reason to believe Bones will be like yearn.finance coin (which is worth more than Bitcoin at the moment). RocketCrypto has some very informative, well thought, and fact based YouTube videos about this. It will go up in the next year or two because of how they’re setting ShibaSwap up.

CrushHazard,"I think one of the issues is that you think of them as currencies when in reality they are definitely assets but not necessarily currencies. 

One of the most intriguing models out there is MakerDAO. It’s actually two tokens: one is called DAI, which currently (but not necessarily forever) tracks to USD. DAI is the currency used to make the financial transactions — the connection to our world, so to speak. The other is MKR, which is the currency used to pay the “oracles” (human beings who review and confirm the financial transactions). 

In a way, you can see DAI as the “currency” and MKR as the equity investment in the idea. 

Think of this scenario: you want to sell your house. You could do it the traditional way, paying 2% to a broker. But you have heard of a way to sell your home and pay transaction fees of $1,000 instead of $10,000. The website has stellar reviews. You go for it. 

The transaction is filled out in a form and converted into a “smart contract”. Before, during and after escrow of “oracles” review the transaction for accuracy in the same way an escrow agent would. The buyer’s money is converted into DAI,a portion of that DAI is converted into MKR which is used to pay the oracles for their trouble, the remainder gets converted back into dollars before reaching your bank account, and as with any escrowed transaction, the buyer ends up with the deed. 

Everything happens the same way a regular real estate transaction does except that instead of one person certifying the transaction, hundreds do. It’s well known that any time you move away from what people are used to (especially for financial transactions) it needs to be much safer. I think this meets that requirement. 

The value of crypto is not all that different from the value of online stock trading, automated car building or streaming over video rentals. More convenient, more efficient, less middlemen, and cheaper. 

It’s the natural progression of things. You could argue that traditional banks will compete with crypto, but I don’t see that happening. Crypto is as lean as it gets. It’s impossible to undercut it. You can only market against it, which is what we see from the banks now, even as they invest in it.",2021-05-27 15:19:37

&gt; MakerDAO's collateralization ratio stays around ~250%, the price of Ether sits idle at ~$150 for the remainder of the year, and the liquid supply is ~108M ETH. In addition, for the sake of simplicity for our projections, we assume that Ether makes up 100% of the collateralized assets for Dai. Given the current climate with Argentina's financial system, let's say Dai is widely successful and captures 51% of the Argentine M1 supply, resulting in a circulating supply of 13.58B DAI. Assuming the above collateralization ratio and the current price of ETH at ~$150, the MakerDAO system would need 226.4M ETH locked in order to supply the 13.58B Dai. Lastly, to bring the required ETH locked into the ballpark of today's consumption rate, let's say ~3.7% of total bandwidth, the price of ETH would have to surpass $250,000 with total trustless economic bandwidth reaching $27T. That's a 1,665x increase from today's ~$16.2B market cap.

MaltoonYezi,"Decentralized Finance. It heavily focuses on blockchain.  


I won't go don't to specifics, but the most prominent case of DeFi business usage is decentralized crypto exchanges. Although it is not limited only to the extent of Cryptocurrency exchanges.  


Simply put. There are 2 types of cryptocurrency exchanges.  
1. Centralized exchange (CeFi) - All the orders are being placed and managed through a central exchange, whom you trust to give you the crypto, and store your funds (if you don't transfer your crypto to your wallet). Common examples of CeFi exchanges are Binance and Coinbase  


2. Decentralized exchange (DeFi) - There is no exchange, but rather a system of smart contracts hosted on a blockchain network. Only the users and smart contracts (programmed algorithms) are being involved in executing (the so-called swaps- which are simply orders that allow you to exchange crypto with someone else). No other 3rd party involved.  
  
The DeFi technology is a pretty recent one and is currently in rapid development right now. The earliest signs of DeFi trace back to 2013, when Vitalik Buterin published a paper called ""F next-generation smart contract &amp; decentralized application platform"".  (not counting the 2009's bitcoin, because in this case, DeFi serves as a subset of blockchain technology as a whole rather than a separate technology).   


How, can you play DeFi hype?  
  
I found only one potential DeFi play that could be considered. It is that Argo Blockchain founders to launching DeFi IPO on Aquis Stock Exchange, but I didn't do much research on this one  
  
It is probably too early to tell who is going to IPO, and what are the major plays in the industry

cryptOwOcurrency,"That's a great question. Here is what would need to change about Cardano for me to become comfortable with it as an investment, in no particular order:

* Me getting straight, understandable answers to questions I've been asking about the limitations of Cardano's EUTxO model, which I asked about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoDevelopers/comments/myeodg/how_does_writing_a_dex_in_plutus_work/) in April, and which SandaeSwap [wrote about in their whitepaper](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nqdun4/daily_general_discussion_june_2_2021/h0a4g8t/).

* Me getting straight, understandable answers to questions I've been asking about Cardano's fee model under full L1 load, [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoDevelopers/comments/myeodg/how_does_writing_a_dex_in_plutus_work/gvvnjjx/) and in countless other threads I've commented in.

* Me getting straight, understandable answers to why native tokens are functionally superior to Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens. Everything I have read about it is either hand-wavey, or talks about how it's hard and error-prone for developers to copy-paste the ERC-20 templates (bs), or talks about how Cardano's token transfers don't cost any more than its native transfers (which doesn't matter if ALL types of transfers are very cheap.)

* Seeing Cardano adopt a scaling solution with better data availability guarantees than Hydra, which requires all interested parties to be online and active in order to arbitrate, similar to Lightening Network's ""watch towers"". Zk and optimistic rollups are one idea (like Ethereum), on-chain execution sharding is another (like Polkadot), data sharding with some extra transaction ordering guarantees are another (like Solana), a native zero-knowledge L1 is another (like Mina). Cardano is pursuing none of those avenues publicly, instead sticking with their outdated 2015 state channel tech.

* Significant amounts of liquidity migrating to Cardano. Whales who are liquidity farming on Ethereum just don't have an incentive to fragment their liquidity by moving to Cardano. It's a chicken and egg. I'll keep my eyes open for some clever tokenomics solution, but I don't have my fingers crossed.

* Significant amounts of *grassroots* projects migrating to Cardano. It doesn't matter how *many* projects, the only thing that matters is the big players. When Uniswap, MakerDAO, or Compound - or other companies that similarly command billions of dollars of volume and TVL - migrate to Cardano, I'll start taking a second look.

* IOHK starting to be more forthcoming about the limitations of their technology. As I mentioned before, the always-online requirement of Hydra. The concentration of stake into multiple pools owned by the same owner (e.g. dozens of binance pools). The compromises an AMM DEX has to make to run under the EUTxO model. Being straightforward that the ""ERC-20 Converter"" does NOT do any ""conversion"" whatsoever, it's a BRIDGE, and rename it ""ERC-20 Bridge"" so that it's clear it is the same thing that a bunch of other chains have.

* Smart money starting to take Cardano seriously. ADA had its big day in the sun when it entered the top 10 in 2017, but it's still nowhere on the radar of institutions, silicon valley, or VC-backed startups compared to Ethereum. Cardano is designed for and marketed to retail investors, not institutions or developers, and the lack of real institutional interest compared to Ethereum shows this very clearly.

* A Web3/Metamask-like way to interact with smart contracts through web interfaces via a browser extension and mobile app. This is critical for users to be able to use smart contracts, otherwise Cardano is going to go through some miserable days like Ethereum went through in 2016-2017, when you had to manually invoke functions on smart contracts through MyEtherWallet to get anything done. Huge pain in the ass.

* Being more honest about comparing either Cardano's *present* to Ethereum's *present*, or Cardano's *future* to Ethereum's *future*. A lot of the time, Cardano's future gets compared to Ethereum's present, and that's really unfair to Ethereum. Cardano's future 1M tx/sec gets compared to Ethereum's current 15 tx/sec instead of its future 100k tx/sec with sharding and rollups. Cardano's future multi-language smart contract support gets compared to Ethereum's current Solidity-only support (which isn't even true, since Ethereum supports Vyper too.) Cardano's future gain in market share is compared to Ethereum's current market share, not the bigger and bigger market share it's likely to pick up over the next few years, etc.

* Being more honest about how Ethereum's lack of on-chain governance is a deliberate choice based on Vitalik's viewpoints, and how Cardano's on-chain governance is a divergence from those viewpoints to create a blockchain that has a different philosophy. Right now it's touted as a ""straight upgrade"" rather than a difference in philosophy. It also doesn't exist yet, tying into the previous point.

* In general, having better technical resources. I still haven't seen an easy, straightforward tutorial for how to set up a Plutus dev environment and publish a ""Hello World"" contract to the Alonzo testnet. Compare that to Ethereum where there's about a million tutorials on how to test and publish a smart contract on Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Nintendo Wii and your microwave oven.

* Either Cardano's technology catching up to justify its ridiculously large market cap, or the market cap lowering to meet the current state of its tech. There are other chains like Solana that have working products with a lot more technically impressive innovations than Cardano but are worth 1/10th of what ADA is right now. ADA is by far the most frothy crypto in the top 5. Even though it's not launched yet, all of its potential future growth is already priced in for some reason. There really isn't a lot more room for Cardano to run, because its run has already been *massive*.

These are a few of the things that would need to change in order for me to admit I am wrong about Cardano being a good investment looking towards the future. Right now, way too many of my questions are going unanswered about it. Unanswered on IOHK's website, unanswered in the Cardano Devs subreddit, and unanswered by any blog article or other resource I've been able to find on Google.

Because so many of my questions have gone unanswered for so long, at some point I am forced to assume that good answers simply don't exist. Otherwise someone, somewhere, would have written *something* that would have been picked up by Google, or someone around here would know something about and be able to point me in the right direction to get them answered.",2021-06-03 06:42:20

richards_86,"Since you're in the Maker forum, I'll answer the question in relation to MakerDao and not all of DeFi in general (although it's generally the same principles).

Maker charges a stability fee (like an interest rate on a loan) on the amount of DAI a vault holder mints. So basically someone deposits collateral, mints DAI (takes a loan), and then the system keeps track of the stability fee debt outstanding based on time. When the vault holder comes back to unlock their collateral they need to pay the original DAI amount borrowed, plus the outstanding stability fee amount. The earned stability fee is then injected back into the MKR token.

VandyILL,"Starting off with a reply to my own post :)

I had been lurking in the MakerDAO Reddit in 2016.  In early 2017 someone from the Radix community came over to ask about how Maker’s Dai stablecoin stacked up against Radix’s stablecoin (that they intended at the time).

Dug into what was available on Radix and loved Dan’s approach to identifying the problem and then iterating through solutions (even if it took 8 years :) )

Have been following the project since and was stoked to buy some eXRD in the past year.

Writing this made me think of these quotes (can’t verify legitimacy of them) which sum up the Radix problem solving strategy (IMO):

“If I had an hour to solve a problem I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions” - Albert Einstein 

“If you gave me an hour to chop down a tree I’d spend the first 55 minutes sharpening my ax” -Abraham Lincoln",2021-06-04 12:04:23

conflicted_luddite,"Here's what OP posted be he removed:

&gt;Here is what would need to change about Cardano for me to become comfortable with it as an investment, in no particular order:

&gt; * Me getting straight, understandable answers to questions I've been asking about the limitations of Cardano's EUTxO model.

&gt; * Me getting straight, understandable answers to questions I've been asking about Cardano's fee model under full L1 load

&gt; * Me getting straight, understandable answers to why native tokens are functionally superior to Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens. Everything I have read about it is either hand-wavey, or talks about how it's hard and error-prone for developers to copy-paste the ERC-20 templates (bs), or talks about how Cardano's token transfers don't cost any more than its native transfers (which doesn't matter if ALL types of transfers are very cheap.)

&gt; * Seeing Cardano adopt a scaling solution with better data availability guarantees than Hydra, which requires all interested parties to be online and active in order to arbitrate, similar to Lightening Network's ""watch towers"". Zk and optimistic rollups are one idea (like Ethereum), on-chain execution sharding is another (like Polkadot), data sharding with some extra transaction ordering guarantees are another (like Solana), a native zero-knowledge L1 is another (like Mina). Cardano is pursuing none of those avenues publicly, instead sticking with their outdated 2015 state channel tech.

&gt; * Significant amounts of liquidity migrating to Cardano. Whales who are liquidity farming on Ethereum just don't have an incentive to fragment their liquidity by moving to Cardano. It's a chicken and egg. I'll keep my eyes open for some clever tokenomics solution, but I don't have my fingers crossed.

&gt; * Significant amounts of grassroots projects migrating to Cardano. It doesn't matter how many projects, the only thing that matters is the big players. When Uniswap, MakerDAO, or Compound - or other companies that similarly command billions of dollars of volume and TVL - migrate to Cardano, I'll start taking a second look.

&gt; * IOHK starting to be more forthcoming about the limitations of their technology. As I mentioned before, the always-online requirement of Hydra. The concentration of stake into multiple pools owned by the same owner (e.g. dozens of binance pools). The compromises an AMM DEX has to make to run under the EUTxO model. Being straightforward that the ""ERC-20 Converter"" does NOT do any ""conversion"" whatsoever, it's a BRIDGE, and rename it ""ERC-20 Bridge"" so that it's clear it is the same thing that a bunch of other chains have.

&gt; * Smart money starting to take Cardano seriously. ADA had its big day in the sun when it entered the top 10 in 2017, but it's still nowhere on the radar of institutions, silicon valley, or VC-backed startups compared to Ethereum. Cardano is designed for and marketed to retail investors, not institutions or developers, and the lack of real institutional interest compared to Ethereum shows this very clearly.

&gt; * A Web3/Metamask-like way to interact with smart contracts through web interfaces via a browser extension and mobile app. This is critical for users to be able to use smart contracts, otherwise Cardano is going to go through some miserable days like Ethereum went through in 2016-2017, when you had to manually invoke functions on smart contracts through MyEtherWallet to get anything done. Huge pain in the ass.

&gt; * Being more honest about comparing either Cardano's present to Ethereum's present, or Cardano's future to Ethereum's future. A lot of the time, Cardano's future gets compared to Ethereum's present, and that's really unfair to Ethereum. Cardano's future 1M tx/sec gets compared to Ethereum's current 15 tx/sec instead of its future 100k tx/sec with sharding and rollups. Cardano's future multi-language smart contract support gets compared to Ethereum's current Solidity-only support (which isn't even true, since Ethereum supports Vyper too.) Cardano's future gain in market share is compared to Ethereum's current market share, not the bigger and bigger market share it's likely to pick up over the next few years, etc.

&gt; * Being more honest about how Ethereum's lack of on-chain governance is a deliberate choice based on Vitalik's viewpoints, and how Cardano's on-chain governance is a divergence from those viewpoints to create a blockchain that has a different philosophy. Right now it's touted as a ""straight upgrade"" rather than a difference in philosophy. It also doesn't exist yet, tying into the previous point.

&gt; * In general, having better technical resources. I still haven't seen an easy, straightforward tutorial for how to set up a Plutus dev environment and publish a ""Hello World"" contract to the Alonzo testnet. Compare that to Ethereum where there's about a million tutorials on how to test and publish a smart contract on Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Nintendo Wii and your microwave oven.

&gt; * Either Cardano's technology catching up to justify its ridiculously large market cap, or the market cap lowering to meet the current state of its tech. There are other chains like Solana that have working products with a lot more technically impressive innovations than Cardano but are worth 1/10th of what ADA is right now. ADA is by far the most frothy crypto in the top 5. Even though it's not launched yet, all of its potential future growth is already priced in for some reason. There really isn't a lot more room for Cardano to run, because its run has already been massive.

&gt; These are a few of the things that would need to change in order for me to admit I am wrong about Cardano being a good investment looking towards the future. Right now, way too many of my questions are going unanswered about it. Unanswered on IOHK's website, unanswered in the Cardano Devs subreddit, and unanswered by any blog article or other resource I've been able to find on Google.

&gt; Because so many of my questions have gone unanswered for so long, at some point I am forced to assume that good answers simply don't exist. Otherwise someone, somewhere, would have written something that would have been picked up by Google, or someone around here would know something about and be able to point me in the right direction to get them answered.

Compound has some advantages: 

- it has been battle-tested. Compound is older than just about anything else in defi save for MakerDAO.

- it limits risk significantly. Supply and demand are directly linked through Compound itself, and only through Compound itself. Each money market is also contained, so anything happening with USDC affects you none if you're borrowing/lending DAI.

If you compare Compound with Curve for example, Curve offers much higher APYs but also exposes you to significantly more risk. If a token becomes near worthless in a Curve pool, it will be acquired at the expense of other tokens until the LP itself is worthless.

vuduchyld,"I agree with those below who say zoom out just a little bit.  

Don't consider me a credible source on this, but I think I read somewhere that some of the team recently had some lockups expire, which may have put quite a few MATIC in play on exchanges and generated some available supply.  May not be true.  I can't find that or cite it.  But it may be true...click on the 1-month view here: [https://www.viewbase.com/coin/matic-network](https://www.viewbase.com/coin/matic-network)

But that is short term.  As for the L2/DeFi issue, I think Polygon will do well with retail DeFi.  Institutions are definitely going to be more interested by the security of Arbitrum/Optimism, but if BSC proved one thing, it's that there is a ton of retail demand for inexpensive and fast DeFi.  I tend to believe that even with L2s, 2.0, and everything we know is coming, scaling will be an issue for quite some time.  

I actually like some of the DeFi options on Polygon.  One can choose established players, such as Aave and Curve.  Unlike Alpha or 1Inch, they never went to BSC.  This gives Polygon at least a little bit of legitimacy.  Those teams are really fucking good and smart.  There are also some novel options available.  Mai Finance is at least prima facie similar to MakerDAO.  You can collateralize MATIC, borrow a MiMATIC stablecoin, and use that to farm or buy more crypto.  

I'm not fixing to sell off ETH for MATIC.  (Maybe Bitcoin, though!)  ETH wears the crown.  I deployed a bit of new capital to BSC back in February, though, and I am glad I did.  I've since deployed a bit more new capital and re-deployed BSC capital to MATIC.  If nothing else, it's a worthwhile testnet.  I'm a bit of an experiential learner, and I like being able to move in (AND OUT) of positions with some capital efficiency.",2021-06-07 01:04:46
vuduchyld,"I can't in all good conscience recommend these, because I don't know enough about them, really.  I'm just kind of screwing around with a little bit of capital, because that's how I learn.  DYOR DYOR please please DYOR!

* Both Aave and Curve are on Polygon.  I haven't looked at all the offerings in a while, but as I recall, there was a Polygon option that looked like 3Crv with 5-6% returns on your stables plus 15-20% returns in WMATIC.
* Mai Finance is similar, I think, to MakerDAO.  You can deposit MATIC into a vault, then borrow a MiMATIC stablecoin.  They have a few farming options that allow you to earn the QiDAO token, Qi.  That Qi token has recently had a run up in price from around 50 cents to around 80 cents, so that farming reward ends up being pretty substantial.  You can pool MiMATIC/USDC for farming pure stables to Qi or MiMATIC/Qi.
* My favorite aggregator is Adamant Finance.  I'm looking at their website right now, and it seems too good to be true...SO IT PROBABLY IS.  The rewards on stables are outrageously high.  I've got a couple of different stable combos running, including FRAX/USDC on Sushi and DAI/USDC on QuickSwap.
* Maybe somebody like u/LogrisTheBard can tell me what I'm missing, here, but Adamant TVL has jumped from under $100mm to about $130mm in maybe 48 hours.  Keep in mind...some of the rewards come from their ADDY token (not all...and it depends on the pool).  But the market cap of the token is less than $20mm.  They show monthly profits to stakers of the token at more than $4mm.  EDIT: and like the Qi token, the ADDY token has run pretty wild the last 48 hours...up from $34 to $57.
* So market cap to TVL is an absurdly low 0.15...and even assuming no growth in TVL or profits, they would be generating $50mm per year in profits that get paid to $19mm worth of hodlers....so 2.5x cash flow to cap?  How could that even be true in this universe?  Of course, the ADDY token, like the Qi token, has jumped from $34 to $57 just over the course of this weekend, so maybe it's true and people are catching on to it?

DYOR, DYOR, DYOR.  I don't think Curve is going to be rugging you.  Adamant has an audit, at least, but that shit ain't worth much judging by all the BSC rugs lately.  I will tell you point blank that if I get rugged, I will shrug my shoulders and sigh, but I am NOT risking any capital here that I can't afford to walk away from.

da-future-is-bright,"&gt;I mean you saw the absolute meltdown the community had over somebody uploading a rainbow logo. Extend that out to further hypotheticals with Voltaire.

What do non-crypto political disagreements have to do with Cardano governance?

&gt;Credible neutrality

&gt;Legitimacy is the most valuable commodity in cryptoeconomics, even though it’s invisible.

How can Ethereum governance be credibly neutral when the supermajority of stakeholders in the system have little-to-no voice in decision-making?

We've seen the censorship that plagues r/Bitcoin, CT, etc. Relying on social-media polling isn't a reliable-enough way to gauge sentiment for governing multi-billion dollar decentral financial platforms.

If a large portion of the Ethereum community:

- A) wanted to fire the existing core developers

- B) strongly disagreed with design choices / wanted to pivot in X way

- C) wanted to fund new protocol research

How would they go about doing that?

A / B are probably possible, but it would require rebelling against the core developers to such a large degree that the price would implode.

People were vocal about the EF's general inaction for a long time, but there wasn't much anyone could do about it, as they are beholden to nobody.

Cardano governance + treasury will allow the community as a whole to:

- hire / fire developers at will, based on past performance and transparency

- fund meaningful RnD / projects

- steer the platform in the right directions, instead of ossifying and dying in a ditch

After governance is implemented, IOHK/etc must submit funding proposals to the Cardano community. Can't get more accountability than that.

Research is also being done for Proof-of-Merit/other systems to further decentralize governance beyond mere stake-weight

Keep in mind Cardano governance isn't just: '51% of active stake can implement protocol changes' - there is deliberate separation of infrastructure and governance

There will be protocol politicians (much like MakerDAO/etc are planning to use) so instead of counting worthless followers/likes, we can see how much ADA is delegated to reputable researchers, developers and influencers.",2021-06-10 02:44:46

If you own maker then you’re involved in the business of supporting the system and you’re able to reap the benefits of the revenue that is generated and you’re also able to benefit from the burning feature which should (in theory and so far in practice) reduce the supply of Maker coin and therefore increase the value of it.

Revanchist1,"For most well made projects and dApps, the documentation is usually the best place to learn about all the key parts. 

https://alchemix-finance.gitbook.io/alchemix-finance/

Most documentations are explained simply but may take multiple reads to fully comprehend how the systems work.

The Transmuter plays a major role in trying to maintaing the peg. The yield from the deposited Dai (earned via Yearn Finance Dai vault) is sent to the Transmuter contract. When you deposit alUSD into the Transmuter, you will be able to withdraw Dai at the 1:1 peg. The alUSD is burnt and Dai is distributed.

Things get more complicated though. 
u/LogrisTheBard 's posts explains it great.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nr5cic/daily_general_discussion_june_3_2021/h0htw0t?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3

But due to some whales wanting to farm efficiently without incurring Slippage, there is a significant amount of Dai (permanently-ish) locked in the Transmuter which is earning yield for all users of Alchemix. Effectively boosting the interest earned on everyone deposits.

Another aspect is the arbritage opportunity. If alUSD loses its peg (alUSD worth less than Dai), you can swap alUSD via curve and deposit the cheap alUSD in the Transmuter to recieve the 1 alUSD:1 Dai. However by using the Transmuter, you are reducing the total amount of Dai in the system that is being used to yield farm. Which means you are reducing the effective yield of Alchemix Dai Vault for everyone. 


The ideas is simple but complicated systems have emerged from them.


MakerDao, Yearn finance, Alchemix, Curve Finance, Uniswap (AMM) These are the main systems that people new to the space should read up on. And you can get the best info from their documentations.",2021-06-10 05:22:19

Beechbone22,"Liquity isn't a lending protocol like AAVE or Compound. Nobody is lending stablecoins on Liquity. You create collateralized debt positions and mint an Ethereum backed algorithmic stablecoin, lUSD (Similar to the well known DAI by MakerDAO, but DAI isn't entirely collateralized by ETH but by a bunch of cryptos you can deposit to MakerDAO as collateral including other stablecoins, which is why I don't like it as much). LUSD maintains its peg to 1 dollar with a redemption feature and liquidity providers between lUSD and other stables are incentivized by pool fees paid by loan takers and arbitrageurs who maintain lUSD's dollar peg. The protocol mints lUSD, collateralized by a ratio as low as 110%. You pay an upfront 0.5% funding fee which goes to protocol token stakers. Stability providers can provide lUSD to the stability pool for the purpose of liquidations for loans below a 110% collateralization ratio, they are incentivized by protocol token emissions to do so, but more importantly they can buy ETH well below market prices during liquidations, especially if the protocol goes into recovery mode. The protocol can go into recovery mode if the global collateralization ratio drops below a certain threshold. Liquity is a very complex money market and I can't go into the nitty gritty technic details, but I like it much better than MakerDAO, AAVE and Compound to borrow long term loans. If they're shorter term, taking a loan on those platforms and paying ibterest for a short time is usually more profitable than paying Liquity's upfront fee.

dmihal,"It depends on the protocol

Fees show demand to use a protocol. Ethereum has over 4x the fee revenue of Bitcoin, meaning there's around 4x demand for Ethereum blockspace vs Bitcoin blockspace.

And then there's protocols like Uniswap, where the UNI token holders can vote to capture a share of fee revenue, and could use it to pay dividends or do token buybacks.

MakerDAO is a good example of this: MakerDAO fees are used to buy &amp; burn MKR tokens. You can follow this at https://makerburn.com/",2021-06-10 19:44:58

frank__costello,"I think people get too focused on the ""digital oil"" narrative, which misses out on the other 2 pillars of the ""triple-point asset thesis"".

It's true that ETH is a oil-like consumable asset, especially after EIP-1559 makes ETH _actually_ consumable.

The other key point of the thesis is that DeFi needs a store-of-value as collateral. Billions of dollars of ETH have been sucked into DeFi protocols like MakerDAO, Uniswap, Aave and more. This continues to grow, and make ETH a stronger store of value than Bitcoin.

Finally, ETH is a capital asset: you can stake ETH and earn yield. Billions of dollars worth of ETH are also being sucked into staking.

whenijusthavetopost,"From the Article:

&gt; Ethereum’s Role in DeFi

&gt; Decentralized finance involves the use of the blockchain in carrying out peer-to-peer financial transactions.  DeFi has ushered in a new era in finance through blockchain technology, which accomplished tasks unheard of in money markets.

&gt;Services such as Compound and Balancer allow for borrowing and lending to take place in a completely decentralized manner. Moreover, it provides a strong foundation for new financial services, which could prove to be game changers.

&gt;Ethereum is the most in-demand platform in the DeFi realm. Several Ethereum-based DeFi protocols, including Uniswap, MakerDAO, and others, have become incredibly popular.

&gt;DeFi projects have been growing rapidly, and Ethereum has facilitated their expansion. DeFi Pulse estimates that roughly $64 billion worth of DeFi projects is locked up on the Ethereum blockchain. That number had grown by over five times since January, when it was $16 billion.



I can't wait for the expansion of Defi, and with ETH 2.0 it could be majorly disrupting traditional banking and investing in the next few years.",2021-06-11 02:55:31
AusIV,"One of the problems DAI had before USDC was introduced as a collateral type was that the demand for DAI went down as ETH went up, and the demand for DAI went up as ETH went down, but the supply did the opposite.

If ETH is in a bull run, people want to use MakerDAO to leverage their positions. They collateralize ETH, borrow DAI, use the DAI to buy more ETH, collateralize that, repeat. But who's selling ETH to buy the DAI these people are selling? This puts some downward pressure on the price of DAI, as nobody really wants to buy in during a crypto bull market.

If ETH is in a bear market, people rush to deleverage their positions. They want to buy DAI back to pay off their debt so they don't get liquidated. But again, there aren't a whole lot of people looking to buy ETH while they expect the price to keep dropping - people would rather hold the stable DAI than expose themselves to the volatility of declining ETH. This can make the price of DAI rise, as nobody wants to mint DAI with ETH while that ETH is losing value.

But if you can mint DAI with USDC, this problem sorts itself out. While the price of DAI is rising during the bear market, people mint DAI with USDC and sell it for more than the USDC they bought. Other people use that DAI to deleverage their ETH-backed vaults. This keeps the price of DAI from rising too significantly, because it can be minted pretty cheaply with USDC, and if you assume DAI will eventually return to the peg you can make a profit from helping to maintain the peg. When ETH gets back into a bull market and there's a lot of people trying to leverage their ETH positions again, the demand for DAI that would have been falling can be met by people who elect to buy cheap DAI to close out the loans they took against USDC. This may mean that during a bear market they collateralize USDC to mint DAI, sell the DAI at around $1.03 (the high end of DAI being off peg), then during the next bull market they buy the DAI back at $0.97 (the low end of DAI being off peg), and pocket the $0.06 from the swing. The stability fees for USDC are really low, so they end up with a decent profit.",2021-06-11 05:40:01

FaceDeer,"This is a thing that I think often gets overlooked in the drive for decentralization. Just any old decentralization isn't necessarily a good idea, we want people who are actually aware of how the system works to be involved in the process.

I remember way back in the day when the TheDAO DAO got big I could tell it was going to have problems because right after the giant initial sale the subreddit was flooded with people posting ""Woohoo, I've bought TheDAO tokens! What do I do with them? How do I make them turn into more money for me now?"" I figured that TheDAO's only hope was to split off an ""actually knows what they're doing"" child DAO to do the actual work that TheDAO had been intended to perform. Turned out to be moot, of course. In the case of MakerDAO there isn't a similar mechanism for splitting it up into new child DAOs so here's hoping most of the people who buy in either know what they're doing or know that they should abstain from pulling the various levers exposed to them.",2021-06-12 00:55:23

On the other hand risk isolated lending/ borrowing pairs like on Sushiswap Kashi the drawback is the low liquidity in high risk pools.

Lender mentioned something about Chaffa down payment programs which help you pay 4% of the total home loan value which sounds similar to what you just described, but I would never yolo that loan after the down payment is set into DeFI.

Beechbone22,"I like LUSD better though it has nowhere near the supply that DAI has. I expect the supply to increase dramatically as more and more people lock in ETH in Liquity. Most of the collateral backing DAI is custodial stable assets like USDT and USDC. LUSD is fully collateralized by ETH. Also, MakerDAO can be changed to accept different assets as collateral in the future, introducing more systemic risk. Liquity has no governance. The protocol is a completed work and will never change. LUSD will always be fully backed by ETH. There is of course risk of LUSD losing its peg but the protocol handles liquidations much more efficiently than MakerDAO IMO.

&gt; Below, seven of the most common Dai myths are addressed in detail. While it's true that Dai can be generated using centralized tokens, such as USDC, USDT, TUSD, and PAX, those collateral assets don't make Dai any less decentralized. Increasing SFs are responses to Dai trading below $1. When Dai trades higher than $1, SFs are decreased to lower the cost of generating Dai.

I don't think I'd feel comfortable recommending you to put your whole bag in there. The docs.yearn.finance FAQ [says itself](https://docs.yearn.finance/resources/faq#is-it-safe-to-invest-money-in-yearn):

&gt;Is it safe to invest money in Yearn?
&gt;Please do your own research and decide for yourself.

So I think it's clear the developers know it's far from risk-free. The thing about Yearn is that you have not only the smart contract risk with Yearn itself but also with all the underlying smart contracts from Sushi, Curve, Pickle etc.

If it were my ETH what I might do is lock it in a MakerDAO CDP then take out a loan which I would use to buy stETH and deposit that in Yearn. I'd be gaining more slowly, but this way even if there were a problem with Yearn my ETH would still be safe.

But ehm, you can actually already do this. Today. Just not on the BTC chain. You’d have to tokenize your BTC on that other chain, lock it as collateral in MakerDAO and mint DAI. That DAI is extra liquidity that might be very useful as you don’t incur capital gains taxes on minting and burning against collateral. It’s not trading.

frozengrandmatetris,"no, it's controlled by a private company in meatspace. you give them a dollar and they give you a USDT with the pinky promise that they will buy it back from you someday. charlie is comparing the research to the smart contract MakerDAO, which manages the algorithmic stablecoin known as DAI.",2021-06-18 20:45:58
ArcadesOfAntiquity,"Let's talk about MakerDAO.

I have a positive opinion of MakerDAO. I had a CDP there for over a year and I'd have every confidence in it were I to open another at some point, which I'll probably do.

The question I have in my mind about Maker recently is, wouldn't it make sense to reward users for 

a) incurring stability fees? Perhaps with a token.

b) repaying their loan / not getting liquidated? Perhaps with some mechanism akin to a ""credit rating"", or with a token which could be cashed in to acquire a lower stability fee for a period of time in the future.

You can read about what currently happens to stability fees on [Maker's site](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/vaults/stability-fees/):

&gt;Where Stability Fees Go
&gt;Stability Fees are collected inside the Maker Protocol’s internal balance sheet. Once the maximum level of surplus is reached, the system automatically sends Dai to a Surplus Auction. During this auction, Keepers bid in MKR for DAI. Dai is released to the winning bidder while the MKR paid by the winner gets burned.

I like it, it's very serious-minded. Reading my suggestion, people might retort ""Maker is really trying to be serious. They aren't into this flashy yield farming reward token stuff. They are the bullet proof foundational money lego in defi."" Fair enough. But...

Accepting USDT and USDC as collateral makes it harder for me to see MakerDAO as such a serious-minded outfit. I guess it was just the way governance votes turned out so it shouldn't be held against the MakerDAO team themselves... the smart contracts themselves are not made any less reliable by which collaterals are available.

TLDR, I'm cranky and I want Maker (or a competitor) to either offer rewards, or kick out USDT and USDC as collaterals.

Thank you for reading my blog.",2021-06-18 21:29:00

nikola_j,"Hey, pinch.

Unfortunately there's no way to do this, as the Trove doesn't have a give/transfer function (like a MakerDAO Vault does). Really unfortunate they left that out, but it is what it is.

If you'd want to get access to our advanced features for Liquity (boosting, repaying, anything within the recipe creator), you'd have to close an existing Trove and create a new one on your Smart Wallet.

Really not a convenient thing to do, I know. Wouldn't really expect many to want to do that, either.

By the way, just to be clear - there is NO Automation support for now. It likely won't be available until our new Automation architecture is ready, which is likely months, not weeks away.

Hope the info helps!",2021-06-19 02:02:15
nikola_j,"By the way, just a quick attempt to clarify what a Smart Wallet at DeFi Saver is.

A Smart Wallet you use at DeFi Saver is nothing else than a MakerDAO DSProxy. If you ever used MakerDAO or Reflexer (but never used DeFi Saver before) - it would mean you already have a Smart Wallet of yours.

Basically, we just call it a ""Smart Wallet"" because we thought it sounds nicer than ""DSProxy"".

A Smart Wallet or DSProxy is created and owned by your EOA (e.g. your account loaded into MetaMask or Ledger) and ownly manageable with transactions executed from that EOA.

In that sense you can see DeFi Saver sort of like an app for managing your assets on the DSProxy or Smart Wallet, it does all the needed transaction creation for you to allow you to interact with protocols such as Aave and Compound and Liquity *through* that DSProxy or Smart Wallet.

Here's an attempt at an illustration: [https://imgur.com/xSGS3dT](https://imgur.com/xSGS3dT) (will definitely check with our designer about creating a better one for future use :D )",2021-06-19 02:14:39
nikola_j,"Yep. From what  I understand, the ""airdrop"" is more rewards for migrating to their platform now, rather then rewards for any kind of historical usage.

Note that there's no way do destroy a MakerDAO Vault like it was the case with older Single-collateral Dai CDPs when closing them. They just stay there empty. If you'd really want to get rid of them for whatever reason, you could send them to 0x0, but wouldn't recommend doing that.",2021-06-19 04:33:27
nikola_j,"Hey, BrownBear!

Guess this was more of a question for the DeFi Saver discord or forum, but I hope others find the info useful, too. (For anyone interested, [here's a guide](https://forum.defisaver.com/t/converting-between-eth-a-eth-b-and-eth-c-maker-vault-types-using-the-loan-shifter/) for using the Loan Shifter to convert between different vault types.)

Now, to answer your questions:

&gt;With the markets being so volatile, I was thinking of moving my CDP from an eth vault A to an eth vault B. to take advantage of the lower collateral requirements just in case the market tanks.

Great idea, if you'd prefer not to use Repay (our option to pay back debt using deposited collateral), this is a good way to keep your position further away from liquidation as market keeps dipping.

If I do this, can I covert back from B to A once the market stabilizes for the lower stability fee?

Yes, you can. You can do that any point - two minutes after the initial switch or two months or two years. The protocol doesn't care about this. As long as the debt ceiling of the vault type you want to shift *to* isn't at 100%, you can do the shift whenever.

&gt;This is my first time using the loan shifter. Is there any thing I should be aware off? Or is it as easy as it looks.

It's as easy as it looks - but there is one thing to note, yes. The Loan Shifter currently uses Aave flash loans in the process and this means that there would be a 0.09% Aave protocol fee on the debt amount if you take this route.

However - you can do the same process, while avoiding the Aave flash loan fee. Using our Recipe Creator you can re-create the same shift, but using dYdX flash loans (which have no fees) instead of Aave.

The actions you want to put together for a Recipe to create a vault into a different sub-type of the same collateral are:

(1) Flash loan DAI from dYdX in the amount of your current debt rounded to the next whole number, (2) Pay back debt to your current MakerDAO debt, (3) Withdraw ETH from your current ETH-A Maker Vault, (4) Create a new ETH-B Vault, (5) Deposit the ETH into the new ETH-B Vault, (6) Generate DAI from the new ETH-B  Vault - the flash loaned amount and (7) Pay back the dYdX flash loan.

When put together, this ""recipe"" should look like this: [https://imgur.com/S8yDyHP](https://imgur.com/S8yDyHP)

By doing the process this way, you're avoiding all fees, except the transaction fee :)

&gt;Also if I go this route, is a new vault created or is my existing vault moved?

There's no way to change the type of an existing Maker Vault, meaning this process will create a new vault, with a new id#, yes.

Hope this helps and please let me know if I should expand more on any point!",2021-06-19 05:15:37

&gt; In brief, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is backed by, or in other words tied to, a more stable asset or commodity. The most famous example would be MakerDAO, which issues DAI. Another example, many such stablecoins rely on additional collateral tokens. If we take Iron Finance - IRON is the stablecoin, while TITAN is the collateral token.

brokemac,"I think it is because TCR is real and ECR is bullshit. Most projects are overcollateralized to account for changing price. I put up 2 Eth at $4000 total under Makerdao, borrow 2000 DAI, my debt/collateral is 2. Eth falls to $1500, my debt/collateral is 1.5. It gets too low, they liquidate because the collateral no longer exists.

The ECR allows for zero price drop to actually be collateralized. Their formula is USDC collateral over IRON supply. But that is bullshit. The truth is that if you lock up $20 worth of Titan and $80 worth of USDC, and Titan price drops by half, then 10 percent of your iron is simply not backed at all. It isn't backed by a combination of titan and usdc, it's completely unbacked.

Once you have unbacked iron, the only way to ever make that $1 peg sound again is to either hope for the price of titan to rise or to start adding greater than 100 percent collateral. Absent either of those solutions, the protocol can only afford to give 50 percent of people $1 for their iron or 100 percent of them 90 cents on the dollar. When you violate that, you need to hyperinflate titan to accommodate redemptions.

They increased TCR when Titan price fell so that over time, your percentage of unbacked iron in the total circulating supply would decrease. Except changing that is extremely sluggish.

One Layer2 implementation? Will liquidity concentrate in one or multiple places? At this nascent stage, concentration in any one particular place is unlikely due to the innovation and development happening in various ecosystems.

nikola_j,"I'm going to feel sucky if I'm saying this to someone who already knows - but hopefully it helps someone in either case:

You can clear CDP debt using collateral that's already deposited in there. We have the option available at DeFi Saver, we call it *Repay*, and it does three steps in one transaction: withdraws ETH (or whichever collateral), sells ETH for DAI (or whichever debt asset) and uses those funds to clear debt.

We actually have this available for a number of protocols now - Maker, Compound, Aave, Reflexer and Liquity.

It's a *much* better option than liquidation - with MakerDAO there's a 13% liquidation penalty, while for using a Repay at DeFi Saver there would be a 0.25% fee (and a potential 0.09% Aave protocol fee for the flash loan, though we're trying to get those reduced or we'll switch to other providers).

Though for Compound and Aave you'd have to migrate the position to a proxy wallet for these kinds of multi-step transactions to be possible, while for for Maker and Reflexer you can just login at [app.defisaver.com](https://app.defisaver.com/) and hit it, we're fully compatible with default apps in both cases.

I'm really pretty sure you know of options such as this one, though, especially since you called it a CDP in the first place. But if anyone needs any more info on this or anything, please let me know.",2021-06-23 00:40:59

Note that this can't happen in MakerDAO. Their price oracles update once per hour and with a one hour delay - meaning that righ now at the full hour there'll be a price update going through that was queued an hour ago.

And when it comes to Automation, if at any point a next price shows up and gets queued that's lower than your liquidation price, an auto-repay will be triggered based on that next price, meaning within that hour left before you can get liquidated.",2021-06-23 01:00:32

I also dislike the fact that USDC can be frozen, the government could technically freeze the USDC that are used to back DAI. I would be fine with 10% total but 55% way too high.

But DAI demand is so high without the transmuting of USDC to DAI it would constantly lose the peg.

It’s a liquidation if the “value” of your eth collateral diminished past a treshold DAI bites and puts up for sale your ETH for a discount in the auction house, and it keeps lowering it’s price until there is a buyer, this has led to basically DAI giving away ETH for free.

Imagine it’s the night and you are asleep, ETH drops and your collateral drops, you need to add collateral to stop it from liquidating (much like financial derivatives markets) but instead of having the option, DAI automatically sells your position at a discount.

GrilledCheezzy,"Okay so assuming you’ve been learning about cryptocurrencies for years I find it interesting that most of the things you find valuable about this project are all related to marketing. That’s where I get turned off by the projects posted here. They’re all the same in which marketing seems to be the most important thing to the community. That doesn’t bother you at all? Like if you’ve been a part of crypto that long then you’ll remember the last bear market. Do you recall how impactful marketing was for projects to gain value during this time period?

Also I find it interesting that not having the ability to mint tokens is a plus. It’s fairly typical that projects have a minting function. Take makerdao for example, one of the most innovative and successful projects in defi - the ability to mint dai from your cdp vault is integral to maintaining the dai peg to 1$. I do know that some projects prefer to mint tokens at one time, hold in an owner wallet or an otherwise protected wallet but in my opinion it’s better to have a minting function. You’re relying on someone to have control over a wallet holding the entire supply and that would be considered centralization in my book. There are pros and cons to either approach. But one thing I do know is that makerdao has been using the mint function for over three years without any issues so that seems like a pretry ambiguity attach vector for an exploit. 

Now so like what’s the future for ultrasafe in your opinion? Like I get that it’s Safemoon but slightly different than Safemoon. Safemoon didn’t really do anything.  They didn’t provide any real innovation to crypto except maybe some slightly interesting economic functions. Is ultrasafe implement anything different from Safemoon other than the fact that they don’t mint the tokens as needed?

I know I sound like an ass but I really am interested to find out how someone that’s been around for a few years is seeing the value in this project. I would think that you have some kind of insight along with your experience but I know most is the buyers of these kinds of tokens are typically noobs.",2021-07-01 07:15:48
Ber10,"I am reading the Maker Dao Forum from time to time. And I have to say its amazing how far DAOs have come. I dont know of many other project that has this many involved players operating on such a high level. Compound governance is more centralized.

Defi is evolving infront of our eyes. With those 3 billion usdc that the protocol owns if they put that to work... MakerDAO is like an investment company with legal teams and real world actors acting on behalf of the protocol. And I see them making the jump to the real world economy right now. The DAO is branching out who knows what they will do. Maybe one day they will buy the empire state building and rent it out while the yields are going burn MKR the building will be collateralized to print more DAI.

I really cant see where this journey is going but its fascinating to follow.

MKR COMP AAVE those DAOs are truly gamechanging. But MKR has the best way to let the yields flow to the MKR owners.

Its truly undervalued. That Dai is heavily backed by USDC might not be such a bad thing afterall. MKR holds 10%+ of all USDC. They are extremly liquid they can do with it whatever is best.

USDC and BUSD are backed by Circle and Paxos respectively(centralized), while DAI is backed by MakerDAO(decentralized).

All things considered, I'd personally consider it very safe, because they re-used Maker code and they had a test build (protoRAI) on the mainnet for months last year and the current, actual release has been live on mainnet since mid-February, with no issues and RAI holding pretty stable, even through the major crashes and all market volatility, in general.

Plus, Reflexer has the same 1-hour price oracle delay like MakerDAO has, which is super convenient.

makerdao isnt really any different with the minting of dai with an asset collateralising the loan. you have to think of DAI as a loan on the collateral. the risk params of getting liquidated are known are there are bots u can get to pay down debt or fund the collateral to avoid liquidation.

nikola_j,"Hey, saltyfinish.

CDP stands for collateralized debt position and that's the currently most common way to get loans in crypto - you deposit one asset as collateral, to borrow another.

Some of the most popular options for this have been MakerDAO, Compound and Aave, though as of recently there are also Reflexer and Liquity to consider.

As rgscg mentioned, Liquity is the most interesting option, as there are no streaming, on-going fees, just a one time borrowing fee at the moment you take the loan.

We actually just added Liquity to DeFi Saver like two weeks ago, so perhaps consider reading this [intro post on the DFS blog](https://medium.com/defi-saver/liquity-is-live-in-defi-saver-should-you-consider-switching-fa3d4584b6d0) if interested (there's a bit of a comparison with MakerDAO in there, too).

Please feel free to page me if there's anything more I can help with (disclaimer: I'm from the DFS team) and if you're thinking about going with DeFi Saver, keep in mind you have the Simulation mode available, so you can try any of these processes in a simulated environment before committing actual funds.

nikola_j,"To answer this specifically - you can use MakerDAO through DeFi Saver, yes.

You'll be interacting with the same MakerDAO protocol and in the same way as in their default (Oasis) app. We stick to using standard Maker architecture based around dsproxy\* which means you can switch between DFS and Oasis at any point in time, just by loging in one app or the other.

\*Dsproxy is the standard proxy smart contract wallet that's been used by MakerDAO for years now. You create it with your account, and your account is its sole owner and manager. Having the CDP/Vault sitting on the dsproxy enables running complex transactions on that position with any number of different smart contract interactions, whereas you would be greatly limited if the CDP was sitting directly on your standard account. I tried making [a simple illustration](https://imgur.com/xSGS3dT) to explain how that works (especially at DFS where use the dsproxy for all supported protocols).

Possible-Event-9640,"&gt;so ud have to divide that with the total amount in the pool to figure our your %return\*365 as a guestimate

Basically you have in UniswapV2's Analytics, for each day, the traded volume, and the total liquidity.

If you want to estimate the APY using only the information of the last day, the math is really simple:

`( 1 + ((volume*0.003)/liquidity) )^365`

If you want to do that estimation based in the last **N** days, then the math is the following:

`[ (1+((volume1*0.003)/liquidity1)) * ... * (1+((volumeN*0.003)/liquidityN)) ]^(365/N)`

In Deunifi, you have this information already calculated, and additionally you can change the amount of days used to estimate the LP's APY and the Vault's APY.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;sounds too good to be true, if the calculation was 49%

49 % is in the case you are collateralized 200%, but the LP's APY based in the last 30 days is around 26.6%.

If you use only the last 7 days to do the estimation, the LP's APY's is 17.7 % and a vault with a 200% collateralization has a 32.2 % APY.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;then market participants will end up adding more to the LP until returns arnt worth it

That's not totally true. 

First of all, there is a Ceil limit for each UNIV2\* vault type. So the amount of UNIV2\* generated with this mechanism is limited.

More liquidity means more stability in price, this means less price impact, causing more opportunities that increment the traded volume.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;how is there a double earning of ffees? I get the fees earned from uniswap. but once i mint on maker, i have some DAI which i can then loan out or buy more eth/usdc and readd to the LP (just an example) is that what you mean?

Yes, that is exactly I meant.

You have an example of the manual steps to achieve this, in the Deunifi documentation:

[https://docs.deunifi.org/core-concepts/deunifi-transaction#manual-steps-to-invest](https://docs.deunifi.org/core-concepts/deunifi-transaction#manual-steps-to-invest)

And there are different examples on how, the same operation, can be done in only one step using Deunifi:

[https://docs.deunifi.org/getting-started#lock-and-draw](https://docs.deunifi.org/getting-started#lock-and-draw)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;is there a testnet where you can experiment with creating dai to get a feel for the process without putting funds at risk?

Yes, you can test this only in the Kovan network. That is because MakerDao only exists in that test network. Here is the documentation on how to do that:

[https://docs.deunifi.org/test-network](https://docs.deunifi.org/test-network)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;si thejre a way to automatically have this managed with ur wallet withjout a bot?

Automatically, only with a bot.

Personally I do not like to put my money in the hands of a bot with rules written by others.

The rules are only rules and can fail.

I think the best approach is to not be collateralized too much (except for the UNIV2DAIUSCD-A vault type), and always pay some attention to the market.

For example, in the case of UNIV2USDCETH-A vault type, a collateralization ratio of 200% when ETH as a price `P`, means that you are going to be liquidated in case the price move to `0,41*P`.

So if you invest in an UNIV2USDCETH-A at 200% collateralization ratio when ETH has a price of 2200 USD/ETH, that means your liquidation ETH price, initially would be 902 USD/ETH.

I think that it is an acceptable ratio, because going from an ETH price of 2200 USD to a price of 902 USD, in this days where DeFi is more mature, it is very unlikely. But if it happens, you are going to have time to do some action to avoid liquidation.

Remember that you are going to gain fees with UNIV2USDCETH LPs tokens locked in your vault. Then, this initial liquidation price of 902 USD/ETH, it is going to decrease as the time passes, reducing the risk of liquidation too.",2021-07-04 01:02:20

nikola_j,"&gt;Still, isn't it better to borrow from Liquity since you don't pay interest? You only pay a one-off borrowing fee.

Abso-fucking-lutely, imho.

Some of the options I'd consider for low-rate loans:

* Liquity - no on-going fees, just a one-time fee at the point of borrowing; minimum c-ratio allowed is extremely low at 110%, but there's some fine print to be aware of in regards to that (namely the recovery mode and the LUSD redemption mechanism),
* Reflexer - they are currently piloting a -0.5% Stability fee, so esentially a self-repaying loan as mentioned [here](https://twitter.com/reflexerfinance/status/1409864734275522564); min c-ratio in Reflexer is 145%,
* MakerDAO ETH-C - currently at 1% Stability fee, was at 2% up until one week ago, I believe; their ETH-C variant has a very high minimum c-ratio of 175% though, so you'd need quite a high ratio of ETH to borrowed amount to make that a low liquidation price.

I recently posted an intro post about Liquity when we integrated it at DeFi Saver, you can find that [here](https://medium.com/defi-saver/liquity-is-live-in-defi-saver-should-you-consider-switching-fa3d4584b6d0) if interested (contains a bit of a comparison to MakerDAO).",2021-07-05 07:07:19

nikola_j,"*\*rolls up sleeves\**

CDPs are collateralized debt positions and it's a term that's historically in DeFi been mostly associated with MakerDAO, which introduced CDPs as a concept in this space, but since then there have been a number of new and different lending protocols that allow creating CDPs and Maker also tried switching to a different term with ""Vaults"".

In either case, today you can create CDPs in MakerDAO, Compound, Aave, Reflexer and Liquity, to name some of the more popular options. Each protocol has slightly or greatly different terms for borrowings, so that's worth looking into and comparing in order to make your pick.

I would personally suggest MakerDAO to first-timers in DeFi, as the positions (CDPs) are very simple with only one asset deposited and borrowed per one CDP, and there's the famous MakerDAO oracles with 1-hour delay, which is extremely helpful at times of price crashes, for example.

(However, MakerDAO also introduced minimum debt requirements which have now gone up to 10,000 Dai, so that may be a slight inconvenience for anyone looking to open relatively small positions.)

In terms of how to leverage more ETH using Maker or others, I would suggest reading this post I put together last year: [https://medium.com/defi-saver/how-to-long-or-short-any-asset-using-defi-lending-protocols-812300c9a640](https://medium.com/defi-saver/how-to-long-or-short-any-asset-using-defi-lending-protocols-812300c9a640)   
(I'm currently thinking of doing one to compare all the currently popular lending protocols, haven't see a nice summary on that posted just yet.)

As u/PhiMarHal also mentioned in the replies, you can just head directly to [https://app.defisaver.com/](https://app.defisaver.com/) and select Simulation mode - that will create a simulated environment (private, frozen mainnet fork) with 100 ETH in credits to play around with any of the integrated protocols.

I think you have a very rigid, too rigid, idea of what a stablecoin is. Their goal is just price stability. Most do it with a peg to USD, others peg to Gold and I'm sure there are other asset examples. But these coins achieve that in different ways, including algorithmically using lending like MakerDAO. They target the value of the dollar and if you understood how they did that, maybe actually look into the examples I'm talking about before calling me ignorant, then you would know that it's possible to target other values, including a slightly higher value to the dollar. And the price would be STABLE similar to Dai.

PhiMarHal,"I would say Instadapp is relatively safe, by sheer volume of users. With approvals you can always limit the approval amount to the number of tokens you want to transfer, rather than the default unlimited.

The risk with Instadapp is getting back out. They use a proprietary implementation of DSProxy with (some of?) the connectors ripped out, and as far as I know you can't migrate a Compound/Aave position back out. Workarounds exist but are fairly technical.

MakerDAO CDPs are easier. DefiSaver will allow you to migrate them off Instadapp (to DFS, but DFS uses the standard DSProxy, so you'll see your position in Oasis just as well).",2021-07-09 20:16:40

ethereumflow,"Someone had asked a question about wallets and then deleted the comment. I don’t want to delete my answer though. 

“What do you recommend for a wallet?” is the general question. 

Depends on the coin(s). Exodus is probably the best multi-coin wallet for a transition from exchange to cold storage. It’s a nice interface and easy to get setup but prone to some issues. Certainly suggest Exodus over Atomic wallet, which I have nothing but bad things to say after my experience. 

Coinomi is a good multi-coin wallet if you like paper wallets. It’s got an easy to use sweep feature and a simple interface. The beauty is in its simplicity. 

For Ethereum Metamask is the best choice for dapp exploration. But if you’re open to experimenting ONTO wallet works as an Ethereum wallet and has mobile support for most Ethereum dapps (Uniswap, SushiSwap, AAVE, MakerDAO and more) as well as Binance Chain and Polygon as well (mainnet not ERC20). You do not need ONT/ONG to use ONTO wallet. MyEtherWallet (MEW) is also worth considering. 

In general I always favour native wallets. For myself I have mostly Cosmos assets so I use Keplr and Cosmostation (both have Ledger support). For NEAR I use NEAR wallet but keep Moonlet for a mobile alternative. It’s not very convenient but I prefer having multiple seeds and various wallets instead of all of my eggs in one basket, no matter how secure that basket may be.",2021-07-11 04:07:46

I think that yes, there are a ton of redundant projects/platforms right now that we are going to thankfully see get weeded out as market selection does what it does.  DeFi will be the biggest growth sector, obvious, in crypto over the next decade -- we are still in very early stages.  I think most of the growth will be in non-ethereum blockchain projects (at least, relatively speaking, growth-wise) due to the fact that it'll help onboard a lot of new people and those who might want to try out different defi features/benefits without risking a $50+ transaction fee just for removing funds from an LP or something along those lines.

I see huge growth continuing to happen for projects like Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, etc.  The decentralized lending/flash loans that Aave offers are something that could never be available in a million years with traditional centralized finance...even in our market on defi taking a look at Aave's current lending pool utilization one can see that they are massively UNDER utilized, there's a huge upside potential for growth IMHO.",2021-07-11 19:51:33

I had to basically start over at that point so that’s just to put it in perspective that I’m really no whale.

nikola_j,"There are no fees for having it enabled (ie. for having your position just passively monitored).

Some additional info in no particular order:

* Automation cannot be used on positions sitting on standard Ethereum accounts (EOAs) - in order to use it importing to a smart wallet would be required  
(we at DeFi Saver use the standard dsproxy for all protocols and if you ever used MakerDAO, for example it means your account already has one and you're ready to go; the option to migrate from EOA to dsproxy is available in the app) (a bit more info [here](https://help.defisaver.com/general/what-is-the-smart-wallet))
* Because transaction fees have been rather costly on Ethereum for the greater part of 2021, we have introduced a $60,000 minimum debt requirement for enabling Automation, as smaller positions could be increasingly negatively impacted by transaction fees. (If your debt drops under that while your position is automated, it will still remain automated.)

* Automation has both auto-boosting and auto-repay available, make sure to disable auto-boosting under \[\]Advanced if you just want the liquidation protection part.

We are in touch with both entities and every time we receive feedback or are asked to do something, we do it in a timely manner.

Of course Golem Factory would be able to push this a bit forward and we have communicated this intention, but it is not enough - the community needs to voice there is a market for GLM as collateral.

r-2-eth-2,"**How To Stake DAI To Earn Interest: Beginner's Guide**

&gt; DAI keeps in line with the US dollar thanks to automatic smart contracts that liquidate positions, incentivising and repressing loan creation and by leveraging the MakerDAO governance token, MKR. What is DAI staking and how does it work? Once transferred, your DAI tokens will begin to earn interest at the current DAI savings rate. To earn interest from DeFi lending, a user will need to find a DAI liquidity pool on either a DEX, such as Uniswap, or a lending protocol, such as AAVE. The liquidity pool will have an associated APY. Once DAI tokens have been deposited into the liquidity pool a user will start earning rewards.

just4linux,"I have followed on Kava for soon a year for now. So I might have some more detailed information to share. 

First we can tackle on the interest rate currently it is actually a lot higher than 20% it's closer to 35%. Whatever they offer for you on exchange is bad. The exchange takes their portion of the profit and leaves less for you. You should always stake directly to validators yourself to get best profit. 

The reason why % is now high is because they want encourage to get more people to delegate their kava to validators in order to have healthy balance on their blockchain. afterall validators are the ones that run the whole blockchain and if large portion of it is divided already it's more secure. Also many of them are the ones to give votes for governance to which is required to reach minimum treshhold to accept changes. 

Once the ratio for Kava on validators gets to better ratio it is expacted to have % lowered to probably what it was before which is something around 10-15% and most of that is inflation. As per time being it is possible to do transactions for zero cost on the blockchain so it means that supply is expanding. But if it gets too high, they can remove the option to have free transactions and start to burn the supply to manage it, if needed. 

As per what Kava actually is, it's a defi ecosystem. And it's a very good one. They have planned to make all the basic products that you could ever want, MakerDAO like stablecoin, then Aave like borrowing and lending and uniswap like AMM (to be released in few months). But the big difference is that at least for now they have controlled which tokens are allowed on the chain. In comparison to eth and bsc, which are overloaded with tons of trashcoin, there's only certain more reputable coins like btc, bnb, etc. allowed onchain. Soon USDC and ETH are planned to be added as well. This will make the ecosystem much more cleaner in comparison to most of other blockchains. 

And while their products are very little known, based on my experience they have worked very well and offer very high return. Currently you can gain more than 100% apy for stablecoins for example. Is it sustainable? most likely will lower over time, but I'll enjoy it while it's still high. For some reason they just havent received much attention. Maybe because their guides for new users to join in and marketing has not been that great in my opinion. 

But overall, I'd say with them having different approach  to defi with cleaner ecosystem, I see it as sleeping giant, waiting to be found. My opinion is biased but I tried to explain the information without letting my opinion come too much out on this. My portfolio originally had 10% in kava ecosystem but in the last half a year the portion has grown into 30%. Never put any extra in, just yield farming and volatility.",2021-07-16 14:15:22

Dai is maintained and regulated by MakerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) composed of the owners of its governance token, MKR, who may vote on changes to certain parameters in its smart contracts in order to ensure the stability of Dai.

This is why its laughable to think you taught me anything about BOND because I completed the CB earn course weeks ago to get my free BOND tokens😂. The CB earn program puts BOND in front of millions of eyes that were not there previously. That is bound to spark SOME interest even if only a small amount. BOND only needs a small about of retail interest for a large part of the supply to be gone. MKR is more than ""lending coin"" It allows for voting power over the makerdao protocol. Same goes for YFI in the Yearn.Finance platform.. You are struggling to comprehend the role of governance tokens in defi platforms.

I think he's basically saying ""stablecoins are troublesome because we don't have a regulatory framework to ensure that they're backed by the reserves they claim to be backed by"", and if that's really the problem he has with them then MakerDAO is probably sitting quite pretty. The mix of assets backing DAI is sitting right out there in the open.

downwithnarcy,"AFAIK, many DeFi borrowers tend to use stablecoins as collateral to borrow other stablecoins (due to the low chance of liquidations).

They also use StableCoins pairs in the liquidity pools themselves.

The MakerDAO collapse happened because the availability of DAI dried up in the system after the ETH price collapse….leading to a huge debt burden in the liquidity pools. They then had to print Maker tokens, to auction for more DAI to make up for the deficit.  

But theoretically, if you can keep enough supply of stablecoin, it could prop up the liquidity pools from completely collapsing.

This is just speculation. It could also be that we did see a huge DeFi triggered correction in May, it was just halted by other market forces. You can see a big influx of ETH value on Aave( [DeFi pulse](https://defipulse.com/) ) right before the big drop.",2021-07-21 13:06:48
InevitableSoundOf,"If most are using stablecoins as collateral then the risk of mass liquidations wouldn't happen if ETH tanked. De-pegging would potentially though if the borrowed asset didn't drop aswell. I think it'd just be a judgement call to decide on that one.

A substantial drop in the price of the crypto in a crypto/stablecoin pair would see large imperment loses. This would trigger a pullout of the liquidity pools as I don't see people pumping in more money to prop them up, as there is no gain. However previous price drops haven't seen a widespread pullout.

FaceDeer,"Maker would also collapse if ETH's value was to crater, too. Though less so than it would have back when ETH was the only collateral. The whole point of adding stablecoins like USDC was to mitigate the near-catastrophe Maker had back in March last year when a drop in ETH caused mass liquidations that couldn't be countered with ETH alone.

&gt; DAI should have a strict rule not to allow centralized assets as a collateral as it defeats the purpose it was created for in the first place.

Couple of problems with that. First, the purpose for which MakerDAO was created is to *maintain the peg of DAI to US dollars.* There's nothing in that that prohibits or requires any particular collateral types, MakerDAO's mandate is to go with whatever works to that end. Secondly, as this article says, MakerDAO is going to be fully decentralized now so the only ""strict rules"" left are the ones in the actual smart contract. It's up to MKR holders to decide what types of collateral to accept now. Decentralization means it's out of any particular group's control.

&gt; Better yet, it should've always stayed with only ETH as a single collateral, what's wrong with that.

We saw what was wrong with that back in March 2020, ETH's price suddenly dropped and there were mass liquidations. DAI nearly lost its peg. The whole point of multi-collateral is to diversify DAI's backing so that it's not as strongly affected by fluctuations in the price of any particular one.

At the end of the day, results are what matters. If DAI's peg fails then MKR holders will lose their money, so that's why it's up to them to make these decisions to prevent that from happening.",2021-07-22 00:11:21
admachbar,"Ok, ""you went full retard; you never go full retard"".  So let's bring you back from the brink. 

Even in the most decentralized of models where entities such as MakerDAO, Oasis and Uniswap may  operate, the 'natural and legal person(s)' acting (making trades , loans, tokenizing, etc.) on these 'platforms' are generally responsible for respecting regulation imposed on all participants of the said activity (That goes for taxation, market specific regulation, representation, etc.). In APE speak... you can't legally do stuff on blockchains which is illegal to do otherwise (that should not come as a surprise to most people with half a brain).

Decentralization, specifically second generation blockchains, provide multiple advantages over traditional centralized models and they offer the promise of shaking up the traditional world of intermediated trade. 

In fact... most of the bullshit we are fighting against right now is because of intermediation (Shitadel &amp; Co.). 

You could probably argue that the current DRS/Cede stock ownership model is deprecated and that it could be ""re-decentralized"" (remember, your grandpa used to keep his stock certificates in a safe).

The challenge today is the following: authorities don't trust citizens and believe that constant monitoring is required to ensure 'proper' market operation. Monitoring is super simple in a central/custodial model where one entity has access to all the data. 

For the same reasons as most of you .... I think that's bullshit. Citizens must recapture ownership and enforce trust. For that, though, citizens have to understand their responsibilities.",2021-07-22 02:07:50

Other stablecoins try to use algorithms to keep their peg...like UST or RAI or LUSD (although RAI isn't pegged to the dollar... It's just meant to be stable in value).",2021-07-22 03:57:12
bdubyageo,"You mentioned MakerDAO, Oasis, and Uniswap.  I spend a fair amount of time researching crypto and haven't heard of Oasis outside of a couple recent mentions here on Superstonk.  For example, if you look for Oasis on coinmarketcap, [you can see it doesn't stand out](https://i.imgur.com/Qcdsgze.png).  I'm guessing the native token is ROSE?  It's not obvious, and Oasis isn't popular and well known like MarkerDAO and Uniswap.  Why Oasis instead of something like Synthetix?

To list Oasis in the middle of MakerDAO and Uniswap, two very well known entities in the DeFi space, is kind of sus tbh.  I'm not trying to be a dick, but could you please elaborate a little bit on Oasis?",2021-07-22 05:01:12

You also get the choice to either simply claim the INST tokens or use them to add more collateral or pay back part of your debt or just swap them to whatever right away, like so: [https://imgur.com/zm2kSe9](https://imgur.com/zm2kSe9)[https://imgur.com/zm2kSe9](https://imgur.com/zm2kSe9)

For example you can utilize flash loans to repay your debt with part of your collateral, normally you’d need to introduce new Dai into the loan under the normal MakerDao Oasis interface. Or you’d have to manually withdraw some, sell on Uniswap, and repay (3-4 steps vs 1 step). 

For the auto saver part you asked about, it’s just constantly adjusting between loan borrowing and repaying depending on price movement. When price rises you borrow more from the collateral and stack it back into itself, and when it’s crashing you constantly sell to pay back collateral and safely exit the position.",2021-07-25 19:59:47

Sanguinius-kek,"Fraud investigator is not a uselss job. Having to go throguh several different countries as middlemen exchanges during a international bank transfer is however and takes ages. Additionally theres a minimum transaction limit which crypto heavily reduces. This video talks about it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO9QAEuXzo4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO9QAEuXzo4)

'muh blockchain takes ages' Spoken like someone who thinks ETH and other archaic tech is all crypto. Many take the same small amount of time . The example in that video being stellar lumens which has pretty much instant. Additionally youre only concerned with small transactions by individuals. Larger transactions such as those by corporations etc. across various economic zones takes longer (hence why the jobs exist which makes this irrefutable). 

Again you mention 'the blockchain' without stating which ones and ignore how the tech is developing quickly. It uses less energy than a bunch of people havign to go into work at financial institutes to do the same job and who can do mistakes. minimal support staff required (as shown again in that ONE example). You keep mentioning miners. Aka you think PoW is the only consensus method in existence. mining is mainly done for either BTC or ETH. BTC is essentially the equivalent of what gold is to fiat in terms of its price and its not very usable. But liek gold its a market indicator and store of value. Once its all mined (as it has a supply limit) then the energy costs are highly reduced. ETH is mined heavily because its a heavily trafficed network and thus mining for it is profitable. ETH however is a slow piece of shit as anyone who has done transfers over Uniswap will tell you. However it still serves its purpose and allows for transactions to occur in areas it wouldnt have. Furthermore if vitalik gets of his arse then the change to the PoS consensus method will be implemented sooner. The part that solves the major mining problem you bitch about. Oh whats that you think PoW is the only consensus method? Well shit that means you dont know what youre on about then.

people in those countries dont have access to buying such currencies due to laws or its very difficult to do so. Oh wait. They can just buy stablecoins such as USDT, BUSD, USDC etc. or buy the fiat on the crypto exchange themselves. Once again you dont know such things exist as you have done no research and think that crypto = just ETH and BTC or other volatile assets. Your argument on deflation is attributed to the realisation of value. By the point that occurs with fiat its already been fucked for several years before that point. Additionally you are assuming that all crypto is deflationary and has its value based in the same way a fiat currency is. Its not. inflation promotes spending. So why is gold not always inflating/devaluing then given thats pretty much the 'basis' or rather was for fiat? Because inflation and deflation alone do not serve as sole indicators of economic health for a country/economy. Furthermore you can spend your crypto. 'but muh cant buy shit new iphone' they dotn accept it yet? Cool you just buy fiat with crypto then and use that. Literall the same way you would with alternate currencies in different countries who do not accept your version of fiat. You can also store shitloads of fiat which happens on a huge scale with a small part of it beign in active circulation in an economy. Once again this occurs in stuff like the UK, the US, and the EU etc.

Your argument on USDT can be attributed to fiat. Except you can get away with it in fiat due to immense corruption in the world. Other examples exist which have their value based on the US dollar. these include BUSD, USDC and DAI which is part of the MakerDAO network: [https://makerdao.com/en/](https://makerdao.com/en/)

Crypto is not fiat you dumb cunt. It has its value MEASURED against fiat because thats the most recognisable wealth metric. You dont see stores putting the value of a loaf of bread according to gold do you? Youre implying that fuckign fiat isnt valued on percieved value, hype and a similar form of debt (as is all currency). Your GBP and USD all have value because you deem it has value. It represents value as value owed by labour etc. This occurs for all currency. What youre actually annoyed by is volatility. Volatility is high during early use of a currency or during huge events in a country. A governing body (in the case of fiat a reserve ran by the government) imposes restrictions to prevent huge volatility fucking everyday life up for its citizens/users. This occurs with stablecoins as well as shown in the MakerDAO example. Except in the case for some crypto currencies this governance isnt centralised. 

If the value of your fiat drops you also have nothing. It has no intrinstic value. Oh wait you still use it though? What because evreryone else uses it? No different to crypto then especially given most fiat is digitised and not physical. The difference here is that crypto is more efficient from a computational viewpoint and will eventually be implemented into widespread use. For example the UK treasury is interested in having their own 'stablecoin'. It would be the same as digitised GBP but transactions are far smoother/efficient. Crypto is similar to but not the same as digitised fiat. Plus if you actually thought they were the same then that completely goes against your own criticism. 

Ah yes so you some code monkey making shit products for what are essentially literal whos or low interest in the idea companies completely negates tghe technology's financial use. With your same shit anecdote I can find many people who do similar work who will say the opposite. Hence theres many different cryptocurrencies and many different networks. Many of them not shit. Just because you made a shit API or worked on a shitcoin that failed or was part of a rugpull (which can also happen with any asset) doesnt discredit the idea.

The bit on fraud proves you dotn use crypto and a blithering idiot. How do you buy crypto? You sign up to an exchange which requires identification to be used. You trade on a network freely. You can still get robbed with fiat and could easily before support networks are set up. Cryptio is new and doesnt have this implemented (and it still occurs wirth fiat and it used to be even more widespread in fiat). At best you have 1 exchange account that send to hardware wallets. Cool How do you cash out without usign the same account. The one with a public ledger that can be used to help stop fraud and laundering. I.e a more useable one than the mess that is data systems by banks etc. Plus money laundering and fraud happen shitloads with fiat especially if youre rich enough to just ignore it/have the data altered as its not immutable. 

Youve posted classic FUD, classic cope posts, and classic 'muh what about dis' tier arguments and even threw in a fucking shit anecdote that can easily have an opposite one posted. You clearly know fuck all about crypto given the drivel youve typed up (which makes me question how you were able to work with it/was your work just dogshit) and are simply another person seething about high GPU prices and need to place the blame on one group.

The US Dollar is definetly not backed 1:1 yet people still believe it has value.

The point is moot anyway. Maker DAO is aware of this problem and there is already plans in the making for diversifiying away from USDC to reduce counterparty risk.   I also hate the fact that USDC is so dominant but the truth is that MakerDAO has 3 Billion USDC that can be easily diversified. For example getting cash is an option getting US Bonds might actually be a requirement for stable coins to move forward.

The thing is whatever happens MakerDAO can react fast and mitigate any risk. USDC would be fucked if they freeze 12% of their USDC this would instantly destroy the trust people have in USDC so they would have to be forced by the government and this wont just go without notice because pretty sure that circle would sue them.. Also circle would be fucked if Maker decides to cash out 3.2 Billion USDC in Dollar which they could do anytime. MakerDao is in a great position. And if the governments crack down hard on stable coins DAI is going to be one of the few that can survive anything the government throws at them.

&gt; There's a lesson here for the folks who built automated money maker Uniswap as well as for other protocol developers in the decentralized finance industry. For some time, DeFi advocates speculated that regulators who've found ways to impose anti-money laundering, know-your-customer and securities rules on centralized, custodial crypto exchanges and wallets such as Coinbase would run into a dilemma with decentralized exchanges because, supposedly, there is no one in charge for them to go after. In a blog post last week, founder Rune Christensen said the MakerDAO Foundation, which runs the lending system, will hand over control entirely to a decentralized autonomous organization, also called MakerDAO.As Christensen explained on our podcast recently, the founders quickly learned it was impossible to launch an entirely decentralized platform from the start.

But what it also allows is for Celsius to deploy a portion of their treasury into further yield generating efforts. I don't think the proposal has been implemented yet, but we could see a rise in rewards rates on the CEL token when we get there.

- The devs were always supposed to give up control at some point and for MakerDAO to become completely autonomous and decentralized. They declared this was accomplished months ago and returned their funding to community governance, the future of MakerDAO is now truly in the hands of the DAO itself. So them leaving leadership roles is not inherently a bad thing, it was the goal.

- DAI is the standout success story for a decentralized, automated stablecoin peg. Every other major stablecoin is backed by a company and a centralized form of asset reserves. I could just be ignorant here, but does DAI even have any capable/rising competitors to its fully decentralized stablecoin role?

- If you think DAI has a unique future, MKR must also. If you think DAI could easily be surpassed by a new decentralized stablecoin, and deprecates DAI - which is possible - then MKR will fade as well. The future usage of DAI in DeFi is, for me, the number one consideration.",2021-08-04 05:01:00

とても興味深い質問だと思います。DAOは最近注目のトピックですよね！

私はイーサリアム財団の将来について特別な見解を持っているわけではありませんが、イーサリアム財団の役割はMaker Foundationとは少し違うように思います。Maker Foundationは、基本的には現在話題の「コミュニティへのエグジット」を実現するためにMakerDAOのプロトコルとガバナンスを立ち上げました。コミュニティは、オンチェーン構造を利用することで、MKRを保有する際のリスクパラメータや投票など、将来の取り組みを調整することが可能です。

ArcadesOfAntiquity,"Been there. Let me tell you my story and offer a little advice. Advice first.

(TLDR the way to succeed with crypto is by setting everything up to allow yourself to ignore it)
 
**1) invest with a long time horizon**

Stay in a ""long-term"" frame of mind when it comes to investing.

5 years is typically considered long term in traditional markets. So treat crypto as a 5 year minimum hold. In crypto 5 years can feel like 20. This can be a surprisingly exhausting experience. You need to be psychologically well-armed in order to...

**2) prepare funds for the next long term downtrend**

Make sure you are positioned for the next long term buying opportunity, NOT, and this is key, so I repeat **NOT including money you would gain from selling your current crypto holdings!**

In other words the only way to be sane about crypto investing is to be able to ignore it so you can focus on building investable wealth in other areas of your life. Sadly for a lot of people this would mean staying away from crypto entirely. I'm not trying to say I'm immune to this. Quite the opposite in fact. Holding crypto and being addicted to checking prices has probably damaged my mental health.

There's no way a person can really apply their best effort to building wealth in non-crypto areas if they can't learn to forget about the current market value of their crypto portfolio. Another key to keeping it off your mind is to...

**3) plan your exit**

Whether you choose to enter the market via a DCA strategy, a one time buy, or some combination, make sure you choose your exit price. For ETH, anything under $10k is a reasonable (i.e. conservative) 5 year target in my opinion. Many in this sub forecast $20k or higher as you probably know. But with a five year time frame, you are entirely reasonable to set a $10k sell target.

(edit: if you are a real ETH believer, set aside a percentage of your ETH as ""never selling"". You can use this to e.g. stake or take out a loan to live off of or invest with. Search for the Double Logris for one fancy example of this strategy.)

**Story to put this advice in context:**

Like you I was also pretty down on myself for ""missing the boat"". I got in around May of 2017. If I'd been thinking more clearly I would have seen the scope of the opportunity. I would have just gone into monk mode, sold a bunch of stuff I owned, moved into a studio apartment, worked 50-60 hours a week, stopped eating out and drinking, and put every bit of disposable income I had into ETH.

I didn't do any of those things, and instead obsessively checked prices even while at work. I attempted to trade my way to more ETH, sometimes succeeding, more often failing. In winter 2017, despite realizing that I missed a big opportunity, I was still quite euphoric when ETH price was $1400. Then I watched it go down, down, down, until at $650 or so I figured this was a likely place for things to turn around. I used MakerDAO to take out a loan (collateralized debt position, aka CDP) using my ETH as collateral. With the loan I bought more ETH.

Over the months that followed ETH went to $80. I had to periodically sell my ETH at a loss on the way down in order to prevent my CDP from being liquidated.

I lost double digits of ETH this way.

The whole time I could have been DCA-ing more, but I didn't. By the time the depths of the bear had hit, I was depressed, feeling like an idiot. I still had that memory of feeling like a genius at the top of the bull run though. I held on to that memory and the hope of having it again a few years later. In 2020 I bought as much ETH as I could risk doing.

Today I'm feeling better but... numb. It's a hell of a drug, I guess you could say. In some ways it's been very negative for me, because I performed poorly at work and put my own plans for starting a business on hold so I could check prices. That improved a bit over the bear market but with the bull back it's a struggle for me to keep things orderly.

Anyway this comment got pretty long but I hope it is useful to you or someone else reading.",2021-08-05 11:33:42

TheCryptosAndBloods,"I don't know your country, but in most places - as long as you are reporting and paying your taxes - it's your money. You can trade and move it around as much as you want, so I wouldn't worry about breaking the *law*. 

I'd worry more that your bank has crypto-unfriendly policies and they'll randomly close your account or block funds because some internal algorithm flagged unusual activity and then it's a nightmare sorting things out - especially if it is your main bank account. You could try calling them I suppose, but whatever call centre person answers your call, you probably can't rely on their answer - they won't have the authority (or know about) to tell you how the compliance policies of the bank will be implemented - so they may say ""go ahead"" and the funds will still get blocked. Or the opposite - they may say ""not allowed"", but if you ignore them, it might work anyway. 

If you are rich enough to have a personal relationship manager - or some bank employee who you can contact directly by name (not a call centre), then you may be able to get useful information out of them. 

There was a good tweet thread a year or so ago about a MakerDAO employee in Germany who basically had all her bank accounts shut down by mistake (I think the German tax office thought she owed them money, and shut down her bank account and took the money or something, but it was a mistake because she had actually paid her tax) and for weeks she had no bank account to use for living expenses and basically had to live off DAI.

Number of transactions gives no information about the value of the transaction. You could be sending a test transaction on some ghost chain, or you could be opening a million dollar leveraged position on MakerDAO using Ethereum.

Both of those are 1 transaction.

Another way to think about it: comparing blockchains by the total number of transactions is like comparing stores by the total number of items sold.

nikola_j,"&gt;The minimum issue can be solved by using the lending protocol directly rather than DeFi Saver

Just wanted to highlight that Automation minimum requirements at DeFi Saver are exactly that - they only apply for Automation specifically, which is an add-on service on top of lending protocols.

You can use any lending protocol through DeFi Saver and never use DFS Automation and still have access to advanced leverage options (e.g. boost, repay) while not dealing with any minimums.

On the other hand, there are also some noticeably high minimums in the MakerDAO protocol nowadays, too. Namely, you can no longer create a new CDP if you're borrowing/generating less than 10,000 Dai. And for ETH-B specifically that minimum is 30,000 Dai. But these minimums are at the MakerDAO protocol level and nothing specific to DFS.

Uniswap - brainchild of Hayden Adams and Vitalik, is in constant talks with Robinhood, Stripe, and others to implement this technology in their tech stack

Chainlink - deployed on Ethereum

Compound kickstarted yield farming with COMP rewards - deployed on Ethereum

MakerDAO - been in the works forever, has some of the biggest brains behind them and is currently onboarding real world assets as collateral

AAVE is testing a pool for institutional investors to use DeFi

In addition to all of this, Ethereum has now also captured culture through NFTs - artists are flocking to this space because they can sell their art directly and without any middlemen, build a social media following in the crypto scene, and flourish because crypto made a lot of people rich. The metaverse is also slowly happening but still in its infancy

Network effects too strong, supply crisis incoming due to the merge and EIP-1559, Layer 2 about to go crazy with apps we haven't even thought of because we now have instant finality and low fees.

There's so much to be excited about and when you realize that all of this stuff only got traction because some  gigabrain devs on Ethereum built it all, you quickly realize that other chains simply can't compete with this amount of mindshare and absurdly bullish tokenomics.

cryptOwOcurrency,"&gt; Assuming that’s right, can’t maker owners just never increase the USDC cap and only allow ETH / other assets to raise their limits? Thus chipping away at USDC dominance? 

It's a deeper systems design thing. Imagine that DAI is going above peg, say it's at $1.02.

Normally, governance reduces the interest rate (stability fee) so that more people will be incentivized to lock up ETH and take out loans, flooding the market with more DAI and bringing the price down to peg.

But the problem is that even with completely free borrowing, a zero percent interest rate, there still weren't enough people willing to lock up ETH (or other trustless coins) and take out the free loans. Thus no way to print more properly collateralized DAI to keep the peg down.

So more recently, MakerDAO invented the ""peg stability module"" which lets people directly trade USDC into the Maker contract for DAI, to arb the peg down so the peg doesn't get out of control, but obviously the downside to that is that whenever DAI price spikes, Maker keeps taking more and more USDC on its balance sheet from the arbers.

The problem is that there's no way for the money supply (DAI) to contract, only to expand. As more and more DAI gets lost and forgotten, there's no way to confirm it's out of circulation and take it off Maker's debt sheet, so the DAI tokens remain ""live"" and need to be collateralized, even if they're in an address with a completely forgotten private key. With Reflexer, they can slowly devalue RAI, emulating a negative interest rate and sucking debt out of the system (and out of dead RAI holders' wallets) over a longer time frame, where this value is accumulated to Vault holders in the form of depreciation of the borrowed asset (so, you get paid to borrow). But with a hard target of $1, Maker isn't able to do that with DAI.",2021-08-12 00:53:03

Second, it's worth quoting from a [technical blog post](https://medium.com/dfinity/understanding-the-internet-computers-network-nervous-system-neurons-and-icp-utility-tokens-730dab65cae8) on the NNS:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; For example, it \[NNS\] can upgrade the protocol and software used by the node machines that host the network; it can create new subnet blockchains to increase network capacity; it can split subnets to divide their load; it can configure economic parameters that control how much must be paid by users for compute capacity; and, in extreme situations, it can freeze malicious Canister smart contract software in order to protect the network; and many other things 

What this means is that the community of ICP stakers can vote through the NNS to update the protocol and also update canisters. This description of the NNS may at first glance seem quite powerful (I frankly did not get it its intent in the beginning), so it's worth describing ***the intent*** of community-driven NNS:

The Intent is to be able to upgrade the protocol with the times by the wishes of the community. Some of the lessons of the crypto industry are baked into the kind of t[opics that the NNS accepts proposals for](https://medium.com/dfinity/understanding-the-internet-computers-network-nervous-system-neurons-and-icp-utility-tokens-730dab65cae8). These updates include crypto

I want to zoom in to one of those lessons/examples, and the basis of this conversation: T[he DAO Hack in 2016.](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao#section-the-dao-hack-remedy-forks-ethereum) For those not familiar, the DAO hack was an event early in Ethereum's existence where a hacker exploited a smart contract to ~~steal~~ drain funds from a DAO. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In the meantime, the Ethereum community debated how to respond to the attack. The DAO’s failure would not only mean financial loss for investors, but it also bore dire repercussions for the nascent Ethereum network

The end result is what was more unique: The ETH community did a hard fork and rolled back the state to a time before the hack:

&gt;The hard fork effectively rolled back the Ethereum network’s history to before The DAO attack and reallocated The DAO’s ether to a different smart contract so that investors could withdraw their funds. This was extremely controversial — after all, blockchains are supposed to be immutable and censorship-resistant.

But it begs the question... HOW did they roll back the state without an NNS, well the answer  is messy: 

&gt;Though it was proposed by Ethereum developers, they did not have the unilateral power to implement the change. Miners, exchanges, and node operators also had to agree to update their software. After more heated debate in public forums, on July 20, 2016, at block 192,000, the Ethereum hard fork was implemented.

And now we get back to the NNS.

Notice which people were necessary to make a change to the network: Miners, exchanges, node operators. Notice who is missing: *Token Holders*. I am not criticizing ETH, but want to make a point that all networks agree on the state by some group. In the case of ETH, it is (mostly), the miners. **One of the design goals of the Internet Computer is that the nodes work on consensus and compute, but it is the token holders who get to make upgrade decisions**.

So to answer your question: Yes, if the community submits and approves a proposal for the NNS to remove a canister (for whatever reason), then the NNS will do as the community wants. The ""harsh truth"" of crypto is that no smart contract (in any crypto network) is *truly* immutable: they can be changed by enough node colluding (e.g. ETH) or by enough community members in the NNS. That is the whole point of ""consensus."" Entities can agree to change history if they want (they do not for game-theoretical reasons to not destroy their own network's value). For the NNS, the *intent* is that such a canister-removing proposal be used in ***extreme*** circumstances (indeed, the DAO hack was very unique in ETH's history, and nothing that dangerous has happened to ETH). 

You could make an argument that Canister removals should have a higher threshold of acceptance by the community than 51%, maybe 2/3 or 4/5. I would agree with that to be honest.

I hope that makes sense.",2021-08-12 12:35:18

cryptOwOcurrency,"Clicking a dropdown is easier than installing a new wallet.

I don't believe you're grasping that Arbitrum is a first-class alternative smart contract network just as much as Solana is. From solely a UX perspective, whether a network is Layer 1 or Layer 2 is next to meaningless. Every time you say that users have to move their assets over to a separate network, well, if they chose Solana instead of Arbitrum, they would still have to bridge their assets from wherever they currently are (maybe the Ethereum Layer 1, or BSC).

Take for example a user who owns ETH and wants to bridge their ETH to Arbitrum or Solana. I believe Solana is planning to gain a lot of their user base from Ethereum L1 users who get fed up with the fees and want to switch, so this seems like a reasonable example.

If the user's ETH is in their own wallet, then:

* To move it to Arbitrum, they use an Arbitrum bridge, then switch the metamask extension they already have installed to Arbitrum via the dropdown.

* To move it to Solana, they have to install a new extension, generate a new wallet, and use the Solana bridge (wormhole).

If the user's ETH is on an exchange, then:

* If the exchange supports tokenized ETH on the Arbitrum network, they can withdraw the ETH directly to Arbitrum. Otherwise they withdraw to the Ethereum L1 and bridge to Arbitrum.

* If the exchange supports tokenized ETH on the Solana network, they can withdraw the ETH directly to Solana. Otherwise they withdraw to the Ethereum L1 and bridge to Solana.

In all cases, moving ETH to Arbitrum takes the same amount of effort and cost, or less, as moving it to Solana.

If the user switches to Arbitrum, they can continue to use Metamask, the same tool they have always used and are familiar with. Then while on Arbitrum, they can use Uniswap, SushiSwap, Aave, Curve, Etherscan, Loopring, and MakerDAO as they're used to using on the Ethereum L1, but with low fees. These are the Arbitrum launch partners when the mainnet goes public in the next two weeks.

Just as moving assets to Binance Smart Chain has been the obvious lowest friction play for Ethereum users who want lower fees but don't care about decentralized custody, Arbitrum will be the obvious lowest friction play for users who want lower fees but do care about decentralized custody.",2021-08-12 22:23:29
kalbhairavaa,"No. IMHO.

Sorry to say but STEVE from rocket cryptos video about DAO is his misunderstanding of what makerDAO is and what DAI is.

The value of a tradable coin is determined by its supply and demand. Hence buys result in price appreciation and sells in depreciation.

This happens outside of the coins code and in exchanges.

The coins code mostly has no impact on the coins price.

Whereas in the case of a A stable coins it’s value or its peg is controlled by code which can changed behind the scene.

A regular coin like SHiBs code cannot be changed as ethereum smart contracts are immutable.

A stable coins code would have a proxy/upgradable mechanism, which means the contract code deployed at an address which we use to add it to a wallet is not the code that actually controls the coin it is some other contract or contracts that do it.

A stable coin also does not have a max supply.  It can be minted or burned based on how it’s peg is achieved.

In case of USDC it is the Fiat and other bonds , in case of DAI it is their code based on the collateral(read crypto) supplied while someone borrows money from maker. Maker pays you money as DAI and when you pay back the DAI obtained as interest is burned 

To do this with SHIB we will need to be able to mint and burn SHIB.

But all of SHIB has already been minted. It was supplied as a whole (495T) to uniswap.

So there goes the chance of minting it.

Now we are left with burn. To burn we would still need the SHIB coin which are with ppl and exchanged at the moment and not with the devs .

Also as per the site the uniswap liquidity is locked and there are no keys so it can’t be withdrawn either.


Regarding SHI, it is most likely a new coin as with blockchains that allow mining the coin used is basically minted to pay the miners.

So… yeah",2021-08-12 23:51:37

Short answer is yes. Long answer:

Ergo is a EUTxO model based PoW network with smart contracts. They are associated with EMURGO and IOG who also work on Cardano but the two projects are independent. There's a lot of shared brainpower and research efforts between the projects as well. Basically the projects are close to each other and like to trade ideas around. This has led to a general approach that focuses on them building complementary features to each other.

In the grand scheme of things Ergo is posturing itself as a major DEX and Oracle pool provider for the EUTxO ecosystem (of which Cardano is the largest network atm). These together lend well to crypto backed Stablecoin operation so there's been quite a bit of work building out an incredibly robust stablecoin system called the AgeUSD protocol (can be extended to any other fiat currency as well).

There are also projects currently building cross chain links from these projects on Ergo over to Plutus so they can run on Cardano as well and bridge between both networks. 

This positions Ergo to fill the role within the EUTxO model ecosystem that Chainlink, Uniswap, and DAI/MakerDAO currently fill in the Account model ecosystem.",2021-08-13 01:25:38

This would explain why Tether FUD is perpetuated so much. Tether is outside FED control, so naturally it would be nice for them to try and shut down Tether. Our FED would want ""FED coin"" to be the only one with money printing power.

Anyways, all this gets thrown out the window when you learn about decentralized stablecoins that are backed by over-collateralized ETH. Namely, DAI (issued by MakerDAO) and LUSD (issued by Liquity).",2021-08-13 17:37:04

dmihal,"Still an apples-to-oranges transaction.

Transferring BTC from 1 account to another is different than opening a CDP on MakerDAO, depositing collateral and borrowing Dai. But both are just 1 transaction.

Also, with rollups, 1 mainnet Ethereum transaction can contain thousands of L2 transactions",2021-08-13 19:46:34
nikola_j,"Hey, u/ilpirata79 and anyone else reading.

The Instadapp team introduced the INST governance token in June together with an airdrop for all Maker Vault owners at the point of their snapshot, but for anyone to be able to claim it - one had to migrate the Vault to their platform and their proxy, which is a migration that makes you lose compatibility with apps that stick to standard MakerDAO architecture based around the dsproxy, such as Oasis and DeFi Saver.

Initially, you could have manually done the process of migrating the Vault there to claim the airdrop and then migrating it, but in the meantime we also introduced a more convenient way for anyone who wants to claim the drop.

The new option you saw is a custom recipe containing multiple actions, including: migrating vault to instadapp, claiming  INST, migrating  vault back to dsproxy and (optionally) swapping INST and potentially adding it to your CDP as bonus collateral or using it to pay back some debt.

This kind person shared few bits on how the process looks for the user: [https://twitter.com/ncerovac/status/1422212747681488900](https://twitter.com/ncerovac/status/1422212747681488900)

Here are some random example transactions that complete this process:

* [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x71b1d7a12a46ef875de217243e9342a9f67e11ad3e52a43bbb91cc78b52954ed/advanced](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x71b1d7a12a46ef875de217243e9342a9f67e11ad3e52a43bbb91cc78b52954ed/advanced)

* [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5bb750540ab466b29d293f1ae94511a2e8a4d37a026c95680be6852f90eb2b0e/advanced](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5bb750540ab466b29d293f1ae94511a2e8a4d37a026c95680be6852f90eb2b0e/advanced)

By the way, a small curiosity - the Instadapp team made a snapshot of all Maker Vaults and then had maximum INST claim amounts set for accounts based on that snapshot. In case anyone's Vault balance went down after the snapshot, that also means there will be a decreased amount of INST available to claim. In order to maximize your claim, this custom recipe will also include a flash loan that tops up your Vault for the duration of the transaction, but only if needed. ([Here's](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3ff360362512fae1f6fbfe2073460c020182832b0440685214b02ffa7d3a930e) one example of such a transaction, too.)

There's been over 100 users who already claimed INST using DeFi Saver, so it's definitely legitimate and safe. If you do happen to get stuck (e.g. get a failing transaction warning) - by all means reach out so we figure it out.

FruitBeef,"FYI I barely know what I'm talking about but I'll giive it a shot: EIP 1559 was intended to make gas prices a bit more predictable. Take a look at this [graph](https://makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/b/b47a329672ecfee63fb872f4c50567daa8894c41_2_690x376.png) , it basically shows that as the amount of demand increases, the fees increase exponentially.

Before EIP-1559 it was possible for the gas prices to shoot up instantly if there was a lot of demand in a small space of time. With this model, as blocks are consistently full, the price to include a transaction in the block increases exponentially, thus people will wait for the gas to come back down unless their transactions are really worth it to them. When blocks are below target for how full they are, then prices go back down pretty quickly aswell (for simplicity let's will assume the gas limit, aka the amount of transactions in a block, doesn't change). We can see post update that the average tends to hover around 30-50 gwei, but also keep in mind we were much lower when the price of ETH was bottoming in July. Without EIP-1559 theres a higher risk of having transactions get stuck because the fees change too quickly. Meaning you could send the transaction with the fee at one level, but in that next block fees could be 2x as high and your transaction will likely fail if it doesn't come back down in time.

Unfortunately you have to pay the gas premiums to use Ethereum, or have a significant amount of ETH such that the profit you're making is worth the gas. But you're in luck, because the ecosystem is about to explode with 2nd layer solutions. Arbitrum is set to make big moves this month, and theres currently sidechains like Polygon that have a decent amount of dapps. Currently its a bit of a waiting game for Layer 2 solutions, as developers will needd to port over apps (as simple as the click of a button in some cases), but more importantly liquidity will be in high demand when assets start to migrate to the Layer 2's.",2021-08-14 02:37:07

uh0h-itsfine,"I think dot &amp; ksm could be nice hedges but I'm w/ eth &amp; interoperability projects for the long run.

from what i hear BSC has no longevity soo not overly concerned w/ what their short term run does if they burn out or cant scale. not sure

polygon is the only scaling solution I've used so far and it's been nothing short of great in comparison to being completely priced out of defi on eth mainnet. i wait 20mins to bridge to polygon and mostly 1.5hr tops to bridge most assets back to layer 1. not perfect but I leave most my assets there in pools to mature anyway.

layer 2s are still early days, clunky is expected before it's smoothed out and that's why native users are rewarded for their early adoption &amp; studying. other protocols are already building to expedite the several day delays when bridging between chains/L2s to eth mainnet. (makerdao bridge, hop, deversifi)

far from mass adoption, hell regulation isnt even in place, but that doesn't mean innovation and onboarding wont still happen + got VCs and angel investors funding crypto start-ups + tradfi adoption (for better or worse). 

learning curve w/ all tech is usually a pain - see dial up internet, scratched floppy discs &amp; damaged external HDs, even driving a manual vehicle, etc. those who want to learn will learn, others will have their assets managed. either way we'll hit critical mass",2021-08-14 14:10:39
paoa08ce,I think tokenisation of all sorts of fiat cryptocurrencies are the next boom. That could blow up for sure. Forex is a $6.6T market and integrating that to the Blockchain would not make CeFi more efficient but also allow DeFi to go mainstream.

You can use MakerDAO, Curve, Flamingo, or any other DeFi project. Since Balanced is the newest, you'd earn the most rewards there though.

However, to downvote someone for answering the question is disingenuous. You would have likely been downvoting people for mentioning NFTs just three months ago, and those people could have made 1,000s of ETH for creating some NFTs or just buying some in the early days for cheap.

Can't even answer a basic question with a simple answer and a link to the actual project so people can investigate themselves without getting downvoted here these days. Then people wonder why it's so difficult to find information about crypto.

It's because any of the veterans that have been here a long time get downvoted or called a shill for simply answering a question and linking a project's website for others to review.

It's why I try not to be too informative anymore here. People only wanna talk about meme comments, and regurgitated the same ""coinbase sucks"" or ""not your keys not your coins"" posts every day.

civilian_discourse,"There's a concept called the blockchain trilemma, which refers to: security, decentralization, scalability. It's a trilemma because you only get to pick two. So, Ethereum's solution is to pick security+decentralization while accomplishing scalability by creating an ecosystem of blockchains that inherit all of their security from Ethereum. These chains are called rollups and can be effectively thought of as transaction compression.

This does mean however that there will be a major shift that takes place over the next few years, which I like to think of like this... In traditional finance, all non-cash transactions you make run through the federal reserve and typically take a week to finalize. For instance, sending money from your Wells Fargo bank account to your Robinhood account. Robinhood might cover up the week delay by crediting all or a portion of the amount you transferred, but it still takes a week for the actual transfer to finalize. Alternatively however, you might open a brokerage account with wellsfargo and send money to that! This transaction is instant because it's within Wells Fargo.

This is a strong analogy to the future of DeFi. Replace Wells Fargo with say Arbitrum One, Robinhood with say Loopring, and the Federal Reserve with Ethereum. In a very real way, the way things are setup today is like if everyone in the US was dealing directly with the Fed and everyone's individual accounts were handled directly by the Fed. Over the next few years, people will switch from dealing with Ethereum directly to dealing with rollups that finalize teansactions within themselves instantly and between each other over a period of a week. In some cases, this week will be covered up by a credit system, MakerDAO already has something in the works for this. But better yet, the technology will improve and that week will turn into hours. maybe less.",2021-08-15 20:35:57

cryptOwOcurrency,"I'm going to ignore the parts where you accuse me of trolling and BSing and assume you may still want to engage in a good faith argument.

&gt; Any logical person would say that this trade-off is obviously not worth it when comparing mass complaints about ETH tx fees for a year to a random person who might have found a problem on a month old smart contract testnet based on what a handful of other developers have produced so far. Nobody wants that choice. It's a huge stretch trying to argue that somehow failing transactions is a good thing.

Just choose not to use shared state.

&gt; Prove it. You claiming that ETH can scale better based on a guess and that Cardano will have similar problems based on nothing means absolutely nothing.

These are fundamental blockchain scaling problems that underpin *every* chain. Do you know what state growth is? Again, Ethereum has a plan to tackle it, I haven't seen any plan from Cardano.

&gt; IOHK claims Cardano can scale much better and when Ouroboros is optimized they can theoretically reach 1000 tps. Besides that the eUTxO model (which is very different when it comes to scalability) is easier to scale and Hydra will reduce fees to near zero.

Ethereum team says all sorts of nice things about their scaling methods too. Anyone can get pie in the sky if they look far enough into the future. The rollups + data sharding roadmap can bring Ethereum to 100k+ TPS according to Vitalik.

I contest that eUTxO is easier to scale in practice, even though it may be more parallelizable in theory. Fact is that Ethereum team is scaling too.

&gt; The thread you linked shows it will be much less of a problem. But oke.

It shows that Cardano and Ethereum are on level ground, because all the arguments in the thread apply to both.

&gt; And you are again assuming nobody can build a DEX without a centralized matcher based on experience of a handful of devs on a month old testnet. That's quite an assumption.

You assuming that an architecture breakthrough will come out of the radio silence is bold.

&gt; Lol. Are you trolling? Here, so everyone can read for themselves what Vitalik says and not be fooled by some bs language you are using

Adding key rotation, which isn't inherently related to delegation but allows delegations systems to be built more efficiently than they can already be built today (without the exit delay), is totally different than hard-coding a delegation system into the protocol. But I think we are too far into the semantics on this point.

&gt; I really feel like you are just trying to bs people. Stoner Cats buyers just lost $800k in failed transactions because of an issue with the minting contract. OBVIOUSLY this doesn't happen on Cardano because it has native assets and that makes it superior. You have less complexity and risk. An ERC20 (or others) smart contract can fail, native assets can't.

ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens cannot fail if you copy-paste a highly audited OpenZeppelin library and use that. The reason they failed was due to custom logic. On Cardano if you want your token to use custom logic, that is just as prone to failure as if you write custom logic on Ethereum.

&gt; Ask the many people who complain. The last complaint I randomly saw was someone trying to buy an NFT and didn't have money to pay a $80 fee and therefor missed the opportunity to make $1000 with the NFT.

That's how the fee auction market works. The chain is at FULL full capacity. A luxury that Cardano doesn't have to deal with right now.

&gt; When EIP-1559 was live transaction fees also went to ridiculous levels and everyone was complaining about it on social media.

Due to price volatility increasing transaction demand, unrelated to 1559.

&gt; People have been saying L2 solutions are here and solve all ETHs problems for a year now, yet I see complaints everywhere.

People complain about things. The big boy L2, Arbitrum, is launching in 2 weeks.

&gt; If it is all so easy and convenient then why is not every project switching immediately.

They are.

""Operationally, with over 250 teams requesting to come online for the developer mainnet, it’s going to take us into next week before we can onboard everyone, but this process is underway.""

The big ones, Uniswap, SushiSwap, Aave, Curve, Etherscan, Loopring, and MakerDAO, will be there at launch among others.

&gt; The inconvenient part is that they are all on different L2 solutions and it becomes a mess.

For the most part they are all on *all* L2 solutions, survival of the fittest.

&gt; They are obviously prioritizing the merge over sharding because sharding is much harder than they thought and they fell back to rollups to make things easy for them. ""Developers are focusing their efforts on this transition, and minimizing additional features that could delay this goal."". What a shitty philosophy you can blame all your mistakes on.

We'll have to disagree on this one.

&gt; Only 5% is staked.

And due to slashing protections, it's enough.

&gt; And stakers lost about $150M because they were forced to use a 3rd party to stake and stake keys were lost by these parties.

This speaks to that pool's architecture, not the Ethereum chain. It's perfectly possible to have a noncustodial withdrawal scheme at least since recently, see Lido.

&gt; you are obviously very biased

Good expository writing tries to present as many facts as possible and let the reader draw their own conclusions. What if I say I'm not biased and you're the one who's biased? Either of us can say anything, all that matters in the end are facts and opinions, which I am doing my best to present.

&gt; most of your criticism is based on very little experience with Plutus/eUTxO

On the contrary, my criticism is based on knowledge of eUTxO. I have an admittedly smaller amount of experience with Plutus, but nothing we've talked about has really brought Plutus into the conversation.

Lets say it is via eth.

So. Do you just sell most of it and pay tax? Or do you keep your eth and let it act as collateral so you can realize your gains a different way? Here is another quote I have saved below:




""When you're rich, you use other people's money to start projects. If your project kicks off, you end up not spending anything and only pay interest on the loan you took with other people's money. If your project fails, you just owe the money. Here's how:

Lets say you want to create a new marketing agency in New York City next year. You plan on staying there in your yacht. The office will cost $1M for the year. What you do is you go to Dutchbank and say, ""Hey I need a $1M loan. I will use my yacht as collateral. My yacht is worth $45M."" They actually say yes under the condition that the boat isn't allowed to leave port from near NYC, and you have to pay it back within 10 years. After 10 years they can sell the yacht and get back the $1M loan if they need to, pay you back $40M, and pocket $4M. You agree. Why? If your agency generates more than $2M, you can pay back the loan and pay next year's rent. At the end, you start you business and you didn't spend any money at all. You just couldn't move the boat.

These are called collateralized debt obligations. This is how MakerDAO works. The only difference is instead of a boat, you collateralized ETH. MakerDAO gives you Dai and your Eth gets parked. If you borrow too much without paying it back, it will sell your Eth. If you pay back the Dai you borrowed, you will get back your Eth. Because each Dai was created with an overcollateralized obligation, there's strong confidence that your Dai is at least worth $1 worth of Eth. The other nice part about MakerDAO is it's a robot bank. Anyone in the world can get any amount of a loan like this as long as they pay bank the Dai.""",2021-08-20 00:28:04

nikola_j,"Hey, u/TheCryptosAndBloods. I'll copy over a reply that I posted in the MakerDAO subreddit a few days ago for someone asking similar questions:

The Instadapp team introduced the INST governance token in June together with an airdrop for all Maker Vault owners at the point of their snapshot, but for anyone to be able to claim it - one had to migrate the Vault to their platform and their proxy, which is a migration that makes you lose compatibility with apps that stick to standard MakerDAO architecture based around the dsproxy, such as Oasis and DeFi Saver.

Initially, you could have manually done the process of migrating the Vault there to claim the airdrop and then migrating it, but in the meantime we also introduced a more convenient way for anyone who wants to claim the drop.

The new option you saw is a custom recipe containing multiple actions, including: migrating vault to instadapp, claiming  INST, migrating  vault back to dsproxy and (optionally) swapping INST and potentially adding it to your CDP as bonus collateral or using it to pay back some debt.

This kind person shared few bits on how the process looks for the user: [https://twitter.com/ncerovac/status/1422212747681488900](https://twitter.com/ncerovac/status/1422212747681488900)

Here are some random example transactions that complete this process:

* [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x71b1d7a12a46ef875de217243e9342a9f67e11ad3e52a43bbb91cc78b52954ed/advanced](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x71b1d7a12a46ef875de217243e9342a9f67e11ad3e52a43bbb91cc78b52954ed/advanced)

* [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5bb750540ab466b29d293f1ae94511a2e8a4d37a026c95680be6852f90eb2b0e/advanced](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5bb750540ab466b29d293f1ae94511a2e8a4d37a026c95680be6852f90eb2b0e/advanced)

By the way, a small curiosity - the Instadapp team made a snapshot of all Maker Vaults and then had maximum INST claim amounts set for accounts based on that snapshot. In case anyone's Vault balance went down after the snapshot, that also means there will be a decreased amount of INST available to claim. In order to maximize your claim, this custom recipe will also include a flash loan that tops up your Vault for the duration of the transaction, but only if needed. ([Here's](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3ff360362512fae1f6fbfe2073460c020182832b0440685214b02ffa7d3a930e) one example of such a transaction, too.)

There's been over 100 users who already claimed INST using DeFi Saver, so it's definitely legitimate and safe. If you do happen to get stuck (e.g. get a failing transaction warning) - by all means reach out so we figure it out.

(\*A recipe is any transaction combining multiple actions with any different protocols, in our new architecture.)

In terms of the number of unique CDPs in MakerDAO - that's currently at \~25,350 (can be checked at [https://defiexplore.com/stats](https://defiexplore.com/stats)). And some of them are empty and/or abandoned already, of course.

Also, just to clarify this a bit:

&gt;my ETH in a DefiSaver CDP

That CDP is still in the same MakerDAO protocol just as any other.

cryptOwOcurrency,"&gt; They probably meant algo stablecoin.

They should have said algo stablecoin.

&gt; By the way, have you looked into how their stablecoin works? I took a glance at it and it seems like they are backing $1 stablecoin with some amount of volatile crypto (like ADA), and if ADA crashes they sell reserve tokens to make up the difference or something.

That's spot on. It's like if MakerDAO were to skip the whole part about trying to always stay fully collateralized, and go right to the part where they mint more and more MKR as the price of the collateral drops. Really naive stablecoin design based on what I know about it, to me it looks like some of the failed attempts to create stablecoins before MakerDAO ([like Nubits](https://medium.com/reserve-currency/the-end-of-a-stablecoin-the-case-of-nubits-dd1f0fb427a9)), but time will tell.

&gt; Algo stablecoins are like trying to break the rules of physics in my opinion. You simply cannot back $1 of a stablecoin by &lt;$1 of assets consistently.

Back before MakerDAO (so, 2016-ish), I used to vehemently believe that stablecoins were impossible without being backed in a direct custodial way by the same asset they were tracking. MakerDAO's design showed me that you can back a stable asset by a volatile collateral through a system of debt positions. So since I know there can be breakthroughs that I'm not expecting, I haven't completely ruled out the possibility of a viable undercollateralized stablecoin, especially since that's basically what most fiat currencies are and it seems to work for them. Something bond-based, I remember reading about one attempt at one point but I can't remember what it was called.",2021-08-20 01:51:50

JacobLambda,"The implementation has them crypto-collateralised which is minorly different from but similar to being crypto-backed.

What this means is that with MakerDAO you put down a collateral for a DAI loan while with say SigmaUSD(one Djed impl) you instead trade your crypto for SigRSV (the reserve token) which generates ERG (Ergo's base currency) and the protocol then uses those reserves to back SigUSD's exchange value.

The explanation used to compare the two in the paper I think summarises it best:

&gt; Crypto-collateralized stablecoins, of which DAI is currently the most prominent example, are similar to crypto-backed stablecoins, with the subtle but important
difference, however, that cryptocurrencies are used to provide collateral for stablecoin-denominated loans instead of reserves. Similarly to how a house that serves as collateral
in a mortgage does not count as reserves in the bank that is providing the loan, the
collateral provided for the issuance of a crypto-collateralized stablecoin does not count
as reserve. Due to the lack of reserves, pure crypto-collateralized stablecoins resemble
an extreme form of fractional reserve banking (with a fraction of 0%). Unlike commercial bank money (i.e. money in a bank account), which can be exchanged at any time by anyone holding it for central bank money by withdrawing cash from the bank’s
reserves, crypto-collateralized stablecoins cannot be exchanged for anything by withdrawing from the stablecoin contract’s reserves, simply because there are no reserves.
When interacting with the contract, users can only use stablecoins to repay their own loans and recover their own collateral or to bid in auctions for liquidated collateral from others.",2021-08-20 03:47:28

**These are called collateralized debt obligations. This is how MakerDAO works. The only difference is instead of a boat, you collateralized ETH. MakerDAO gives you Dai and your Eth gets parked. If you borrow too much without paying it back, it will sell your Eth. If you pay back the Dai you borrowed, you will get back your Eth. Because each Dai was created with an overcollateralized obligation, there's strong confidence that your Dai is at least worth $1 worth of Eth. The other nice part about MakerDAO is it's a robot bank. Anyone in the world can get any amount of a loan like this as long as they pay bank the Dai.""**",2021-08-20 04:37:22

bomberdual,How does this compare with MakerDAO and Dai,2021-08-20 22:56:47
JacobLambda,"The short answer is that they have some pretty cool tech and are positioning themselves to serve the role of Chainlink, MakerDAO, and Uniswap in the EUTxO model ecosystem.

The longer answer:

Ergo is a proof of work smart contract platform using the EUTxO accounting model. There's a lot of brainshare between the teams that work on Ergo and the ones that work on Cardano so you'll see a lot of similar features and design choices between them. Additionally, since most of IOG's and EMURGO's research starts with PoW assumptions before moving to PoS and since Ergo tends to follow a bit more of a fast moving approach than Cardano, you'll find that Ergo gets used as an experimentation bed for a lot of cool projects that ultimately end up making their way into other projects in the EUTxO space.

As for what is positioning Ergo to fill those aforementioned roles:

Ergo has a rather interesting Oracle system called Oracle Pools that provides inbuilt governance mechanisms, improved resilience, and better resistance to certain types of attacks. This is one of the ""killer features"" of Ergo and I don't think I can sell it properly here so I'd recommend doing a proper dive on it.

The recently released Djed protocol paper used SigmaUSD as its initial implementation. SigmaUSD is a properly crypto-backed stablecoin. This differs from MakerDAO/DAI in that DAI is crypto-collateralised (crypto is used as collateral on DAI loans) which provides SigmaUSD some nicer security properties and provides a greater incentive for maintaining the peg.

Finally, the Ergo team is building out ErgoDEX which is a fully fledged multichain DEX with AMM and Order book support. The main chain will be Ergo of course but there is a full Cardano Plutus integration in progress as well.

TLDR: There's a number of cool projects being built on Ergo that have the potential to cement it as a key member of the slowly forming EUTxO model ecosystem.",2021-08-20 23:08:06

VandyILL,"I had been following the MakerDAO subreddit back in 2016-2017, and sometime that winter someone came in to ask about Radix’s proposed stable coin (old project priority) vs the DAI, and some queries about whether they could work well in the same ecosystem.

Checked out Radix and what appealed to me was how Dan was so focused on identifying exactly what problems need to be solved and what it’ll take to solve them.  It feels like the team is considering and solving problems that aren’t on other people’s radar, so the ability to think with that much foresight and dedicate so much planning (8+ years) to get it right was very appealing.  Since then whenever I see a new project I try to ask “what problems are they trying to solve” and that really helps me. I think this causes me to undervalue a lot of the actual DeFi projects as it’s more an evaluation approach for L1’s etc, but I’m okay not putting more $ into crypto just to be in more projects.

The RAI smart contracts use much of the same logic that DAI/MakerDAO does, so like with DAI, there is a risk of having your collateral ETH liquidated if the price of ETH falls.

Some differences with DAI:

1. You can use a saviour, a special smart contract that must be called before your collateral can be liquidated. This means you could have a contract that deposits more collateral and/or repays your debt in order to prevent liquidation.

2. RAI is not pegged to the price of USD

crypto-devk,"If the price of $ETH instantly drops by 10%, the price of $ETH2X-FLI will drop by 20% (although it would likely never be exactly 2x, since ETH2X-FLI is constantly re-balancing itself).

So essentially, each $ETH2X-FLI will be worth less $ETH if the value ETH/USD goes down in value. And vice versa if ETH/USD goes up.

If the price falls quickly enough (black swan event), there's also a super unlikely chance that the position doesn't re-balance fast enough (e.g. MakerDAO ""Black Thursday"" on March 12th 2020), but the creators of ETH2x-FLI claim they have protections from that, so it might be fine.

Other costs are:

  - interest, ETH2X-FLI is uses Compound to borrow USDC, so has to pay interest on that.
  - 2% streaming fee per year
  - [Volatility decay!](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/082515/why-leveraged-etfs-are-not-longterm-bet.asp). Rebalanced leverage funds or constantly buying high, selling low, so volatility will kill your returns, especially when they compound! This is a big one in crypto.

cali_dave,"Alright, I'll bite. 

&gt;Not only will Cardano's price dump tremendously on the day that their smart contracts ""release"" (let's see if they get delayed again), but not a single prominent and actively used dApp that actually has known, respected developers and hundreds of thousands of active users has committed to migrating from other chains to Cardano.

I'll refer you to [this link](https://github.com/input-output-hk/essential-cardano/blob/main/essential-cardano-list.md) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oBUiOLBrBg). The first link is to a fairly comprehensive outline of the Cardano ecosystem - everything from its partnerships to NFTs to oracles to DEXes and so on. It's massive. You may just find some familiar names in that list. The video is a clip of Charles himself talking about dapps on Ethereum and just how many of them are looking to migrate. The long and short of it is that all of the top 15 dapps on Ethereum have looked into migrating to another blockchain, and several are actively pursuing it. Also, only 31% of new dapps are deployed on Ethereum as opposed to other ecosystems. I think most people are tired of the high gas prices, and they are looking for an alternative. In my opinion, they're just waiting. They'll let others test the water then decide if they want to migrate or not afterwards. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Furthermore, none of the dApps that Cardano touts around in their ""ecosystem"" have working products or any hope of pulling developers or users from other networks. Who even uses anything that Cardano has in its ""ecosystem"" anyway? I'd love to know how many users and transactions occur on those dApps. Unless you see the likes of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, Synthetix, USDC, and Yearn talk about migrating to Cardano, there really isn't anything to talk about with regard to ""Cardano killing Ethereum"". Hint: they'll never migrate.

As you've pointed out, there are no dapps yet on the Cardano mainnet, so there are zero users and transactions as of yet. Can't argue that. However, there are a number of promising DEXes and liquidity providers (ErgoDEX, Liqwid, SundaeSwap, and others) that are building on the Alonzo testnet as we speak. They may not be the same names you mentioned, but they do have the support of the Cardano community, and there is a good deal of excitement surrounding them. In addition, there is a budding NFT ecosystem growing on Cardano. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I would be willing to bet that after a few months of smart contracts being live on Cardano, there will be scant activity on the network and Charles will be forced to bridge, and kneel to Ethereum, just like the rest of the ""Ethereum killers"" have.

There are already plans to bridge to (and from) the Ethereum network. One of the goals is cross-chain interoperability. There is an ERC-20 token converter in the works that will allow for easy migration to the Cardano blockchain, as well as a KEVM that will allow Solidity smart contracts to run on Cardano. In addition, projects like [occam.fi](https://occam.fi) are already building cross-chain liquidity protocols between Ethereum and Cardano. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;While Cardano was sleeping during the bear market and selling off their holdings to their bagholders who they promised a ""world changing protocol"", the projects I listed above continued to develop real, functioning applications

I disagree that Cardano was sleeping during the bear market. The academic approach you have so quickly dismissed has allowed them to build an insanely robust and correct system from the ground up. Each step has been meticulously peer-reviewed and scrutinized. Much of this work was done during the bear market. Ethereum historically has taken a ""move fast, break things, we'll fix it later"" approach.. hence the move to PoS with ETH2. Cardano has done the opposite - build it once, build it right. There are pros and cons to each method, but at the end of the day, you have to ask yourself whether you want your financial system built quickly or built correctly. 

For the record, Charles doesn't care much for the phrase ""Ethereum killer"", and neither do I. I think, as in all things, a balance will be found. Once people discover that smart contracts can run on Cardano faster and cheaper than on Ethereum, some will migrate, and some won't. The ones that do migrate will take some of the pressure off the Ethereum network and gas prices will fall. 

I'm not entirely sure why you're so hateful towards Cardano (if you don't like it, don't use it), but I'll say that the blockchain space is big enough for everybody. Right now, at a time when governments across the world are seeking to embrace, regulate, or destroy crypto.. there is no room for tribalism amongst the larger crypto community.",2021-08-22 13:53:27

SwagtimusPrime,"&gt;It's clearly a very big and active community which you can easily see if you looked but you clearly don't care and just want to shit on ADA and it's community.

It's a very active and big community of retail investors looking to score the next big thing. Developers? Barely any.

&gt;It's a community that controls $80B vs communities that control about $5B. These people can use their ADA to provide liquidity or use it in many other smart contracts or trade it for tokens of other projects build on top of Cardano. This is basic knowledge. Do you also think that a company with a huge market cap doesn't have more resources than a company with a much smaller market cap?

Maybe you need to work on your writing skills because ""using a marketcap on projects"" sounds very idiotic.

&gt;You don't even understand what I am talking about. It's a decentralized treasury build into the Cardano blockchain which token holders control and which funds new projects every six weeks. There are only a couple of chains who have something similar and on a much smaller scale than Cardano.

I know exactly what you're talking about, I was just commenting on the war chest's size.

&gt;Or Avalanche spending it on bad marketing strategies like paying DeFi protocols to boost their adoption.

I'll come back to this comment once Cardano decides to do the exact same thing when it's struggling for relevancy. Looking forward to it.

&gt;I said, there are no other projects, projects that you compared to Cardano, who have this kind of traction.

Except for millions of users on Ethereum, and not some shady deal with a third world country that's about to be involved in a civil war.

&gt;You conveniently left out mentioning the outrageous transaction fees and people losing money on failed transactions which is just flat out bad design.

I actually have mentioned this, talking about the gas limit. Perhaps you need glasses?

&gt;So what? It's now far ahead in every aspect except adoption

You should become a comedian, seriously. It's behind in

1. EVM compatibility
2. smart contracts
3. oracles
4. adoption
5. developers
6. scalability (Hydra is years away)

&gt;except adoption which Ethereum has very little of in the grand scheme of things.

Ah yes, Ethereum has very little adoption. Looking forward to r/cardano celebrating the first dapp deployed and touting the massive adoption of Cardano. Wonderful!

&gt;No not for good reasons. Ethereum governance is heavily centralized around the developers

The EIP process is open for anyone, research is entirely in the public domain, core dev calls are public and anyone can attend.

&gt;and on-chain governance is easily a lot more decentralized and fair.

on-chain governance means whales dictate what happens because they own most of the coins. Want to see how bad this is? Take a look at the Uniswap governance. It's a hot mess. Vitalik will never warm up to on-chain governance on the base layer, and neither will anyone else in Ethereum.

&gt;Whatever floats your boat in your delusional magic world. Rollups and similar L2 solutions have been in development for years on Ethereum and everyone knows about them and is researching them but nobody is adopting them in the way Ethereum does (most likely because they were build on Ethereum as bandaid solutions while PoS and sharding was in development hell) and they are all looking into other L1 or L2 scaling solutions.

You have a severely distorted view of reality. Other L1 chains have been in ""development hell"" for years - no adoption, no users, no devs, no nothing. We are currently in year 6 of Ethereum killers trying to kill Ethereum and they all miserably fail.

The reason for why only Ethereum is adopting rollups is because Ethereum has some of the most brilliant minds in blockchain history working on it, who realize that it's simply the best solution out there. Want some examples?

the founder of Arbitrum - professor at Princeton, EFF Pioneer Award winner (arguably, there's no greater prize in computer science), and his last job before founding Offchain Labs was Dy. US CTO at the goddamn White House. Or the founder of StarkWare - research doctorate at Princeton, Harvard and MIT, inventor of STARKs, founder of Zcash - the first practical implementation of zero-knowledge proofs. Not that any of this means anything whatsoever. I'm sure Cardano has got this all figured out much better.

&gt;You can't fork Uniswap and deploy it on Cardano because Cardano uses a different ledger model, the Extended UTxO model. Maybe you can in the future when the KEVM sidechain is finished.

Please, dude, I know all of this. I was referring to the ghostchains that have done this before. And this btw doesn't bode well for Cardano - no EVM compatibility is just a death sentence. And a sidechain for EVM? A sidechain? Really? Sidechains are horrendously insecure and centralized. This is the best Cardano could come up with in all these years?

&gt;Just because Ethereum has a few, relatively speaking, succesful protocols that barely anyone uses means nothing at all. That kind of basic 'DeFi' functionality with very little users and without regulation is really not as hard as you try to make it out to be.

I can't take you serious. You have clearly not been into crypto for a long time. DeFi wasn't even a concept 2 years ago. It all started with MakerDAO figuring out a collateralized stablecoin tied to ETH - then Uniswap happened - the brainchild of Vitalik and Hayden Adams - then the rise of Compound by Robert Leshner, which at the same time introduced liquidity mining and governance over protocols. Just because you now know how to do all this stuff makes it easy, doesn't mean it was easy right from the beginning. Ethereum wrote history, Cardano wrote some papers in academia.

&gt;Roflmao. I just gave you tons of reasons why it's not working well. People lost millions if not billions of dollars because of Solidity bugs and bad protocol design. Everyone knows about this so you are not fooling anyone. ETH 2.0's design without delegation functionality (which was too difficult to implement from the start according to Vitalik) forced people to use centralized 3rd parties to stake with and people already lost $150M in 'rug pulls'/lost stake keys. If they just staked on Cardano they would've never even been in that position to begin with and they could move their tokens whenever they wanted and not get slashed because a staking service made a simple meaningless mistake during an update without any bad intentions (yes that also already happened).

&gt;Yeah right, it's just principles. Great principles forcing people to pay thousands if not tens of thousands in fees. Great principles designing a protocol so that when your transaction fails you still lose the fee for no good reason. What a joke, just like the ""it's feature not a bug"".

Transaction fee issues and failed transactions will be a thing of the past with rollups. While Cardano was doing.. what exactly? The giga brain researchers of Ethereum figured out how to build a trustless, decentralized second Layer protocol to fix all of the shortcomings.

The staking criticism is actually one I can understand to some degree, Cardano's staking is way more user friendly, but it relies on staking pools. Ethereum chose not to trade UX for decentralization, which in the long run is the correct decision.

&gt;More derailing. Why don't you figure it out if you care so much. All this information is publicly available.

This was an honest question.

Charles constantly talks about Ethereum and how broken it is. Stop kidding yourself.",2021-08-23 01:28:54
EWdirtbag_MX,"First, I will say that I don't believe that cardano will become an ""ethereum killer"" atleast not anytime soon. There simply is too much industries already backing and building on the ethereum network. However, I do believe cardano has plenty of room to thrive and prosper and adds real value to the world. 

&gt;I personally believe there are several solid alternatives to Ethereum (Polygon, Avalanche, Solana), but unless such networks have built a bridge to Ethereum, they likely will not survive. That is why all of the chains I mentioned were forced to develop bridges to Ethereum because no developer in their right mind would leave the Ethereum ecosystem for a risky sidechain or other layer 1 network. I do not think Cardano will be any different, but this is just my opinion.
&gt;

As a matter of fact, cardano is also building a ERC-20 bridge. Also, I think you seem to place value on a ecosystem solely on how much backers are already building on it. I will explain more below.

&gt;Unless someone can tell me otherwise, I am not aware of any actively used dApp that has committed to migrating from other chains to Cardano. Unless you see the likes of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, Synthetix, USDC, and Yearn talk about migrating to Cardano, there really isn't anything to talk about with regard to ""Cardano killing Ethereum"". Hint: they'll never migrate.
&gt;

They don't need to migrate, two or more ecosystems can coexists especially when they provide solutions to different problems (Atila Prism Identification Solution) and cardano has many dApps of their own. Personally I think it will be a long time before we reach a point of 1 world currency (if we ever do), the race is still close amongst many and there is still much innovatiom to come, Not to mention approx. 1% of the worlds capital is in crypto at the moment. (plenty of room for growth.)

&gt;I'm posting this because I'm getting sick of the manic Cardano threads where bagholders are desperately trying to get others to buy so the price goes higher and they can sell. Yes, they are scheduled to release smart contracts soon, but the biggest question remains, ***who is going to use their platform***? I have seen extraordinarily innovative developments being made on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, and those did not happen overnight and it's hard to imagine people just packing up their bags and leaving to work on Cardano.
&gt;

Ok so in regards to getting sick of cardano manic threads asking ppl to buy, I'm not on this sub often but I would be sick of it too. It's an investment, they should learn the skill of patience. You're right those developers will have to make a decision to just continue on the etheruem network or branch off and expand their platform with bridges to other viable networks. What makes you think they have to choose one only? I mean certainly, they can but they will be behind thier competition when they start expanding out to other viable strong networks.

&gt;To all of the people about to yell at me for making another ""Cardano is overhyped post"" I want you to take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror: have you ever actually *used* Ethereum? Polygon? Avalanche? Solana? Have you ever actually *used* a decentralized exchange, lending protocol, NFT marketplace/game, or provided liquidity to these networks? I have. I've done all of it. So do you really have the perspective to be arguing about ""Ethereum killers"" and how ""great"" Cardano will be when you don't even have experience with engaging and interacting with smart contracts?
&gt;

Yeah I agree, it's not an ""eth killer"" nor do I think any blockchain will kill eth in the near future. I havevnt used any defy but i assure you I have researched on how to use them and how they work, specifically, lido,curve,yearn, blockify, opensea, etc. You don't need to use a platform to see how great its value is or can be. Instead it requires creative/critical thinking.

&gt;Where is all of your hype really coming from, the echo chambers on Twitter and Reddit? I'm asking because I fell for the same ""academic scientific approach"" marketing in 2017 and it's just the same cycle over and over again - Cardano is great at making money during bull markets, but not very good at delivering promised products, but I really hope I'm wrong this time.
&gt;

Atila Prism Identification Solution is honestly enough to be bullish on cardano. Much of africa has a problem of not being able to provide simple birth certificates to their citizens and other documentation. This allows people to essentially have a virtual ID portfolio on the blockchain that governement offices and services can lookup and verify. Birth cert., Drivers Lic., Diplomas, Title of houses,. All you need is a smartphone, which surprisingly enough, a good portion of the populace has. The rest can access via a cheap computer at some government location. This is a much cheaper alternative to the traditional infrastructure that would be needed in place to do such tasks and more secure considering the high crime rates in some parts of africa. Ethopia has ALREADY partnered with cardano for this solution. If this is successful, I predict many more african governments will follow suite. Do you know how many people will be forced to interact with the cardano network now? There is no other blockchain branching out to africa, (which is honestly an insane blunder.)

Lastly, keep in mind cardano as of right now, can handle 266tps vs etheruems 13tps, its gas fees are a fraction of etheruems and its based off a PoS system which offers far more scalability and energy effeicency. Yes etheruem 2.0 is on the way, but cardano also has updates on the way to improve even further.

It seems to me the big advantage ETH has is being ""first come first serve"" so they have more backers. ADA has the advantage of being in a better position on network effiecency and usability. when ADA has smart contracts release there will be apoint in time on paper where ADA is the superior platform. TPS, GAS, SCALABILITY, while offering smart contracts. That is until eth 2 comes out then it evens out again. Plenty of developers will see value in that.

Personally,, I hold both ETH and ADA and am bullish on both :P

Beechbone22,"""DAI maintains its value not by being backed by U.S. dollars custodied by a company""

LMAO my fucking sides

DAI is just USDC with extra steps. When 60% of the collateral backing your decentralized stablecoin is a centralized and custodial stable, your decentralized stablecoin might not be as decentralized as you think. Any sort of USDC peg failure will result in the failure of DAI and MakerDAO. It's literally an existential problem for the protocol. DAI is no more decentralized than USDC and holding DAI is even more risky IMO due to the added layer of smart contract vulnerability risk + protocol insolvency risk. The worst of both worlds, yay! Centralization risk due to being collateralized by a custodial stable and the added risk of smart contract vulnerability + the risk that MakerDAO may become insolvent due to their incredibly inefficient method for liquidations.

I like DAI and I don't have problems with custodial stables like PAXOS or USDC, but let's not pretend that DAI is anything resembling decentralized. If USDC fails, it takes down DAI and MakerDAO with it.

If you want to experience much greater capital efficiency, true decentralization and zero interest rate, you might want to give Liquity a try. LUSD is much more decentralized than any custodial stablecoin, more stable than algorithmic stables and other decentralized stables due to more efficient liquidations and how it can allow immediate arbitrage opportunities. All fully backed 100% by ETH and NOTHING ELSE. The protocol can never change and add more options to the collateral pool because it's a finished product and there is no governance. The protocol token gives no governance right and only generates cashflow.

If you want to go even further down the scale of decentralization you can use RAI. Still backed by ETH and decentralized but not pegged to any single world curency.",2021-08-23 23:01:07
UglandHouse,"Copy / paste from one of my earlier posts that explains what DAI is, quite brilliant.

&gt;For example, MakerDAO aims at replicating a traditional lending platform.  
Here's how it works: you send your ETH to a collateralised debt position (referred to as a CDP)—it's just a smart contract. The MakerDAO protocol locks up your ETH, and creates (out of thin air) something called Dai, the protocol's stablecoin; soft-pegged 1:1 against the USD. The peg is maintained by|from the ETH backing all of the minted Dai. The collateralization rate is currently 150%, meaning that you can borrow up to 66% of your locked up ETH in Dai. Once you send your ETH and receive Dai, interest is generated on the amount borrowed—referred to as the stability fee. The only way to close the contract, and get back your ETH is to pay back the Dai generated, plus the interest. The Dai is then burned, as is the governance token on the interest accrued.  
Why would you want Dai? Leverage, stability, payment for goods and services, tax scenarios, etc.  
The Maker token (MKR) holders are individuals who retain rights to vote on certain parameters in the MakerDAO protocol (i.e., the stability fee). It is very similar to how the federal reserve controls the USD, and conducts monetary policy; namely through the Federal Funds Rate (FFR). There are also certain covenants in the MKR token to ensure that the protocol runs smoothly, very similar to the ""lender of last resort"" concept.  
Bitcoin isn't useful in any capacity whatsoever, it was just nascent technology.",2021-08-24 00:26:00
justgolife,"Bankless have been pushing the DAO narrative over the last week... Interview with Kain from Synthetix and some others were pretty insightful, like, they are claiming that Synthetix wasn'T really a DAO in the beginning, neither was MakerDAO... That blew my mind.

BraveNewDeFi,"If you purchase Protocol Cover for Anchor on Terra, your deposits on Anchor are protected against a loss of funds in the event that:

* Code is used in an unintended way (e.g., a hack or exploit) 
* Assets are liquidated due to economic design failure (e.g., like the [MakerDAO Black Thursday event](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/black-thursday-response-thread/1433))
* Assets are liquidated or lost due to severe oracle failure or oracle price manipulation
* A governance attack occurs that leads to a loss of funds within the protocol

With Protocol Cover, you get cross-chain protection under one policy. You can read more about [Protocol Cover](https://nexusmutual.gitbook.io/docs/users/types-of-cover#protocol-cover) in the Nexus documentation. 

The cost for cover is 2.6% per annum, but 10% of your premium is reserved for claims filing and can be withdrawn 35 days after cover expiry. Because members can file claims for up to 35 days after a cover policy expires (for a loss within the covered period), the 10% reserved for claims filing can be withdrawn on the 36th day after expiry. This means the real cost of Nexus cover is 2.34% per annum.

Members often ask how they would file a claim in the event a loss of funds within Anchor's smart contract system occurred. There is a guide within the Nexus documentation that walks through the process of [How to File a Claim](https://nexusmutual.gitbook.io/docs/how-to-use-nexus/how-to-file-a-claim-1). If you file a claim, the Nexus UI guides you through the process, and to provide proof of loss, the Nexus UI will direct you to sign into your Terra wallet and sign a transaction or send a 0 value transaction to prove ownership of the wallet. From there, the UI will direct you through the rest of the claims process as detailed in the How to File a Claim section. 

If you'd like to read about past claim payouts, you can review the [Claims History](https://nexusmutual.gitbook.io/docs/claims-assessment/claims-history) section of the Nexus documentation.

To date, the mutual has paid out $2.5mm in successful claims. The last claim payout was for the Yearn yDAI hack in Feb 2021. Amount paid out: $2,410,499.26 USD (1,351 ETH + 129,660 DAI).",2021-08-25 05:17:07

ethereumflow,"Banks are insured by a corrupt system. Crypto exploits are not insured (except centralized exchanges and Thorchain). 

Exploits point out flaws or issues that need to be corrected. That’s how we end up with new blockchains. 

Different blockchains will do different things and appeal to different people. That’s why sovereignty is so important. Applications may not want to build on one blockchain because of protocol decisions that may affect their application (Aragon pending migration from Ethereum for example). Polygon itself is an example of a multi-chain world. Moving from Ethereum to Polygon to use the dapps that prefer the features available on Polygon that maybe don’t require the security of an app like AAVE or MakerDAO. These applications (Aavegotchi, Axie Infinity among others) can run on a “less secure” chain that fulfills their specific needs. 

Why more smart contracts platforms? Solidity is one of the main reasons. There’s a reason other chains aren’t launching written in Solidity. Developers want to write code in languages they are familiar with using tools they’re comfortable with. Many of the alternative smart contract platforms are using common languages known by more devs from outside the space. JUNO smart contracts will be in Rust, CosmWasm and Go; Agoric smart contracts will be written in hardened JavaScipt, the most popular programming language out there. Why would a new to blockchain developer spend time learning a new, complex language when they can code in languages they know? 

Blockchains empower communities with the tools need to create local economies. Any community that wants to run their own blockchain can do so and connect to an interconnected network of independent and sovereign blockchains. 

Checkout this post, it gives a much better explanation than I can about a multi chain world and how it can work.

coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; MakerDAO is a decentralised platform that allows anyone, anywhere to generate DAI stablecoin against crypto collateral assets. MakerDAO has created a protocol allowing anyone with ETH and a Metamask wallet to lend themselves money in the form of DAI. Stablecoins such as USDC, USDT and DAI offer traders and investors a way out of crypto market volatility and provide stability within the digital asset economy.

Wokeman1,"Great question. For something to be considered a security there has to be proof that you bought into something expecting it to increase in value over time which excludes stablecoins since their price is fixed. You're more likely to see regulations from the Treasury (if they become registered as an alternate currency) or the CFTC (if it becomes regulated as a commodity, similar to bitcoin). 

The thing that makes me feel better is that Circle (backer of USDC) is trying to go public and become a regulated bank of sorts so it's very transparent and trying to be compliant. DAI is operated by MakerDAO (DAO = distributed/decentralized autonomous organization). The Maker foundation (the governing organization) has disbanded in its attempts to become more decentralized and Maker is governed by holders of the Maker token. Since DAOs dont have a normal hierarchy like a traditional business and being that they are such a new type of business I don't expect congress to pass serious laws on them for sometime. 

The few places that have passed DAO laws (Wyoming is one I believe) are very pro innovation and I see these state laws being used as a foundation by which fed laws will be based upon kind of like how prior rulings in a court system influence future rulings. This makes me hopeful that DAOs wont get hit nearly as hard as other cryptocurrencies that could absolutely fall into the unregistered security section of the law which the SEC oversees. I believe the Ripple vs SEC case that's going on right now will really set a lot of precedent going forwards of how the SEC determines if something is a digital security or not. And finally, please stay away from USDT, there's been waaaaaay too much sketchy stuff that's come to light recently that raises some questions of the overall liquidity of it. 

FYI, you can also move cash (dollars, pounds, and euros) into nexo but u have to wire transfer them and it's so much easier to use stablecoins IMO.",2021-08-28 04:52:41
nikola_j,"&gt;For one thing, as far as I know, there is still no user-friendly way to do this.

We actually have an interface available where you can take flash loans from Aave or dYdX and utilize them for whatever you see fit in combination with other defi protocols.

We called this the ""Recipe Creator"" and you can try it out at: [https://app.defisaver.com/recipes](https://app.defisaver.com/recipes). The introduction post is here: [https://medium.com/defi-saver/introducing-the-defi-saver-recipe-creator-34d4c26630c](https://medium.com/defi-saver/introducing-the-defi-saver-recipe-creator-34d4c26630c)

What's this useful for and what you can you use a flash loan for?

Well, we use flash loans in a bunch of leveraging and refinancing actions for defi lending positions. Here's one example how you can, for example, move a position from one protocol to another using flash loans.

Let's assume you have a MakerDAO ETH Vault and you wan't to move that whole position (a position with ETH deposited and DAI borrowed) to Compound. This is how you can do that:

* You flash borrow DAI (e.g. 50,000 DAI, if that's your current debt)
* You pay back debt in MakerDAO
* You withdraw ETH from MakerDAO
* You deposit ETH into Compound
* You borrow (50,000) DAI from Compound
* You pay back the falsh loan with this Dai

Voila! You have successfully refinanced your loan and moved it to a completely different protocol with a completely different set of conditions - something you'd never be able to do in traditional finance, or at least certainly not in one, single transaction taking you potentially under a minute :)",2021-08-28 05:42:37

tranmear,"What do you mean by interest fee? MakerDAO denominates interest in DAI added to the overall debt so that would be included in the 50,000 DAI loan",2021-08-28 14:19:04
nikola_j,"I would hate to come across as an illegible defi-elitist or anything like that.

Here's an attempt at an ELI5 of this process:

A flash loan is a new concept introduced by defi that allows anyone to borrow potentially unlimited (or at least tremendously huge) amounts of funds for whatever operation, as long as all of those funds are also returned by the end of that same transaction.

One use case for flash loans is moving an existing long-term borrowing made in DeFi from one protocol to another. For example, if you have deposited ETH into MakerDAO and borrowed DAI, you can utilize a flash loan to move that loan from the Maker protocol to the Compound protocol, for example.

This is done by utilising a flash loan to clear debt in the first protocol, moving funds from the first to the second protocol, and then borrowing the same amount of funds from the second protocol to pay off the flash loan.

Why would you want to do this? Well, maybe the second protocol is offering lower borrowing rates on the asset you have borrowed. Or maybe the second protocol started offering liquidity incentives - token rewards given just for using the protocol and having your funds in it. There could be a number of reasons.

Still not an ELI5, but hopefully works as an ELI15. Let me know if I can clarify a specific step more!",2021-08-28 18:28:29
nikola_j,"Well, what I mentioned earlier is an interface that allows users to create custom combinations of actions, including flash loans and what not. A UI where users are expected to put together the puzzle for their transaction, so to say, is defintiely not a mainstream thing. That's meant for highly advanced users who have unique combinations of actions in mind.

But for the mainstream, we're always working on 1-click/1-transaction options for all sorts of things.

For example, what I described earlier is also available in our Loan Shifter interface at DeFi Saver, where one can just select an existing MakerDAO position on the left and the target protocol on the right and just click ""shift"" - the frontend handles everything for them and that single quick transaction gets their position across to a completely different protocol

There are other teams working on similar things, too, of course. And the UX available to DeFi users is getting better by the day, really. If we compare any defi app from 2018 or 2019 to somethig that's been updated regularly or launched recently... The improvements are very noticeable.",2021-08-28 19:04:42

Plus-EV,"Spoke to a guy a week ago who made early retirement money during the 2017 run. Reason why I take his opinion seriously is he made the bulk of his money during the 2018-2020 period when it was a bear market. He cashed out long before this bullrun really got going and still came out with 7 digits. This was his take on the current cycle:

* SOL, not ADA will be the Ethereum of this run. He said this as it was crossing the $40 mark so seems like he's right short term.
* A lot of people clown on ICP because of the name, centralization and it's massive dump but it is actually a very good project tech wise. It's kinda in the same situation that /r/CC thinks ALGO is in, once people stop dumping it will rocket.
* Speaking about ALGO, doesn't really follow it. 
* If this cycle can extend into late '2022, then BTC will top out around 250K. At that point he'd sell and wait until it dumps to around $40-50K. If you are heavy into alts, you sell around that mark and rebuy in later.  
* He is an Ethereum guy. I wouldn't say he's a maximalist but he has said many times over the years that he was most bullish on Ethereum because that's the only coin he sees a real world use case for besides just hodling. He was talking about defi as a concept really early before things like MakerDAO were a thing so this was surprising to hear from him: The longer Ethereum goes without addressing the fee problem, the better it will be for the overall ecosystem because the ETH alternatives this time around actually have large userbases, ecosystems and use cases ready to go. The last time around alternatives like Neo and Stratis but way less users and no real use cases. Now that coins have lots of users plus DeFi and NFTs are a thing there are reasons to buy other coins. 
* 1 BTC will not be enough to retire but it puts you in a very good position when you do decide to retire in ~30-40 years. Everyone should aim to own at least 1BTC. Ironically he himself owns 0 BTC. He says ETH is in the too big to fail category now so he's fine owning ETH but he also has a larger stack than most people due to earlier adoption. If you're getting in now, 1BTC should be the goal. If you wanna do it with ETH, 32-50 ETH should be the goal. 
* People are overly focused on technical issues. Tech for the most part can be solved even if it's late. Moderna's stock price has exploded this year for instance, nobody really remembers all the issues it faced while developing the vaccine, just that it was delivered and it worked. This is why he isn't worried about ETH in the long term. The real issues in crypto are economic, intergration into mainstream society and regulatory risks. You can address one of them with tech but the other two are largely social and political issues.",2021-08-28 22:58:56

nikola_j,"Why not? Here's a few examples:

* A car bought with a loan made with MakerDAO: [https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/aume7m/interview\_with\_the\_makerdao\_dev\_who\_took\_out\_a/](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/aume7m/interview_with_the_makerdao_dev_who_took_out_a/)
* A car bought with a (self-repaying!) Alchemix loan: [https://twitter.com/iqbalmatyaakob/status/1414053017439989762](https://twitter.com/iqbalmatyaakob/status/1414053017439989762)

The process, as it is now, would have to involve depositing crypto to make a loan (in stablecoins) that you can then convert to fiat if wanted.

And the main reason to do something like that being that you remain exposed to a potential value growth of your crypto assets. If you make a loan against your ETH and ETH grows 10x in a matter of a year or two - you can either pay back the debt and get your full ETH amount back or ""self liquidate"" and clear that debt with a fraction of your initially deposited ETH.",2021-08-29 03:47:43
nikola_j,"Ah, ok, I see what you mean.

In terms of fees, two types of fees should be considered:

* Transaction fees - these don't have anything to do with the falsh loan specifically, but they are mandatory and cannot be avoided. A transaction fee is usually paid no matter whether the transaction fails or not. And as OP mentioned, these kinds of transactions are complex, which means that they are gas intensive, which again means that they can become very costly. If we're talking about Ethereum, this can easily be in multiple hundred dollars worth of ETH (so 0.1 - 0.5 ETH or maybe even more, really depends on the number of actions in the transaction).
* Protocol fees for the flash loans - these will depend on the protocol from which the flash loan is being taken. Some of the options include:
   * Aave - which currently has a 0.09% fee on any flash loans (and they have the highest variety of assets available for flash loaning)
   * MakerDAO - which currently has a 0.05% fee on flash minting Dai (but DAI is the only available asset)
   * dYdX - which had flash loan fees at no fees whatsoever (with ETH, DAI and USDC available for flash loaning)
   * WETH10 - not a protocol per se, but the latest WETH (wrapped Ether) token contract allows for flash minting any amount of ETH at no fees whatsoever

In order for your transaction to complete successfully, you need to return the full amount required by the protocol from which you took the flash loan or where you performed the flash mint, and that amount will depend on whether the source used has any required fees.

Arbitrage is one of the most obvious use cases, but certainly not the only one as OP originally suggested. To complete a successful arbitrage in defi you have to find a noticeable price disparity in some assets on multiple dexes and hope that you make your play quickly enough. This is a field that's largely dominated by bots nowadats, as OP mentioned, and it's usually a game not worth playing, as you could quickly end up losing funds on failed transactions.

In terms of other use cases, I mentioned loan refinancing, but then another use case is for what some call ""self liquidation"".

For example, let's say you have a collateralized debt position with 10 ETH deposited into Compound and 5,000 USDC borrowed. What you can do is self liquidate that position using a flash loan: you make a flash loan of 5,000 USDC, you use that to clear your debt in Compound, you take out your 10 ETH, swap \~1.5 ETH for 5000+ USDC and then use this USDC to pay back the flash loan. This way you can clear your debt without having the borrowed funds and you walk away with the remaining \~8.5 ETH. This is especially useful when leveraging (longing/shorting) assets using lending protocols (as described [here](https://medium.com/defi-saver/how-to-long-or-short-any-asset-using-defi-lending-protocols-812300c9a640), for example).

I know it may sound complicated when explained like that, but the cool thing is that some apps have this available for users at a click of a button. For example we call this feature ""Repay"" in DeFi Saver and it's available in the dashboards of all defi lending protocols we have supported (Maker, Compound, Aave, Reflexer and Liquity).",2021-08-29 04:05:29

Where's the l2beats.com of these other chains? Where are all of the zero knowledge rollups and stark proofs for scaling? You need to compress data to include it in a block in a decentralized network in order to scale. Otherwise you can increase the block size, but then you increase node requirements and decrease decentralization. 

So where are these other competitor L1s working on L2s? Because that's where the future is, and they're already massively behind.

Right now I trade perpetual futures on every coin on dydx's perpetual L2 exchange. It's instant settlement, and secure by the Ethereum mainnet. Where's the Cardano equivalent ot dydx? Or how about the Solana equivalent?

If I compare this to the MakerDao Forum or Compound forum there is such a gulf in knowledge and professionality its incredible.

I wonder how big Cardano can become on speculation alone. I had no freaking idea how hollow and faulty the network is. After learning about Cardano more in the last week, I would say that Cardano has no business being in the top 10 coins.

Cardano as a Smart Contract platform looks like it is doomed to fail, Its supposed to break EVM supremacy but it has so many systemic problems and ontop of that Plutus/Haskell and a seemingly uninformed community. I dont see how they can possibly succeed.",2021-08-30 05:28:44

Recently integrated with Liquity and passed proposal to be integrated into Instadapp. DYOR, but personal opinion is that this could be huge over time.

Giel-GoodGhosting,"If the community wants this, we can definitely launch such a pool yes. So far we haven't received much requests for it. We initially started with DAI because back in June this gave the best interest rates and we do like the (mostly) decentralized approach of MakerDAO.

At this moment, we can do stablecoin pools with: USDT, USDC, DAI.  
And we can do volatile pools with MATIC, WETH, WBTC and AAVE.  
Hopefully in the near future also a pool using GHST ;)",2021-09-01 21:16:45
pewpewtehpew,"If ANY of you are even considering taking  profits I would consider using something like MakerDAO instead.  It allows you to basically ""take profits"" but not actually sell and miss out on any gains in the future, AND, it's not a taxable event. :)",2021-09-01 22:08:21
upscaleHipster,"Most MKR was bought with ETH (or, indirectly, DAI from ETH locked in CDPs). Those are the pairs with the most liquidy across exchanges. To see 1 MKR dropping under 1 ETH represents a huge failure for MakerDAO. There were plenty of times when this ratio was 5x in Maker’s favor. Every MKR holder lost those potential gains by exchanging their ETH.",2021-09-01 22:31:07
LudicrousOracle,"MakerDAO has failed hugely. While ETH continues to deliver new improvements and upgrades MakerDAO has little to show for being one of the oldest defi projects. Not only that, but they constantly keep diverting fees away from MKR holders and paying themselves exorbitant amounts of money (30mm+$). They keep doing everything they can to delay or reduce the burn function and constantly look to take funds from the surplus buffer. The surplus buffer was meant to bail out bad risk, but instead it's being used to pay whoever they want. The corruption in the system is evident. You would be wise to sell your MKR for ETH if you haven't already. Keep in mind that MKR has 1/100 of the supply of ethereum, it should be 100x the price but its not due to the failures of MakerDAO to deliver value.",2021-09-02 00:55:08

4rch3r,"&gt; Not only that, but they constantly keep diverting fees away from MKR holders and paying themselves exorbitant amounts of money (30mm+$).

Whaaaa??  You do realize MakerDAO is a weighted democracy in that the holders are voting for what will help MKR the most in the long run.  There's no one entity that is ""paying itself"" money.

&gt; They keep doing everything they can to delay or reduce the burn 

I think the current thinking is that it's a bull market (read potentially overbought) so we should collect as much DAI as possible now so that we can burn tokens when they're cheaper.  In the long run this should hopefully burn up MORE MKR at the cost of not burning now.  If you don't agree I highly recommend participating in https://forum.makerdao.com

&gt; MKR has 1/100 of the supply of ethereum, it should be 100x the price

Why should MKR have the same market cap as ETH?  It's just a piece of the ETH ecosystem in terms of value so it definitely makes sense to be less in terms of total market cap.  That's almost like saying Pixar should be worth the same as Disney in terms of market cap (which is impossible because pixar is just a subsidiary of Disney).",2021-09-02 08:18:29
roadydick,Maybe you can get a MakerDAO loan,2021-09-02 14:21:55

MoneyPowerNexis,"&gt; In the absence of legal tender law I have no issue with a system like that.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; What do you mean by that? Don't we have those laws?

MakerDAO would be a pretty close approximation of a currency system that lends currency into existence. It is not benefitting from legal tender law, you are not able to force any one to accept it for the payment of all debts public or private and it has no special status as a currency for paying taxes with. It is just a private currency with its own rules that you can either use or not use and because no one is coerced to use it none is forced to take a loss if it fails or suffer a loss of value if it inflates. But I have that opinion more generally: if any corporation or individual wants to make a currency of any kind so long as they are also not benefitting from special government treatment and not committing fraud. Even if the currency is a bad product if it is marketed honestly I have no issue with its existence although I might tell people it is a bad investment.

In addition to that I think there should be no legal tender law.  I probably wont get my way on that one in my lifetime so I am stuck talking about hypotheticals or periods in history before central banking like under the gold standard where free banking was a thing in most western countries. 

&gt;Can you give one example of this round about exploitation, so I know better what you mean?

One big issue is the transfer of wealth to people who get access to new money before other people. They get to spend the money before the value of the money is bid down. [Seigniorage can be used as a tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage#Seigniorage_as_a_tax). Another issue is the information asymmetry between central and member banks and everyone else. These institutions know ahead of time if interest rates will be high or low to an extent because they set interest rates to an extent. That information puts them at an incredible advantage in the markets, by them I mean insiders. Also being able to decide where in an economy credit is extended is open to abuse. Not only can banks pick and choose sectors of the economy to inflate, the central bank has no way of being punished for creating bubbles whether that is through incompetence or insider greed. 


 &gt;Kind of dystopian to me. Wouldn't people fear to experiment?

Its not a binary switch. If wealth was less concentrated towards the creators of money then experimentation would just shift outward in my opinion and while I do think it would be less wasteful and more targeted I dont think gambling would stop. If anything more asymmetric bets could happen since more people would have the resources to make diverse investments (and again just because that might happen more doesn't mean people cant still pool resources) The important thing to me is that wealth is not coercively concentrated in the first place after that people can make their own decisions on what to invest in as they do now but more so.",2021-09-02 16:49:13
helloeddy83,You don’t like the idea of using MakerDAO to get DAI?,2021-09-02 17:05:01
dynamyt3,"most people would stake over leveraging. i personally 3x leveraged long my entire stack of eth 30 from 3150. now i have 39 ish eth. I plan to 3x long my whole stack around the time of the merge, because there will be a further shock in eth supply because of the reduced issuance. i wouldn’t use more than 2x leverage if you’ve never used it before, since you have to be better with your entry/and exit points the more leverage you use.

CrazybutSolid,"I thought of a strategy to materialize gains without paying taxes in the US and keep the exposure. Please help me find the flaws in my plan:

1) Deposit 10 ETH in [OAsis.app](https://OAsis.app)

2) Borrow at today's rate 10k DAI

3) Exchange 10k DAI for 10k USD

4) Profit.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I gather (https://tokentax.co/guides/defi-crypto-tax/) I should not pay taxes at all since technically I have not made any gains

I never intend to pay the loan. Three scenarios:

* ETH goes up: I take out more DAI and repeat steps above. Still not taxable right?
* ETH goes down: MakerDao liquidates part of my ETH to pay back my debt, I should pay taxes, but normally I won't since ETH's value is lower than when I bought it
* My debt catches up with the minimum collateral %: MakerDAO liquidates. If ETH went down, no taxes. If ETH went up, I do have to pay taxes, but ETH had gone up so I can probably afford it without sweating it

What am I missing?

The only ""catastrophe"" is if crypto goes down 80% like it does every X years. I would lose a lot of my crypto, but I have materialized gains in my bank account/somewhere else and there I can reinvest again if I think it will come back up.",2021-09-04 22:31:53

Essentially if you wanted to cash out 5,000 you could open up a CDP with say: 15,000 worth of collateral. Then you mint 5,000 DAI, sell it for fiat and now you have $5000ish.  If the price goes up you can rebuy it at that price, if it goes down and is below the over collateralization ratio it would get liquidated and you would have to pay a fee (13% I think).

I'm in a similar boat as you, held through the 2017/2018 crash, the only reason I am considering this is because since I found smart contracts in 2017 I've been a big fan of the technology and I still am!",2021-09-05 23:55:03

I was extremely worried that something would go wrong, but when the tx got confirmed, and I could see the sweet ETH in my address on Etherscan, a sense of inner peace came over me. And I've lived in peace ever since. Definitely never doing that again!

BuyETHorDAI,"I think people vastly underestimate how quickly development happens. All of these things you're talking about didn't even exist in 2017. There wasn't a Uniswap, there wasn't MakerDAO, there wasn't Aave, etc. 

I used to tell people in the early days that the first applications we're going to be low throughput, high value transactions and the first dapps we're going to be defi because it's the ""easiest"" in the sense that Ethereum is fundamentally an economic layer. The other low throughput, high value use case is NFTs. 

I think it was pretty clear (at least to me) back then that Ethereum scaling was a journey, not a race. Today we have so many other applications, and yes, they are almost exclusively for well off people. If you can afford to throw 10k on Ethereum and play around even if you lose it all, then you're what Ethereum is made for today. It's not malicious, or designed this way, it's just the nature of blockchains, and scaling and decentralization.

We have all of these fancy new tools and assets that have never existed before, and everyone wants to use them. Unfortunately, not everyone can right now. It's like the internet. Computers we're expensive, internet was expensive, setting up infrastructure was expensive. Imagine people saying ""Why can't I stream Netflix!?"" in 1992. It's because it takes time. Plenty still needs to happen in terms of everything before we can onboard the entire planet. It was always going to be this way, because innovation is hard and competitive, and it takes a lot iteration and time.

nikola_j,"Hey, Mammoths. We wanted to, but it's unfortunately a lot more complex and it would be very hard to pull of in one transaction because of how much gas would be needed.

To put things in perspective, this is the process for MakerDAO: transfer CDP to DSA, claim INST, transfer CDP to dsproxy (+ optionally swap INST to whichever chosen token).

But for a Compound or Aave position it would involve multiple flash loans and likely multiple token transfers to-and fro. The CDP transfer uses as much gas as one token transfer, basically, so really a lot simpler process.

However, once we have the migration for Compound/Aave available from Instadapp DSA to dsproxy/smart wallet you'll be able to do this in two transactions. They have a migration available on their end already (from dsproxy to DSA) which allows you to claim INST, and then you'll have the option to return soon.🤞

***Edit:*** Keep in mind I'm talking about Compound/Aave positions that are on the dsproxy (or what we label as ""Smart Wallet"" in the DeFi Saver UI). 

If you're using Compound or Aave directly with your EOA, in this case the migration back will not be possible any time soon (maybe when/if EIP3074 passes). But you will be able to migrate from the instadapp proxy to the good old dsproxy that we use at DeFi Saver, if you'd rather use DFS.",2021-09-11 22:23:06

There are plenty of sources, I just linked the first I found that was addressing this issue, I didn't write the clickbait title. Is it your only argument? Claiming mine have no foundation when I'm giving you material to look into?

May I remind you which sub you are on?

&gt; Serious &amp; Technical Discussion of CryptoCurrency/Blockchain Technology

I'm asking on a technical sub to have code, paper or a technical article. What you linked does not address your issue, it's just faith-based.

&gt; Clearly you're having stackoverflow withdrawal symptoms...

And you're still trying to discredit me using personal attacks.

&gt; What was promised is going to be delivered. But huge work on the blockchain development side of code doesn't mean coding on the side of smart contracts will take no efforts. Cardano uses a different architecture that requires for an optimal use of its advantages to master design patterns we haven't clearly identified yet because decentralized networks are a new industry that is merely being born at this time.

That would be fine if you didn't pretend at the same time that solutions exist without giving any direction even to your own dev ecosystem and investors.

&gt; So far most blockchains like Ethereum and centered around defi have taken a stance that fast transactions at low cost fees is the most important but that's very narrow minded around finances and it's a mindset that was designed for a different kind of programming than the one that will unleash the real potential of decentralization. Think back when developers had never heard of OOP yet or multiple core CPUs with multiple threads each.

So what kind of programming is Cardano designed for? Slow transactions and high fees?

&gt; Programs now are designed to run around a client, and sometimes with a server replying to the client or connecting multiple clients. Decentralization in essence is a headless entity that shouldn't be designed around a server architecture or really any central entity, even client side, that's the job of the dapp to provide an UI. The blockchain itself is there to save and communicate data, and smart contracts are there to link specific behaviors/rules between the blockchain and the users/wallets, and in the case of a centrally controlled dapp, them too. But the data on the blockchain itself is immutable and provable so it shouldn't be used as a processing power playground but as a data transcriber. 1tps for each wallet address is perfectly acceptable, just stop saving your temp variables on the blockchain lul. the computing power can be done on the dApp client side and upload everything in one packet. that's much more efficient and leaves the blockchain do what it was intended to do. I'm sorry but the defi space is a virtual pollution dump as far as electricity consumption and useless data transmission that saturates the blockchain just because it can take advantage of it. In the eventuality a project needed absolutely a fast blockchain and couldn't work around that they have alternatives other than Cardano, and Cardano is even capable of incorporating other blockchains and tokens in its smart contracts as a side/para chain. In fact it would be king for that use, a global cross chain DEX fully in the hands of decentralized governance.

All I see is the same narrative shift similar to Bitcoin from digital money to digital gold. If Cardano wants to power multiple parachains it needs to have decent throughput at the base layer.
Contrary to what you are saying, Ethereum is not pursuing extra high TPS at the base layers, the future is rollups, aka what you call packing multiple transactions and publishing the results on layer 1. However for transactions worth millions, it is worth it to have the full security of L1.

&gt; In fact it would be king for that use, a global cross chain DEX fully in the hands of decentralized governance.

What characteristics of Cardano makes it better than Cosmos or Polkadot or Ethereum for that purpose especially given it's smart contract limitations?

&gt; Right now it is mainly something in the reach of the smartest and most serious/determined devs because it is still an unknown world to explore.

So you agree that currently there is no solution published?

&gt; Ethereum and TPS blockchains have a linear architecture that is very inefficient when grasping the real potential of what decentralization means. 

What's the real potential of decentralization according to you?

&gt; Especially when decentralized governance is at the core of its architecture, and it is meant to retain value over time. It's not just a blockchain that is meant to be had fun with, used and abused until the next best chain comes up. This isn't Ethereum. 

Please, I appreciate discussing technical merits, there is no need for social jerking here.

&gt; But I kinda became disinterested in 2015 when defi became an ape zoo.

The only DeFi project in 2015 was MakerDAO and being an ape required you to wrap ETH (WETH) then pool ETH (pETH) then get SAI (the Single collateral version before DAI existed).",2021-09-13 01:23:46

&gt;Other factors that may contribute to the potential MATIC price drop are:  
&gt;  
&gt;The release of Ethereum 2.0  
The growth of other layer-1 smart contract platforms like Solana, Avalanche, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;People use layer-2 solutions like Polygon because it has low fees and is fast.  
Why should they continue using it when Ethereum itself offers equally low fees and fast transactions, and other layer-1 blockchains even does a far better job?  
&gt;  
&gt;Without developing some new and unique selling points (USP), I don’t see Layer-2 protocols like Polygon surviving the smart contract chains war that’s coming in 2022 and beyond.

Let me inform you a bit. Ethereum today is miles ahead of it's competitors in terms of innovation. Have a look at EIP 1559, it's one of the best applications of modern day game theory being applied at scale that eliminates the inherent problems of PoS and PoW that happen when the nodes start competing or transaction fees over block rewards when the latter being to decline. You want to look at innovation, it's not coming out of any other shit chain like Solana or Avax or Fantom. Not to mention Ethereum is the most proven robust and decentralized chain today which is only improving. From how I see it, smart contract wars are already over.

Addressing ETH 2.0, I don't know  how misinformed you are, but the affect on gas prices will be negligible. Vitalik envisions users not interacting with L1 all together, so anything that we will interact with will be an L2 rollup, and zero knowledge proofs being the top contender here. Polygon has taken a very pragmatic approach going business first and nurturing this defi ecosystem that exists today.

Please stop looking at polygon through the myopic lens of Polygon PoS chain, the token isn't only this, this chain will be forwarding gasless NFT minting as well as gaming. It's funding over a billion dollars in zk research, the first cross chain governance is being tested in Aave polygon market, cross chain farming on Polydex, and so much more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

USPs you ask? There is a reason we are targeting a niche as a cross-evm scalability aggregator:

* Avail - Data availability solutions for EVMs that plan on being L2s.
* Cross EVM SDK.
* Polygon-Hermez, their very own zkrollup chain.
* Governance - PolygonDAO with major DeFi bluechips.

Polygon won't survive smart contract wars? We are just getting started!! We have the highest rate of adoption in terms of daily active wallets, openSEA NFT users, Ernst and Young just integrated us, D&amp;G had NFT mints, MakerDAO has polygon valuts live,I could go on and on.

Your concerns with 34.5% supply are in no way reflective on the price, AVAX has more to be dumped, ALGO has more to be dumped, LINK has more to be dumped,  ADA has 30% to be released. It's a baseless argument, even when they are considering moving these funds to DAO and actively attracting users through projects and promoting innovation via the remaining tokens.

""Because I’m looking for coins that will give me a 5x to 10x or more within a year and I don’t see MATIC doing that (yet).""

SwagtimusPrime,"You can use Polygon or Arbitrum to buy the token there. Problem solved. Polygon already has CEX support meaning you can deposit your funds straight from an exchange and circumvent L1 fees entirely, and Coinbase Huobi and OKEx have already announced the same for Arbitrum.

A token swap on Polygon is fractions of a cent, on Arbitrum around $1.50 - $2.

Why is it more expensive on Arbitrum? Several reasons. It's a beta release with many more optimizations down the road that will cut down fees, the capacity is throttled to make sure everything works alright - in the future, as this limit is lifted, the more people that use Arbitrum the cheaper the fees will become because fees are split among all users transacting there.

Rollups in particular are still in early stages, but we finally have two EVM-compatible general purpose rollups with Arbitrum and Optimism. Ethereum-aligned dapps (most of them) will deploy there and CEXs will support them so you can avoid L1 fees completely.

zk rollups will be even more efficient, and data sharding will scale rollups to 100,000 tps at a minimum - all without sacrificing decentralization.

Ethereum has changed its roadmap from execution sharding to data sharding, and that means a focus on rollups, because they are much easier to pull off than execution sharding while at the same time being much more scalable and secure.

You can certainly criticize this because it's still early, but the potential is undeniable with $2.3B TVL in Arbitrum right now and big dapps like Curve, Balancer, Uniswap v3, Chainlink, MakerDAO, and more already live and usable.

But to say the gas fees aren't fixed is dishonest - they are fixed, you just need to use rollups. Ethereum L1 will long-term only serve as the ultra-secure and decentralized settlement layer to settle rollup proofs. Rollups is where all the activity is going to be.",2021-09-16 03:35:04

LeagueGreedy,"I have a loan through MakerDao. I have ETH as my collateral and take Dai out for around 2%. I also plan on using my LINK as collateral soon too. Once Rocketpool releases, I’ll use rETH instead of ETH as collateral. Also, MakerDao is coming to Arbitrum soon, so I’ll move everything over there to save on gas fees.

I like to take out around 35% of the value of my collateral in Dai. So sometimes I take out $ or pay some back depending on how the market is to stay around my 35%. I like to use the Dai to yield farm to make some passive income.

I think it’s very smart to take loans out, as long as the gas fees aren’t killing you. Maybe wait until MD is up on Arbitrum first? Where else can you take out a loan for 2% and not have to go through the approval process?

I think it’s perfect for debt leveraging. If you *need* the money and have no means to pay the loan back, you risk liquidation, so I would recommend selling instead. Good luck!

nikola_j,"&gt;But it's nice for Maker/Oasis to offer this functionality ""natively"".

I'm glad you put ""natively"" into quotes, since it's really the same thing in either case. These are both apps that allow people to use the exact same MakerDAO protocol, with additional features built on top of it. Both apps have custom code on top of the Maker protocol to handle these multi-step actions, etc etc.

But I understand where that ""native"" idea comes from for Oasis. It's been the default Maker app for years, though it's now a completely separate team with the Foundation dissolved, albeit still paid by the DAO afaik.

Kinda wish Maker did something like Liquity and highlighted all available Maker management apps (Oasis, DFS, Zerion, Furucombo, Instadapp...) more equally, rather than sticking to this one default app approach.

MerkleChainsaw,"Some very simple points that might be worth bringing up:

1. Virtually everyone in the Ethereum and MakerDAO community agrees that fees are currently too high for small users. Solutions are coming, but developers want to ensure they are as democratized and secure as possible without giving power to any single entity or taking shortcuts. This takes time, and other projects lowering fees through quicker fixes like delegating transactions will be worse for small users in the long run. There's no quick fix to lower fees without hurting users in the long run.
2. Effective regulation could focus on the on and off ramps between cryptocurrencies and USD and consumer education. Fees themselves are market based, so trying to regulate fees is equivalent to regulating the price of a stock. More important is making sure that consumers are educated to the risks they undergo when engaging in markets - and centralized exchanges are in a position to provide those disclosures and education.
3. I think it's important to discuss the relationship between DeFi and TradFi. This new tech can supplement and expand traditional financial markets and present opportunities like increased transparency, more than it presents a threat to Wall Street.
4. Within a few months Ethereum's energy usage should drop over 99%, so transferring value via DAI or other tokens is extremely environmentally friendly compared to transferring BTC.

Good luck!",2021-09-18 00:03:15

DamonAndTheSea,"Regulatory pressure in the US is mounting right now and I expect this to continue.  This will not, in my opinion, lead to some type of 'bank run' on existing CeFi exchanges in the US but rather move along in some piecemeal fashion. 

The US is now paying attention to crypto in a way that we didn't see in prior cycles and this is being forced by total market cap and growing interest in the space.  

Any heavy handed moves on the part of the SEC will be destructive and drive innovation out of the US which would be a net negative.   This whole process is likely to be bumpy and slow as crypto and traditional finance meet one another. 

The risk with CeFi is simply solvency of the custodian and then solvency of the assets staked for yield.   I don't think the larger players like BlockFi, Gemini and Celsius get rug pulled with legislation, but it's certainly possible that new legislation changes how derivative stable token assets are treated in the US. 

As others have pointed out, this stuff is global .. and so projects like Nexo in Switzerland are not compelled along US laws.  A step further would be decentralized yield ala MakerDAO and DAI which move further outside of controls around a central custodian. 

DeFi isn't going away .. but the US government will impose boundaries around this as it grows. This is not a bad thing.  Clarity around rules will allow more capital to flow into the system as it removes risks around ambiguity.",2021-09-18 10:50:55

Separate-Habit5838,"I can see why you'd think that. Frankly, I don't think Reddit comments have the ability to swing the multi-million dollar BUNNY market; there's just not enough people reading. 

I'm expressing my frustration with the immature behavior in crypto in general. I believe in crypto as a long term force of change in the financial industry, but people criticize me, saying it's a huge bubble, and everyone is just looking for a greater fool. 

It's annoying, because there's truth to their words. Every single person in the red on BUNNY is looking for it to spike so they can get their money back. It has nothing to do with the long term (I'm talking years here) value of the project. 

It's a great example of a project that had an enormous amount of irrational investment in it, and I've come back to gloat. Call it a character flaw. 

I bought BUNNY when I knew it was hype fueled. I knew about their sketchy behavior with the time locks and deleting the telegram, so I knew it wasn't a long term investment for me. I intended to capitalize on the hype, and sell to a greater fool. 

When they allowed a SECOND flash loan attack (seriously? They didn't get on a 24/7 code binge to flash-proof their stuff? When millions are at stake?), I knew the hype was over. Somehow, the BUNNY price hadn't been badly affected yet, and I sold. I made money. 

The people sitting with bags badly in the red now are the people we sold to. Hopefully, these people learn. 

Yes, there are many people with red bags hoping for it to pump, but ask yourself this: how many people that don't own BUNNY are looking at this project and thinking: ""wow, what a safe, well-audited project that is severely under-valued! They have brought something innovative to the space that has gone un-noticed! I'm going to make a large purchase for the first time!"". 

No one. No one is thinking that. You know how I know? Because the price is still falling. I hope that the uneducated ""gambling"" forces in crypto start to learn that there's no such thing as free money. ""High APY"" is not a reason to invest in something. They are literally producing a synthetic asset that people are buying on hype with the hope that it will be the ""next big thing"". There are tons of new devs in the space, because they know EVERY new token will have a huge spike when it comes out, putting millions of dollars in their pockets. It takes minimal effort to enter, because they can fork everything (like BUNNY...). That's why the devs are under-equipped to handle things like flash-loan proofing: they've forked the back end to all this stuff. 

I just want people to get smarter. Ethereum is a much better example of what a stable economy looks like. ""BuT tHe ApY iSn't GoOd..."" Yeah, that's the point. You think people are going to PAY you to borrow money (referring to projects like Venus here)? That should sound patently unsustainable on its face, or you just don't understand economics. Why would someone just give away value for nothing in return? You get POSITIVE apy for borrowing several assets of Venus. Compare that the MakerDAO, which is sane, where borrowing everything costs you money. 

It's a bubble. It's the perfect example of a bubble. Hopefully, when it pops for good, crypto will still stand as a viable long-term option for changing society. It definitely won't be any thanks to the gamblers.",2021-09-20 02:59:47

Some coins are supposedly backed 1:1 with the fiat they are linked to, but it turns out they are not and they use complicated financial instruments as securities instead. These ‘fully collateralised’ projects are also centralised which raises concerns of trust and security (the opposite of decentralised cryptocurrencies). The main culprit (see comments) is Tether USDT which is mored in controversy since its inception. 

The other projects are decentralised and either have only a percentage of collateral or no collateral at all, backing them up. They use algorithms and software protocols maintaining their stability. These are vulnerable to hacks and attacks and if anything goes wrong there is less or nothing supporting them. However, MakerDAO (DAI) has been operating since 2015 and has suffered numerous attacks and come out relatively unscathed. I personally trust DAI above all the others.",2021-09-20 16:56:31

Sure-Juggernaut4781,"❓Question of the Week❓
A “stablecoin” is a new class of cryptocurrencies that attempts to offer price stability. They are backed by a reserve asset and often peg their market value to some external reference like a fiat currency such as the US dollar. Since fiat currencies are pegged to an underlying asset, such as gold which acts as collateral, their valuations remain free from wild swings.

Stablecoins have gained traction as they attempt to offer the best of both worlds—the instant processing and security or privacy of payments of cryptocurrencies, and the volatility-free stable valuations of fiat currencies. They also act as a global currency but are not tied to a central bank. Two examples of stablecoins on the market today are: MakerDao (DAI) and Tether (USDT).

Robin_Hood_Jr,"You pointed out a few things that I think are lacking a lot of meaningful context. To your credit, I don't think we do a good a job of educating newer participants in the Maker community of the intricacies of the Maker Protocol, it's quite complex as you've probably realized by now.

**Malicious Governance**

Your main seems to be that you're concerned a coalition of MKR holders could take over governance, and use their votes to enrich themselves. This could be through trying to steal the collateral, minting unbacked Dai, or creating Core Units w/ inflated salaries.

So I think the missing piece here is that there is a Governance Delay before governance actions execute (48 hours), as well as a timebox for when things can execute (M-F US working hours). There is also a module called the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) which bypasses the governance delay. The Emergency Shutdown Module ensures that a minority of MKR token holders can shut down the system and everyone gets settled. Every Dai holder can redeem for $1 worth of collateral, and vault owners have their debt deducted from their collateral and can claim their remaining collateral. In the event of a malicious governance vote   the Emergency Shutdown Module gets triggered before any harm can be done to anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

**Delegation**

You also mentioned that MKR speculators overtime cannot orchestrate meaningful governance voting coalitions. We recently released a governance delegation mechanism which you can see on the Governance Portal here: [https://vote.makerdao.com/delegates?network=mainnet](https://vote.makerdao.com/delegates?network=mainnet) . This allows anyone to delegate their MKR votes to another individual or group. You can even split your delegated votes to different delegates if you so please. One of our VCs a16z, the crypto arm of Andressenn Horowitz,\[ recently published an article\](https://a16z.com/2021/08/26/open-sourcing-our-token-delegate-program/) detailing their delegation allocation which comprises of top Universities like Berkeley, Stanford, MIT, Columbia, Penn, and UCLA among others as well as various other crypto based orgs and non-profits.

Anyone can apply to be a delegate listed on that page, but unless you've been in the Maker or greater crypto community for some time and generated a reputation for being knowledgeable about protocols and active in protocol governance, it's unlikely anyone would delegate meaningful amounts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Transparency**

&gt;There is zero transparency for whether the Maker Dao is truly decentralized, therefore I think the system will eventually collapse and other stable coins will dominate it.

On the contrary, I think MakerDAO is actually the MOST transparently stablecoin. You can \[verify the reserves backing Dai in real-time 24/7\](https://daistats.com/) and know that the data is 100% legitimate because it's coming directly from the blockchain. Other stablecoins like USDC, USDT, and PAX don't show you their reserves at all, or give very infrequent, very abstract details of their reserve holdings backing their stablecoins. 

With respect to Core Units there is \[completely visibility of every transaction from the DAO to the Core Units\](https://makerburn.com/#/expenses/accounting) which detail the amounts, which Core Unit the funds were sent to, as well as the transaction hash. These transactions perfectly align with the allocated budgets that Maker Governance approved which are also completely transparent. To my knowledge, very few DAOs even come close to the level of transparency we exhibit in this regard. As for salaries, I think if you do some more research you'll find they very much line up with expected salaries in the crypto industry. As a fun experiment, try adding the word \`solidity\` to your LinkedIn profile and watch recruiter messages flood in promising similar compensation. Personal anecdote, it's currently almost impossible to hire developers, because everyone is too busy flipping NFTs for multiples of their monthly salary.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scaling**

&gt;Additionally, there are serious scaling issues as the availability of the stable coin is limited by demand for leveraged Ethereum or other assets that may be allowed to be used as collateral in the vault.

Multi-Collateral Dai allows the use many different types of assets to generate Dai, not just Ethereum. This includes other stablecoins like USDC as well as recent introduction of Real World Assets which are uncorrelated with crypto market sentiment. The introduction of Real World Assets into the protocol utilizes a \[novel legal structure which protects the interest of the DAO every step of the way.\]([https://forum.makerdao.com/t/a-walkthrough-of-the-6s-capital-trust-structure/8594](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/a-walkthrough-of-the-6s-capital-trust-structure/8594)). While it's still very early, their introduction enables deals with TradFi institutions to be done which have the potential to generate hundreds of millions of Dai each.",2021-09-21 14:17:18

sfcpfc,"Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but if following the same deploy pattern, couldn't MakerDAO deploy an arbitrary smart contract on address ` 0x1CC7e8e35e67a3227f30F8caA001Ee896D0749eE` on Arbitrum?

According to this [StackOverflow Post](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/760/how-is-the-address-of-an-ethereum-contract-computed),

&gt; The address for an Ethereum contract is deterministically computed from the address of its creator (sender) and how many transactions the creator has sent (nonce). The sender and nonce are RLP encoded and then hashed with Keccak-256.

So on Mainnet, contract [0x1CC7e8e35e67a3227f30F8caA001Ee896D0749eE](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1cc7e8e35e67a3227f30f8caa001ee896d0749ee) was deployed by contract [0xA26e15C895EFc0616177B7c1e7270A4C7D51C997](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa26e15c895efc0616177b7c1e7270a4c7d51c997) which in turn was deployed by EOA [0xdB33dFD3D61308C33C63209845DaD3e6bfb2c674](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdb33dfd3d61308c33c63209845dad3e6bfb2c674).

So, if on Arbitrum EOA `0xdB33dFD3D61308C33C63209845DaD3e6bfb2c674` manages to deploy a ""deployer contract"" at address `0xa26e15c895efc0616177b7c1e7270a4c7d51c997` and that deployer contract manages to deploy a ""returner contract"" at address `0x1cc7e8e35e67a3227f30f8caa001ee896d0749ee`, could the funds be recovered?

What I don't know is what happens if a recently deployed smart contract has pre-existing funds, does it get to access them?

If all of that is correct, recovery may be possible with the help of the holder of the keys for `0xdB33dFD3D61308C33C63209845DaD3e6bfb2c674`. But please don't get your hopes up, it'd be great if a more experienced Ethereum developer could correct me as I'm not sure that everything I said is correct.",2021-09-23 15:49:01
jumnhy,"DAI is the OG stablecoin.

In terms of stability and the risk of coming off peg, DAI is overcollateralized, backed by a large basket of various coins at this point.

The risk would be that during a crash, the value of collateral falls so fast that liquidations (buying out debt for DAI) don't keep up with the overall devaluation in the asset value. Theoretically, if a position becomes under collateralized, the collateral gets auctioned off for DAI. That decreases the overall volume of DAI out there, and in theory keeps the remaining DAI worth approximately $1 each.

Of course, for that to function, the auctions have to collect DAI that is worth at least as much as collateral, and that requires the price oracle that gives MakerDAO the value of the collateral to be functioning right, and auctions need to stay competitive so that they collect sufficient DAI.

During the Black Thursday crash in March 2020, there were issues with the liquidation auctions failing to take bids appropriately, and a substantial portion of collateral was liquidated for winning bids that didn't reflect market value, even zero bids.

All that sounds pretty scary, but here's the kicker: even during that catastrophic crash, DAI was only off peg by about 8% as a result. Substantial changes have been made to both the oracles for asset pricing and to the auction process as a whole, so such an occurrence would be highly unlikely at this point.

Pretty resilient, if you ask me.

 Unlike a CBDC, there's no blacklist, you can transfer DAI as you like. Of course, regulatory risk is there, insofar as you could see DAI being restricted for on/off-ramps like exchanges when converting to fiat. That's the lever that regulators can use; simply transferring value between individuals is a LOT harder to stop.

So yeah, get yourself some DAI.",2021-09-24 00:43:50
jumnhy,"A good chunk of DAI is collateralized with USDC, absolutely. And there are risks with that, both centralization related. A.) Circle pulls a Tether and doesn't retain assets to collateralize their USDC, and B.) Blacklisting/asset freezing.

In part the purpose of that is to help prop up the peg--the peg security module is just a USDC vault that doesn't charge interest and let's you swap DAI for USDC. 

However, in part due to blacklisting risk, Maker is opting to use fungibly-tokenized Uniswap-
V3 USDC-DAI LPTs (via Gelato) to replace their PSM. 

Blacklisted entity would be the pool, not MakerDAO, so no USDC in or out of the pool.

FaceDeer,"Yeah, zero's perhaps jumping the gun - there'll no doubt be speculators willing to vacuum up tokens at fire sale prices for the sake of the wild gamble that something may give them value again. But I suspect for a token like USDC where there's an authority that can say ""we will never redeem tokens on that chain, only tokens on this chain"" it'll drive the price of the non-redeemable tokens down very quickly indeed.

This will have knock-on effects. MakerDAO, for example, has a lot of collateral in the form of stablecoins like USDC. The version of MakerDAO that's on the chain where those crash in value will also crash. MKR holders may well say ""screw it, we're only supporting the chain where we don't have a giant flaming pile of wreckage to clean up"" and shut down MakerDAO over there. Even if they don't, the oracles that MakerDAO relies on will be chain-specific so they'll have to pick which chain to follow as well, further messing things up.

I suspect that we won't ever see another contentious split like ETC as a result of this. On the plus side, that may mean that the devs won't *risk* contentious changes like the TheDAO refund again.

 - Buying 25€ worth of BAT on Uphold every week - automated transaction.
 - Buying 100€ worth of BAT on Kraken every month - manual, market order.
 - Every 6 months - sooner if gas prices are low for some reason: transfer away from the exchanges and into my own wallet, deposit all BAT into a MakerDAO vault.
 - This year and the last: generated DAI from the BAT vault (keep a high collateral ratio), put the DAI it into [Curve's Compound Pool](https://curve.fi/compound).
 - Every two months: sell all the CRV that I received from my stake on the curve pool and exchange it to 1/3 BAT, 1/3 ETH and 1/3 DAI.

What do I get from this strategy?

 - The BAT economy sees some movement.
 - The BAT I buy to hodl is effectively out of circulation and contributing for MakerDAO to be less dependent on USDC and ETH.

ApoIIoCreed,"&gt; Here is their proposal to print MKR to pay themselves. Ridiculous!

You're conflating the actions of the Maker **DAO** with the Maker **Foundation**. The [DAO voted to mint the 995 MKR](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp7-modify-protocol-engineering-core-unit-budget/6832) (&lt;0.1% of total MKR), it was not a unilateral decision by the foundation. If the MakerDAO voted no, it wouldn't have happened. 

&gt; Again, like I said it was a false narrative sold to investors that MKR would burn and be deflationary. 

Current MKR burn rate is over 30,000 MKR/yr, so it is still very much deflationary.",2021-09-25 06:41:25

108record,"# USDC - the better Tether

USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin that is pegged to the price of the US dollar - so 1 USDC = $1. [It operates like this:](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/USD_Coin)

1. A user sends US dollars to the coin issuer's bank account.
2. The issuer uses a USD Coin smart contract to create the equivalent amount of USD Coin.
3. The newly minted USD Coins are sent to the user and the substituted US dollars are held in a reserve.

It was launched on September 26, 2018, in collaboration between Circle and Coinbase, and is an alternative to other USD backed cryptocurrencies like Tether (USDT) or TrueUSD (TUSD). [Bringing US dollars on the blockchain allows moving them anywhere in the world within minutes, and brings much-needed stability to cryptocurrencies. Additionally, it opens up new opportunities for trading, lending, risk-hedging and more.](https://cryptonews.com/coins/usd-coin/)

&amp;#x200B;

# Pros

**Very reliable leadership team &amp; founders**

* USD Coin is [developed by the Centre Consortium](https://www.centre.io/usdc), a partnership between Circle and Coinbase. The technology and governing framework are developed by Centre, while Circle and Coinbase were the first commercial issuers of USDC.
   * Circle is an [official Money Transmitter](https://www.circle.com/en/legal/us-licenses), which makes the company an open financial book, connoting that all USDC tokens are regulated, transparent and verifiable.
   * Additionally, Circle is one of the only crypto companies [backed by Goldman Sachs](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/goldman-sachs-backed-circle-goes-live-with-currency-linked-stablecoin-and-anyone-can-issue-it-2018-09-26), a renowned investment bank.
   * Coinbase, the other 'half' of the Consortium, is the world's second biggest crypto exchange with billions of dollars in daily volume, so it is highly unlikely that they will perpetrate a stablecoin scam.
   * Moreover, Coinbase stock is already on the market while [Circle plans to go public via a SPAC](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/cryptocurrency-company-circle-to-go-public-in-spac-deal/) \- which incentivizes them to keep running the USDC project lest their stock prices plummet.
* Meanwhile, Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin in the world, has only 13 employees and is the [most valuable company on a per-employee basis in the entire world](https://cryptowhale.medium.com/the-tether-scandal-the-biggest-threat-to-the-crypto-ecosystem-23a169003205).
   * This is similar to the Madoff Ponzi scheme of the early 2000s, in which he robbed $65 billion of investors' money.
* Thus, USDC is the largest trustworthy stablecoin in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reserves are safe and are audited every month**

* A top 5 accounting firm, Grant Thornton, releases audits of Circle's reserves every month. Its [August report](https://www.centre.io/hubfs/pdfs/attestation/2021%20Circle%20Examination%20Report%20August%202021%20Final.pdf?hsLang=en) revealed that:
   * There were no discrepancies in the market cap of USDC and the value of Circle's reserves.
   * The reserves themselves consisted of 92% cash &amp; cash equivalents, 1% corporate bonds, 5% USD denominated Certificates of Deposits, and 2% commercial paper.
* [In a crisis, there’s a strong chance that Circle would be able to meet significant USDC redemptions, if not instantly, then within a short timeframe. Putting it another way, if regulators bring in rules about the quality of assets that need to back stablecoins, it’s likely that USDC assets would easily comply.](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/circle-publishes-details-of-usdc-stablecoin-asset-backing/) And that can’t be said for Tether by a wide margin. 
* The degree of transparency and quality of Circle's assets is significantly superior compared to USDT, where the asset backing raised concerns at the [Boston Federal Reserve](https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/speeches/2021/official-monetary-and-financial-institutions-forum-fed-week-financial-stability-session.aspx) and [Fitch](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/fitch-flags-stablecoin-risks-to-short-term-credit-markets/). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Plenty of native uses as opposed to USDT**

* Coinbase offers [no fees when spending USDC](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/pricing-and-fees/) using the well-known Coinbase Card.
   * This incentivizes Coinbase users to utilise USDC to spend, rather than other cryptocurrencies.
* [VISA recently became the first major payments to allow the settlement of transactions in USDC.](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.releaseId.17821.html)
   * While this doesn't benefit consumers as of now, it allows crypto-holding companies such as [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) and Tesla to natively transact USDC on VISA, eliminating the need to convert their crypto to fiat.
* Compare this to Tether, whose only 'partner company', Bitfinex, is actually the entity that controls USDT itself.

&amp;#x200B;

**Available on a variety of blockchains**

* [USDC is powered by an ERC-20 smart contract in the Ethereum blockchain and is also supported on other blockchains (Algorand, Solana, Tron, Stellar).](https://swissborg.com/blog/usdc-vs-usdt) It is an open-source project, which makes it a transparent and verifiable stablecoin on the blockchain. 
* In addition, in the next few months [Circle is planning to add USDC to 9 more blockchains](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/06/29/usdc-stablecoin-could-soon-expand-to-10-more-blockchains/), including Avalanche, Celo, Flow, Hedera, Kava, Nervos, Polkadot, Stacks, and Tezos.
   * This will put it significantly ahead of USDT, which only supports 7 blockchains as of now.
* Each network has its own perks and flaws, all of which comprehensively make USDC more useful than it ever was.

&amp;#x200B;

**Can be staked for yields**

* [By staking USDC, you can earn](https://www.blockfer.com/earn-interest/stablecoin-interest-calculator/):
   * 8.6% APY on BlockFi
   * 8% APY on [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com)
   * 11.55% on Celsius Network
   * Native earnings if you hold it on Coinbase
   * ... and many more options
* On another note, you can also utilise USDC to mitigate liquidity risk by using it as collateral for DAI in MakerDAO.
* However, nearly all stablecoins can be staked for yields, some more than others.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, USDC is undoubtedly a better stablecoin than Tether, and its multitude of uses justifies its $30 billion marketcap.",2021-09-25 06:53:33

Ethereum forked when the DAO was hacked, essentially making the hacked funds unspendable:

The poly hack you mentioned, Binance and other exchanges also agreed to freeze not just USDT but all of the stolen funds ( thats probably why they eventually got returned)

Bitcoin, and most other cryptos also give anyone operating a node the option to blacklist individual addresses, that means if there is a large enough agreement between controlling parties (say all the large exchanges) addresses from BTC or pretty much any other blockchain can be blacklisted:

The airdrop was available for Maker, Compound and Aave cdp holders that had any balances in their positions at the time of their snapshot, which was mid-June.

If you had a Maker CDP open at the time, you can still load up in [https://app.defisaver.com/makerdao/](https://app.defisaver.com/makerdao/) (no need to connect wallet, just enter address/ens for monitoring) and the INST button should show up in the topbar of the dashboard.

nikola_j,"&gt;As I understand it each CDP has a DSProxy linked to it

It's actually the other way around. [Here's](https://imgur.com/mc7HrX2) a silly paint.exe illustration I did to explain the relations.

A [DSProxy](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-proxy) is a smart contract that is created and owned by your EOA (your account that you have loaded up in your MetaMask or Ledger or whichever wallet interface) and your DSProxy then holds any number of Maker Vaults on it. Effectively, it's being used as a smart contract wallet, with your EOA being the only owner and manager.

The DSProxy was first popularised [by MakerDAO](https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/devtools/working-with-dsproxy/working-with-dsproxy.md) and later adopted by other major protocols such as Balancer and Reflexer, but also by us at DeFi Saver, where we use it to keep positions in any number of integrated protocols. Note that your one DSProxy holds all of those positions.

But the cool thing about the DSProxy is that it also enables additional authorisations to be made on it, which is how DFS Automation is made possible. The smart contracts [audit](https://medium.com/defi-saver/defi-saver-automation-security-audit-summary-a883d4fde1b) briefly explains it.

Finally, to answer your question about transactions showing up on Etherscan - you'll need to switch to the ""Internal Txns"" tab and also turn on ""Advanced view"" so all transactions executed through your DSProxy show up. Here's one random example illustrating where you will find those: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x251c36771e862d77651ae47cac5ce6d425610576/advanced#internaltx](https://etherscan.io/address/0x251c36771e862d77651ae47cac5ce6d425610576/advanced#internaltx)

Alternatively, you can also find the list of all (manual and automated) adjustments made to Maker vaults using [https://defiexplore.com/](https://defiexplore.com/). There's also a CSV export option at the bottom of any CDP's history page there.",2021-09-28 02:08:43

lanceparkerusa,"Sure.  During DeFI summer (2020) people were minting DAI (MakerDAO) with ETH, then using DAI to buy more ETH to mint more DAI.

They pool multiple properties together like a MBS(mortgage-backed security) then tokenize it and MakerDao mints the DAI for it.

But assuming it did and continuing your example, if your collateral dropped to 1450 USD in value, they would need to liquidate 100 USD to pay off 100 DAI of your debt, leaving you with 900 DAI debt and 1350 USD worth of ETH collateral, with a collateral ratio of 150%.",2021-09-28 22:15:34

First, I had no idea that the DAI withdrawn from a CDP wasn't taxable! Thankyou, this changes everything for me and I'm looking into making a CDP right now. I've been in ETH since 2016 and gave up on using most defi because of taxes. 

That out of the way. If a CDP is liquidated due to low collateral ratio how much of the liquidated CDP is settled back to its creator? I ask, because the documentation I'm seeing says that after the debt is covered and fees are covered the remainder is settled back to the creator of the CDP. But I remember some people got 100% liquidated during a flash crash in the market 2 or so years ago. Is this something that has been fixed since in the MakerDao protocol, or is this risk still present?

This was March of 2020 during the Covid black swan and was a combination of abnormally high gas prices for the time and the immaturity of the Keeper ecosystem which are bots that bid on liquidated CDPs. Gas prices skyrocketed which caused a lot of Keeper bots to cease functioning as they were poorly coded and since everything was so new there were only a handful of Keepers in the first place which meant at one point only ONE Keeper was active and was submitting $0 bids for CDPs and winning. The Maker protocol itself actually worked great and weathered the storm. Keepers immediately fixed their bots and the community quickly built scripts so that anyone could run a Keeper to prevent this from happening again.

If another black swan happened the system should function normally as there's a robust system of Keepers now so you'd only lose 13% during a liquidation.",2021-09-29 20:34:05
